    "header_summary": "Maxim Orlovsky announces the stable release of the RGB project's consensus layer, RGB-I-0, after extensive development, emphasizing its significance in client-side validation technology and the integration of zk-STARK support to enhance protocol functionality. The release is a key milestone in the project's history, marking the beginning of forward compatibility for developers and contract issuers, with an anticipation of further releases focusing on libraries to maintain contract compatibility. Detailed information about the release and its features can be found in the [official announcement](https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-12-consensus/).\n\nAaron Zhang explores the practical application of Taproot mechanisms within Bitcoin, demonstrating the construction of a Taproot address with multiple spending paths and providing a byte-by-byte analysis of control blocks. His work, which includes detailed examinations and practical demonstrations on the Bitcoin testnet, serves as an educational resource for developers interested in advanced Bitcoin scripting capabilities. Zhang's analysis and resources are available through his Medium posts ([Part 1](https://medium.com/@aaron.recompile/building-a-4-leaf-taproot-tree-in-python-the-first-complete-implementation-on-bitcoin-testnet-c8b66c331f29), [Part 2](https://medium.com/@aaron.recompile/taproot-control-block-deep-analysis-stack-execution-visualization-5ff10f98032c)), and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/btcstudy/btcstudy.github.io/tree/main/Not-Just-Hodling:bitcoin-script-Engineering/demo3_taproot_4leaf).\n\nJonas Nick discusses the security considerations of using WOTS+ over WOTS in Bitcoin development, highlighting the potential security reduction with RMD160 and the implications of quantum computing on cryptographic security. This discussion underscores the importance of selecting hash algorithms that balance security and efficiency in the face of advancing quantum computing technologies, with further details available in the provided [contextual discussion](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/h9N4uIp0MgaASuEBpqsHjiQb9ahGbca3mG5V6iPVumT9ICT4monwV1ScgV3kdV2ka9CkQiSqEGkxA_eqqGQJ1TtFmWUlJEhi0McZU6yGBl0=@proton.me/T/#m5143408c20ebdb01c0f7983048d968b88a8f6762).\n\nThe LNP/BP Standards Association launches the final production-ready release of the RGB smart contracts consensus layer, version 0.12, highlighting significant protocol simplifications and advancements in payment processes, performance, and security. This release marks a pivotal moment for contract developers and the future of smart contracts on the Bitcoin mainnet, with resources and further information available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RGB-WG/rgb/tree/v0.12.0-rc.1.1).",
