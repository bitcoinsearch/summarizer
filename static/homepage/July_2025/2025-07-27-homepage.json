    "header_summary": "Antoine Poinsot clarifies a critical aspect of multiparty transaction protocols in Bitcoin, emphasizing that non-standard inputs are not considered attacks but rather an inherent part of the system's trustless nature, highlighting the balance between security and functionality in cryptocurrency systems. This discussion also addresses a new limit for transactions involving legacy script inputs to mitigate potential issues, demonstrating the ongoing adjustments to Bitcoin's protocol to maintain network robustness ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/49dyqqkf5NqGlGdinp6SELIoxzE_ONh3UIj6-EB8S804Id5yROq-b1uGK8DUru66eIlWuhb5R3nhRRutwuYjemiuOOBS2FQ4KWDnEh0wLuA=@protonmail.com/T/#m6bb53227b0fc33fe8e3f962df7f8ca6143c258d6)).\n\nConduition raises concerns about the practicality of integrating the WebAuthn standard with Bitcoin, due to its potential incompatibility with key features like deterministic backup seeds and hierarchical deterministic wallets, alongside the challenges of adapting it for decentralized systems prioritizing user autonomy. This discussion extends to the feasibility and timing of integrating new signature algorithms into the Bitcoin protocol, juxtaposed against the rapid advancements in post-quantum cryptography, suggesting a strategic reevaluation of development priorities within the community ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/GVA2lG8TET5qUPOU8JlHttBNLbTskqr_dbhzK9aOe_ZsPsNDyk2kWIPwmx3ngTchlGrsAIpubrVl24qmyqVgBvrZ8FT0POeomam2qB6-cqk=@proton.me/T/#mb4648d11e6487def3a9204054abf8fe08f23543a)).\n\nTim Ruffing's analysis of the post-quantum security of Bitcoin's Taproot as a commitment scheme offers reassurance against the threat of quantum computing to script-path spending, outlining a potential two-phase softfork upgrade path for integrating post-quantum signatures. This research provides a significant foundation for future-proofing Bitcoin against quantum attacks and emphasizes the current security adequacy based on SHA256's resilience ([source](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1307)).\n\nA novel proposal by davidtaubmann aims to combat money centralization in Bitcoin by limiting wallet creation to one per individual, verified through national identity numbers or biometrics, suggesting a radical shift towards a more equitable distribution of wealth within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This approach, however, challenges the anonymity and decentralization principles traditionally associated with Bitcoin, proposing a significant paradigm shift towards reducing inequality and corruption ([original post](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32897?reload=1?reload=1)).",
