    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the release of Bitcoin Core 28.2, featuring new functionalities, bug fixes, and performance improvements aimed at enhancing user experience and software compatibility across various operating systems. This update, available for download on the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.2/), includes significant changes such as the notarization of the MacOS app bundle and codesigning of all MacOS and Windows binaries, alongside updates to testing processes and documentation. The development team, including contributors like 0xB10C and MarcoFalke, encourages user feedback through the GitHub issue tracker to refine future versions.\n\nIn another discussion, roasbeef highlights the operational nuances of onion messaging within the Lightning Network, specifically its non-mirrored nature against the channel graph topology which allows nodes without direct channels to establish and broadcast onion links. This conversation points to the efficiency gains from using distinct TCP or QUIC connections for onion messaging, as detailed in the initial BOLT specification, to avoid delays and bottlenecks in message propagation, underscoring the importance of technical specifications for unified network behavior. Further insights into this topic are accessible via the [BOLT specification](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/68881992b97f20aca29edf7a4d673b8e6a70379a/01-messaging.mdconnection-handling-and-multiplexing).\n\nJosh introduces a library aimed at reducing the size of QR codes for wallets by 30-40%, enhancing the encoding of descriptors that include private keys for more efficient QR code and NFC communication. This improvement facilitates easier sharing and storage of complex multisig configurations and supports all descriptor types with a focus on compactness and reliability. The library, a contribution to the `descriptor-encrypt` project, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/joshdoman/descriptor-codec), with detailed documentation provided at [https://docs.rs/descriptor-codec/latest/descriptor_codec](https://docs.rs/descriptor-codec/latest/descriptor_codec).\n\nDanielabrozzoni delves into the privacy risks associated with a fingerprint attack on nodes operating across multiple networks, as evidenced by their `ADDR` responses. This research, aiming to mitigate potential network threats and enhance user privacy, suggests strategies like randomizing or removing timestamps from `ADDR` messages to prevent attackers from correlating nodes across networks. The discussion, rooted in findings from a study conducted in January 2025 and documented in both a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28760) and a [research paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/coinscope/coinscope.pdf), emphasizes the community's role in developing solutions to these security challenges.",
