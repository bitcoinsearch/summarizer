    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the release of Bitcoin Core version 28.1, highlighting new features, bug fixes, performance enhancements, and the update's compatibility with major operating systems. This version also introduces a change in the peer-to-peer configuration to prevent port collisions for users running multiple nodes. Users are encouraged to download the update from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1) and report any issues on GitHub. \n\nJameson Lopp raised concerns on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List about the potential for manipulation of transaction prioritization through the misuse of timestamp data, such as nLockTime, by adversaries. This manipulation could undermine new prioritization rules and lead to a \"race to the bottom,\" making the rules ineffective. The discussion underscores the need for careful consideration in securing transaction timestamp integrity to prevent gaming of the system. Further details can be found [here](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/f1a0153b-3142-4e01-a68e-92c458762b89@dashjr.org/T/#md45faf348c4d6ff9b7a87019770ad6967382bd2a).\n\nA proposal by Matt Corallo suggests an innovative approach to blockchain changes through soft forks by disabling key spending on P2TR addresses and using `OP_SUCCESS` opcodes for a post-quantum signature scheme, indicating a shift towards more secure and space-saving methods. This proposition has sparked discussions on the implementation of hash-based signatures, with a focus on efficiency and future-proofing against quantum computing threats. The detailed proposal and ongoing discussions can be explored [here](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/8O857bRSVV8).\n\nAntoine Riard is considering legal action against Matthew Corallo over disagreements stemming from their collaboration on the rust-lightning project, highlighting deeper issues of governance and respect within open-source software projects. Riard's move underscores the challenges of collaboration in decentralized environments and the potential for legal precedents in open-source governance. This development has attracted attention beyond their immediate network, emphasizing the complexities of leadership and contribution in the open-source community.
