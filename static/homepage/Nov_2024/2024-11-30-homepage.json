    "header_summary": "A new initiative for gathering Bitcoin developer insights on covenant proposals has been set in motion, aiming to foster consensus for future soft forks by utilizing a draft Bitcoin wiki page, similar to the approach for SegWit support. This endeavor, detailed at [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support), encourages developers to contribute by adding relevant opcodes and sharing their opinions, highlighting the importance of community input in refining proposals such as OP_CTV to enhance implementations like coinjoin. \n\nJeremy introduced an innovative method for implementing Bitcoin covenants without altering the native protocol, leveraging covenant emulators and signing servers. This approach, which necessitates oracle signers to deposit bonds at risk of confiscation for violating covenant rules, offers a novel solution for enforcing covenants and is further elaborated in a paper available at [https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2024/11/26/unfed-covenants/](https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2024/11/26/unfed-covenants/).\n\nDiscussions also explored the technical and economic implications of blockchain reorganizations and the potential benefits of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) broadcast in blockchain systems. While examining the challenges of achieving consensus in permissionless systems, contributors like mplsgrant and jungly emphasized the strategic use of BFT broadcasts within known membership pools to streamline project development, as seen with Radpool\u2019s approach towards a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP), detailed at [Radpool's strategy](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/radpool-decentralised-mining-pool-with-futures-contracts-for-payouts/1262/7).",
