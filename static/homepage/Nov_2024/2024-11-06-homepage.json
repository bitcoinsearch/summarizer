    "header_summary": "Antoine Poinsot announced the release of new security advisories addressing historical issues in Bitcoin Core, emphasizing the project's commitment to transparent security practices. These advisories, along with a detailed disclosure policy, can be found on their [official website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/11/05/cb-stall-hindering-propagation) and highlight the completion of a process initiated in July to enhance security transparency.\n\nAdam Borcany introduced an innovative approach for securing Bitcoin transactions through proof-of-work (PoW) locked outputs, offering a more granular difficulty adjustment than current methods. This novel method, bypassing the limitations of signature grinding by using a fixed set of signatures and private keys, suggests a more efficient and flexible system for transaction security, as outlined in a [detailed discussion](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAOY=fzk-ksDGT_oyCKF=EJnnXaXoCbfCzxW+9PBQV=us-K=PuQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#m6466fc7480c6cde4dc938a788051920242c7231c).\n\nResearch highlighted by cndolo reveals potential censorship vulnerabilities within the Lightning Network, caused by the centralization of network layers and the identifiability of TCP headers. The study proposes several countermeasures, such as adaptive padding techniques and leveraging AS information in pathfinding algorithms, to enhance resistance against censorship, emphasizing the need for improved privacy and decentralization measures within the network. The full exploration of these vulnerabilities and proposed solutions is available at [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/research-paper-on-ln-payment-censorship/1248).\n\nZmnSCPxj proposes the SuperScalar mechanism to address the Lightning Service Provider (LSP) Last-Mile Problem, enabling efficient and secure liquidity provisioning without blockchain consensus changes. This comprehensive solution leverages Decker-Wattenhofer channel factories, timeout trees, and pseudo-Spilman leaves to facilitate scalability, security, and decentralized liquidity management, marking a significant advancement in addressing the challenges of incoming liquidity for new users on the Lightning Network. The technical details and implications of this proposal are discussed at [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/superscalar-laddered-timeout-tree-structured-decker-wattenhofer-factories-with-pseudo-spilman-leaves/1242).",
