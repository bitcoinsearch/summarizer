    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.1rc1 release candidate binaries, inviting the community for testing and feedback. The binaries and source code are accessible for download and review, with preliminary release notes providing insights into the updates and enhancements expected in this version. This step is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of the upcoming official release, marking its readiness for wide adoption across the Bitcoin network ([Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1/test.rc1/), [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.1rc1)).\n\nAntoine Riard detailed a newly identified transaction-relay jamming attack on bitcoin's time-sensitive contracting protocols, specifically affecting lightning channels. This report outlines the attack's technical feasibility, potential impact, and proposed mitigation strategies for lightning node operators and off-chain protocol developers. The discussions around these vulnerabilities, which had been initially raised in 2020, have gained renewed attention due to their implications for network security and the operation of lightning channels ([source URL](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALZpt+EptER=p+P7VN3QAb9n=dODA9_LnR9xZwWpRsdAwedv=w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#m4fcd81d3fbf25a2571b51eba2221cea7238279cd)).\n\nHubertusVIE discussed the economic challenges hindering Bitcoin's potential as a viable currency, proposing a Bitcoin-based Chaumian ecash layer to address these issues. This approach, emphasizing the importance of fungibility through blinded signatures, aims to transform Bitcoin into a practical form of cash without altering its core protocol. The discussion extends to the necessary technological infrastructures, such as the Lightning Network, to overcome Bitcoin's adoption hurdles as a mainstream medium of exchange, further detailed in an ongoing series accessible at [https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange](https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange).\n\nIn a discussion led by jungly, the complexities of managing payments within a network of Mining Service Providers (MSPs) through FROST signatures are examined, highlighting the need for consensus on share contributions and the challenges of ensuring network integrity. This system, detailed at [Radpool](https://www.radpool.xyz/1/stratum.html_verifiable_share_ownership), proposes a decentralized approach to block template production, aiming to enhance decentralization and cater to miner preferences more effectively than current centralized models.",
