    "header_summary": "Jeremy proposes an innovative security model for vaults that incentivizes the honesty of signing oracles through continuous payment, contrasting with the one-time gain from potential dishonesty. This model employs private key generation and suggests using a 2-of-2 multisignature setup to limit oracles' ability to compromise the system, addressing the challenge of ensuring continuous operation or \"liveness\" through multiple security mechanisms [source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/30440182-3d70-48c5-a01d-fad3c1e8048en@googlegroups.com/T/#m8423420dacdd1cb73ef8cdf320e3a0351fbd427a).\n\n/dev /fd0 launches an initiative to gather Bitcoin developers' opinions on various covenant proposals, aiming to build consensus for upcoming soft forks through a collaborative approach similar to the SegWit support page. This effort is facilitated by a draft Bitcoin wiki page, which lists relevant opcodes and invites further contributions, emphasizing the importance of developer input in simplifying the process towards the next soft fork [source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/028c0197-5c45-4929-83a9-cfe7c87d17f4n@googlegroups.com/T/#u#m91e5a68b8275a73acdcc8fc2276b9caf678fdab4).\n\nEthan Heilman delves into the cryptographic principles of proving the equivalence of two variables in a scripting context, highlighting the complexity and nuances in Bitcoin development and cryptographic security. This discussion illustrates the use of OP_DUP operation to demonstrate absolute certainty in script values, underscoring the importance of understanding script operations and transaction semantics [source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAEM=y+W2jyFoJAq9XrE9whQ7EZG4HRST01TucWHJtBhQiRTSNQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#ma6bea9a7a49e563fd36ff17be9adfab7456d314b).\n\nIn a collaborative effort, sCrypt and StarkWare demonstrate the feasibility of a bridge covenant on Bitcoin, connecting it to the Starknet Layer 2 network. This proof-of-concept showcases advanced scripting for managing deposit and withdrawal requests efficiently, leveraging a secure Merkle tree structure for transaction integrity and security. The initiative paves the way for further exploration and development in Bitcoin's ecosystem, offering a technical foundation for building bridges and enhancing interoperability with Layer 2 networks [source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/implementing-a-bridge-covenant-on-op-cat-enabled-bitcoin-a-proof-of-concept/1291).",
