    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.1rc1 release candidate binaries for community testing, with the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.1rc1). This version introduces updates, fixes, and enhancements detailed in the preliminary release notes found on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v28.1rc1/doc/release-notes.md), marking a significant milestone in Bitcoin Core development.\n\nAntoine Riard detailed a new transaction-relay jamming attack on bitcoin time-sensitive contracting protocols, specifically affecting lightning channels. This attack, emphasizing its significant financial requirement for execution, highlights vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin network's transaction selection and propagation mechanisms. Proposed mitigation strategies focus on measures for lightning node operators and off-chain protocol developers, suggesting further research into comprehensive solutions at the base-layer level. The detailed timeline from initial findings to public disclosure underscores the collaborative effort in addressing this vulnerability.\n\nIn a separate thread, discussions by harding and fiatjaf revealed vulnerabilities and advancements in blockchain and lightning network technologies. They discussed old versions of major Lightning Network implementations being susceptible to attacks that could misappropriate channel funds, with mitigation efforts focusing on protocol and transaction relay protocol updates. Additionally, fiatjaf presented a breakthrough using APO as an overridable CTV in blockchain transactions, despite identifying a vulnerability within the system's design, showcasing both the potential and challenges in evolving blockchain technology [GitHub](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/soma).\n\nLastly, HubertusVIE explored Bitcoin's viability as a real-world currency, attributing its primary obstacle to economic rather than technical factors, such as volatility. The proposed solution involves a Bitcoin-based Chaumian ecash layer to enhance fungibility without altering Bitcoin's core protocol, suggesting a strategic approach to overcome economic hurdles for mainstream Bitcoin adoption as detailed in an ongoing series at [https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange](https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange).",
