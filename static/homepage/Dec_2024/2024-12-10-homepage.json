    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.1rc1 release candidate binaries for community testing, alongside the source code on GitHub, with detailed preliminary release notes to guide users through the new features and changes. This version, aimed at improving Bitcoin's stability and reliability, is accessible for download and review, marking a critical phase before its official release across the Bitcoin network ([Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1/test.rc1/), [GitHub source](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.1rc1), [Release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v28.1rc1/doc/release-notes.md)).\n\nHubertusVIE explores the economic challenges hindering Bitcoin's adoption as a viable currency, proposing the implementation of a Bitcoin-based Chaumian ecash layer to address issues of volatility and fungibility without altering Bitcoin's core protocol. This approach, coupled with the Lightning Network, aims to transform Bitcoin into a practical medium of exchange by overcoming its economic barriers, with further insights available in an ongoing series ([Bitcoin Dilemma Series](https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange)).\n\nAjtowns and jungly delve into technical discussions, with ajtowns critiquing the evaluation of ctv-signet's utility based on narrow metrics and highlighting its role in supporting real-world applications like the Babylon project. Meanwhile, jungly presents a method for managing payments within a network of Mining Service Providers (MSPs) through FROST signatures, emphasizing consensus on share contributions and the implementation of protective measures against DDoS attacks, which could decentralize block template production and enhance the mining framework's resilience ([Signet utility](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/ctv-apo-cat-activity-on-signet/1257/10), [MSP Payment Management](https://www.radpool.xyz/1/stratum.html_verifiable_share_ownership)).",
