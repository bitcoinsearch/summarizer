    "header_summary": "Yuval Kogman introduces a nuanced framework for evaluating developer sentiments towards proposals in technical communities, distinguishing between technical merit and perceived community support. This approach addresses the conflation issue in traditional models by allowing developers to abstain from speculating on community support while still expressing a technical stance. The discussion draws on the Keynesian beauty contest analogy to emphasize the speculative nature of gauging collective opinions, suggesting a more flexible and expressive system for capturing diverse viewpoints ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAAQdECALHHysr4PNRGXcFMCk5AjRDYgquUUUvuvwHGoeJDgZJA@mail.gmail.com/T/#m9514dfbbdecae448769fbbfb1698b1ab047de85b)).\n\nAva Chow announces the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.1rc1 release candidate binaries for testing, highlighting the importance of community engagement in the software development cycle. This step allows for the identification and rectification of any issues before the final release, emphasizing the role of developers and users in ensuring the stability and reliability of the new version. The binaries and source code are accessible for review and compilation, with preliminary release notes provided to outline the updates and enhancements introduced ([Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1/test.rc1/)).\n\nAntoine Riard reports on a transaction-relay jamming attack targeting bitcoin's time-sensitive contracting protocols, notably affecting lightning channels. This sophisticated strategy manipulates transaction selection and propagation to disrupt network functionality, underscoring the continuous evolution of threats in decentralized financial systems. The report details attack variants, practical implications, and proposed mitigation strategies, calling for further investigation and collaboration among stakeholders to enhance network resilience against such adversarial tactics ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALZpt+EptER=p+P7VN3QAb9n=dODA9_LnR9xZwWpRsdAwedv=w@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#m4fcd81d3fbf25a2571b51eba2221cea7238279cd)).\n\nIn a distinct technical advancement, sCrypt-ts develops a smart contract for operating sidechains pegged to Bitcoin without major protocol upgrades like BIP300. This innovation utilizes OP_CAT for establishing sidechain covenants, demonstrating a significant step forward in exploring new features or experimental technologies within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The smart contract's code, available on GitHub, illustrates the potential of using complex contract functionalities to enhance Bitcoin's utility while maintaining the integrity of its core protocol ([GitHub](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/cat-contracts/blob/master/src/contracts/driveChain.ts)).",
