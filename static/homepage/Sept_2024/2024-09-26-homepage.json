    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announces the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.0rc2 binaries, marking a significant step toward the release of a new major version, with the binaries and source code accessible for testing and review [here](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/test.rc2) and [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.0rc2). This version enters the release candidate stage, indicating a phase of extensive testing and final adjustments before the official release, with preliminary release notes available for public review [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Notes-Draft).\n\nAndyschroder introduces 'Lightning Cheques,' a novel paper-based payment system for the cryptocurrency sphere, designed for offline transactions via the Lightning Network, combining a BOLT12 `invoice_request` and an `offer` on a printed format for easy, internet-independent transactions. This model aims to mimic cash transactions while introducing a trust-based system for change issuance, with potential enhancements like NFC technology for future improvements, detailed [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lightning-cheques/1162).\n\nVirtu presents a novel method for encoding various network addresses within DNS AAAA records, offering a new way to integrate onion (Tor), I2P, and CJDNS addresses into DNS queries with about 50% encoding efficiency. This approach, which uses the ff00::/8 IPv6 prefix for custom encoding, maintains compatibility with standard DNS resolution tools and does not interfere with server-side caching mechanisms, showcasing a blend of innovation with practicality for DNS-based applications to incorporate alternative network addresses, as discussed [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/hardcoded-seeds-dns-seeds-and-darknet-nodes/1123/11).",
