    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the availability of Bitcoin Core's version v28.0rc1 for download and testing, marking a significant update with detailed release notes to guide users and developers through the new features and improvements. This version is a step forward in the software's development, emphasizing the community's role in refining the release through real-world testing and feedback. Preliminary information and resources for this release candidate can be found at [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/28.0-Release-Notes-Draft).\n\nAntoine Riard advocates for the establishment of \"free-to-pwn\" lightning nodes on Bitcoin's mainnet to facilitate real-world testing of sophisticated cross-layer attacks, such as pinning. This initiative aims to enhance the ecosystem's security by demonstrating attack feasibility and severity in a controlled environment, contrasting with less realistic testnet scenarios. The proposal details and the rationale behind using default mainnet settings for a more accurate assessment are discussed at [Linux Foundation's mailing list archive](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-May/018925.html).\n\nVictor K. of StarkWare highlights the potential for achieving general computation on Bitcoin, leveraging the Taproot upgrade and proposing the re-enabling of OP_CAT opcode for enhanced script expressibility and complexity. This development could revolutionize Bitcoin's utility, enabling smart contracts and sophisticated off-chain computation verification through STARK proofs. The conversation outlines the technical and conceptual advancements towards embedding more complex applications on the Bitcoin blockchain, with further details available at [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/the-path-to-general-computation-on-bitcoin-with-op-cat/1106).\n\nFi3 discusses the ongoing development of an SV2 extension designed to improve mining pool payout transparency and fairness by allowing miners to select transactions and influence mining job fee structures. This initiative, which builds on the Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares system, is in the review stage and seeks contributions to refine the proposal, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing miner autonomy and efficiency in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. The project's specifics and operational framework are detailed in the proposal at [GitHub](https://github.com/demand-open-source/share-accounting-ext/blob/281c1cbc4f9a07b21a443753a525197dc5d8e18c/extension.md).",
