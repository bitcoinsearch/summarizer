[Further details](https://petertodd.org)\n\n0xB10C's analysis on compact block reconstruction within the Bitcoin network highlights adjustments in node configurations affecting block reconstruction efficiency. The study suggests enabling `mempoolfullrbf` by default and further investigates the impact of network congestion on block reconstruction times, hinting at potential improvements in network-wide block propagation times.
