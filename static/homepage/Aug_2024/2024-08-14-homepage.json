    "header_summary": "Matt Corallo highlights the challenges Bitcoin pooled mining faces, such as block withholding attacks that miners execute by submitting shares without producing valid blocks. This practice, which undermines the pool's success, can be detected through increased computational efforts and statistical analysis, emphasizing the pools' need for robust defense mechanisms. Corallo also criticizes the potential undermining of Bitcoin's decentralization through Stratum V2's work selection process, advocating for miners' autonomy in selecting work to preserve the network's decentralized nature ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/26322ee8-08e6-4718-8d1c-60bca8c13c6a@mattcorallo.com/T/#m0a18615b7f96af4c21a5ce4207b435a6c476a1f1)).\n\nCory Fields reports on Hennadii Stepanov's effort to transition Bitcoin Core's build system from Autotools to CMake, aiming for integration after the v28 feature-freeze. This change, expected to streamline the development process and encourage community feedback, highlights the development team's preference for modernizing the project's infrastructure while maintaining support for older branches. The adoption of CMake reflects a broader strategy to enhance Bitcoin Core's build efficiency and developer experience, with the community encouraged to participate in the transition ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/6cfd5a56-84b4-4cbc-a211-dd34b8942f77n@googlegroups.com/T/#u#m4526371f167fea9fe6a681f529d7ac400cb35906)).\n\nDiscussions around the mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DoS) threats through onion messages in Bitcoin's network and the vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency wallets' user interface designs were also prominent. The former addresses the lack of formal analysis on DoS risks but notes the implementation of a \"backpressure\" mitigation strategy. In contrast, the latter conversation explores the risks and design considerations in associating contact information with payment codes, emphasizing the need for clear communication and secure practices to prevent deceptive practices and ensure transaction security ([source 1](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/onion-messaging-dos-threat-mitigations/1058/2), [source 2](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bolt-12-trusted-contacts/1046/5))",
