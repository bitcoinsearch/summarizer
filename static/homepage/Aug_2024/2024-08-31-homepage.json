    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announced the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.0rc1, a significant update aimed at enhancing the software's functionality and security. This release candidate allows users to trial the new version and contribute feedback for final adjustments before its official release, with detailed insights and preliminary notes accessible for review ([Bitcoin Core Release Candidate Information](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/test.rc1/)).\n\nAntoine Riard proposed the establishment of \"free-to-pwn\" lightning nodes on the mainnet to facilitate real-world testing of sophisticated cross-layer attacks, such as pinning. This initiative seeks to improve the Bitcoin ecosystem by demonstrating vulnerabilities under actual operating conditions, encouraging a broader discussion on security and the robustness of the network ([Linux Foundation Mailing List Archive](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-May/018925.html)).\n\nDiscussion led by Antoine Riard and victorkstarkware explored advancements and challenges in Bitcoin's computational capabilities and transaction security. They delved into the potential of re-enabling OP_CAT for general computation on Bitcoin and addressed concerns over transaction vulnerabilities like replacement cycling attacks. These conversations highlight ongoing efforts to enhance Bitcoin's security and versatility, with significant contributions from the community towards developing solutions ([Bitcoin Wildlife Sanctuary](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Wildlife-Sanctuary)).\n\nFi3 introduced an SV2 extension proposal aimed at improving transparency and fairness in mining pool payouts, enabling miners to have greater control over selecting transactions. This development represents a step forward in refining the operational framework of mining pools, with the project actively seeking community feedback to perfect the system ([PPLNS with Job Declaration](https://github.com/demand-open-source/pplns-with-job-declaration/blob/bd7258db08e843a5d3732bec225644eda6923e48/pplns-with-job-declaration.pdf)).",
