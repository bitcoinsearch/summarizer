    "header_summary": "Hennadii Stepanov's transition of Bitcoin Core's build system from Autotools to CMake signifies a major enhancement, aiming for integration after version 28's feature-freeze, as highlighted by Cory Fields. This move, expected to streamline development and address potential platform-specific challenges, underscores the value of community feedback during the transition phase. The change, driven by the benefits CMake offers to modern open-source projects, along with thorough documentation updates, facilitates developer adaptation and promises future improvements for broader support and usability ([Bitcoin Core CMake migration](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30454)).\n\nZawy discusses the potential for enhancing blockchain security through adjustments in consensus rules and timestamp handling, focusing on preventing attacks that exploit difficulty adjustments. Proposing the adoption of monotonic timestamps and revisiting the limits on 'nActualtimespan', the conversation aims to fortify the blockchain against manipulation without extensive code modifications. This initiative reflects a nuanced approach to maintaining network integrity and underscores the ongoing need for revising consensus mechanisms to mitigate emerging threats, as evidenced in the related [discussion on timestamp attacks](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/zawy-s-alternating-timestamp-attack/1062/2).\n\nMattCorallo and t-bast explore vulnerabilities in different aspects of blockchain technology, from potential Distributed Denial of Service (DoS) threats in onion messaging to security and user interface design considerations in cryptocurrency wallets. While Corallos highlights the absence of a formal risk analysis for DoS via onion messages and discusses a \"backpressure\" mitigation strategy, t-bast delves into the risks associated with compromised contact keys in wallets, emphasizing the importance of clear and secure design in preventing deceptive practices. These discussions collectively underscore the complexity of securing blockchain technology and the importance of proactive, informed strategies for threat mitigation ([Onion messaging DoS threat mitigations](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/onion-messaging-dos-threat-mitigations/1058/2); [BOLT 12 trusted contacts](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bolt-12-trusted-contacts/1046/5)).",
