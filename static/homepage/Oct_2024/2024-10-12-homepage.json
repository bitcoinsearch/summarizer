    "header_summary": "AdamISZ/waxwing's [Reyify blog post](https://reyify.com/blog/adaptors-generalised/) delves into the potential of adaptor signatures to extend beyond their conventional scope, specifically exploring their application in Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) constructions and on-chain verification for statements outside the secp256k1 generator G. This exploration includes a theoretical discussion on multi-base single statements and a practical approach toward embedding curve points within transaction messages to facilitate BIP340 signatures that could verify Discrete Logarithm Equality (DLEQ) relationships on-chain.\n\nAriard addresses a significant bug in Bitcoin's script execution related to the handling of `scriptCode` containing ECDSA signatures and \"noise\" data by consensus nodes, highlighting the issue's complexity and potential to affect network integrity and consensus through script manipulation. This discussion underscores the sophistication of Bitcoin's script execution mechanism and points towards the necessity for updated node versions to maintain network consistency, as detailed in the public disclosure on [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cve-2024-38365-public-disclosure-btcd-findanddelete-bug/1184/4).\n\nThe release of Bitcoin Inquisition 28.0 introduces crucial protocol enhancements and consensus changes, as outlined by ajtowns, including support for TRUC, anchor relay mechanisms, and significant BIP implementations aimed at improving Bitcoin's flexibility and security. The update, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/releases/tag/v28.0-inq), signifies a step forward in Bitcoin's ongoing evolution, offering advanced functionalities and furthering consensus changes to enhance user experience and network integrity.\n\nMishaKomarov\u2019s introduction of Bitcoin PIPEs (Polynomial Inner Product Encryption) presents an innovative approach to implementing covenants in Bitcoin without necessitating a soft fork, thereby unlocking new use cases and enhancing Bitcoin's scalability, performance, and programmability. This breakthrough, detailed on [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-pipes-introducting-covenants-without-soft-forks/1183), leverages cryptographic methods to facilitate complex transaction conditions and scalable cryptographic proofs, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, without altering Bitcoin's core protocol, thus expanding its functional capabilities while upholding security and simplicity.",
