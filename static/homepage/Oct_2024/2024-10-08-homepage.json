    "header_summary": "Dr. Craig S. Wrong's Swift Bitcoin project, detailed on [GitHub](https://github.com/swift-bitcoin/swift-bitcoin) and its [website](https://swift-bitcoin.github.io), marks a significant contribution to understanding Bitcoin's mechanics through the Swift programming language. It encompasses a comprehensive suite of Swift APIs covering various functionalities from cryptography to transaction verification, aiming for data race safety and non-blocking operations facilitated by SwiftNIO. The project's independence from third-party libraries promises compact binaries, with a focus on Apple platform compatibility, though development and testing primarily occur on Linux to ensure broad applicability.\n\nAva Chow announces the release of Bitcoin Core version 28.0, available for download at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/), which introduces new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements with confirmed compatibility across multiple operating systems. This version emphasizes improvements in network efficiency, fee estimation, wallet functionality, and security measures, including XOR'd block files and optimized chainstate database flushing to speed up initial block downloads. Contributions from the community continue to evolve Bitcoin Core into a more robust digital currency platform.\n\nMishaKomarov introduces Bitcoin PIPEs (Polynomial Inner Product Encryption) at [DelvingBitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-pipes-introducting-covenants-without-soft-forks/1183), a novel approach enabling covenants in Bitcoin without requiring a soft fork. This cryptographic method allows for advanced spending rules and new use cases like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and token creation, enhancing Bitcoin's scalability and performance while preserving its core protocol. The architecture minimizes trust assumptions through a one-time trusted setup, making it a significant advancement in Bitcoin's development for complex, secure transactions without consensus changes.\n\nThe integration of Plotly.js in a Discourse theme component, as discussed by ajtowns, facilitates advanced data visualization within forums, offering interactive graphing capabilities without external tools. This development, documented at [DelvingBitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/support-for-graphing-data/1180), allows users to engage with complex data representations, including geographical data and customizable visual elements. Plotly's broad functionality for creating diverse charts and graphs underscores its utility in enhancing user interaction and content richness on discussion platforms.",
