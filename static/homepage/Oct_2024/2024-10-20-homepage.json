    "header_summary": "Andrew Toth's proposal for enhancing the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format, specifically through Version 2 as detailed in BIP 370, focuses on integrating silent payments to improve privacy in transactions. This method alters how transaction outputs are computed and verified, requiring additional data fields and modifying participant roles, such as Constructor, Signer, and Extractor, to support the generation and validation of silent payment outputs using cryptographic proofs ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/cde77c84-b576-4d66-aa80-efaf4e50468fn@googlegroups.com/T/#u#ma28015d36d7afba0a7738d191ef1d63074a9b25f)).\n\nEllemouton's discussion highlights proposed updates to the current protocol to enhance information exchange and transaction verification within the network. These updates include transitioning to a Pure Type-Length-Value (TLV) format for message structures, using Schnorr signatures for Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) channel announcements, and introducing optional fields like Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs to improve network efficiency and scalability. The phased rollout of these changes is signaled by new feature bits, indicating a node's capabilities and fostering adaptability ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/updates-to-the-gossip-1-75-proposal-post-ln-summit-meeting/1202)).\n\nAccumulator introduces \"Bundled Payments\" to the BOLT12 specification, aiming to facilitate non-custodian exchanges by allowing an invoice to include multiple preimages and amounts. This concept is especially relevant for submarine swaps and Just-In-Time (JIT) channels, enhancing transaction efficiency and security in the blockchain ecosystem. Detailed discussions and technical specifications provided in the Linux Foundation's mailing list serve as resources for implementing this feature ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/expanding-on-bolt12/1167/4)).\n\nAriard clarifies the operation of `FindAndDelete` in Bitcoin scripting, emphasizing that it modifies a copy of the script for sighash commitment without altering the original script execution. The discussion corrects misconceptions about the extent of data push removal by `FindAndDelete` and its counterpart `removeOpcodeByData`, highlighting the complexity and nuanced insights into the functionality and implications of `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in certain contexts ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cve-2024-38365-public-disclosure-btcd-findanddelete-bug/1184/10)).",
