    "header_summary": "Bitcoin Core version 28.0 has been released, featuring enhancements in Testnet4/BIP94 support, JSON-RPC 2.0, wallet functionality including a `max_tx_weight` option and a `createwalletdescriptor` RPC, alongside improvements in network efficiency and fee estimation. This update, available for download at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/), also brings significant changes such as the removal of the libbitcoin-consensus library, adjustments to P2P and Tor connection handling, and GUI updates aimed at bolstering security, usability, and performance. Notably, it supports upgrades from versions at their end of life for users on Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, Windows 7 or newer, and most UNIX-like systems, with certain system changes enhancing the initial block download times by optimizing the chainstate database flushing process during block pruning.\n\nIn another development, the integration of Plotly.js within a Discourse theme component marks a significant advancement in embedding interactive data visualizations directly into forums or discussion platforms. This tool enables the creation of detailed XY plots and more complex visualizations, such as great circles on world maps, through simple text markup, facilitating sophisticated data representation without external image generation. The component, detailed at [GitHub](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/support-for-graphing-data/1180) and supported by extensive documentation from [Plotly's official website](https://plotly.com/javascript/), offers features like zoom, pan, and hover information, enhancing user interaction with graphed data. This development underscores the potential of integrating advanced graphing capabilities in enhancing the analytical depth of discussions in online communities.",
