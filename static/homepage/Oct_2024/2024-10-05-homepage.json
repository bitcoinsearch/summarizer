    "header_summary": "Ava Chow announces the release of Bitcoin Core version 28.0, highlighting its new features, bug fixes, performance enhancements, and broader OS compatibility, including Testnet4/BIP94 support and improved wallet functionality. This version introduces significant updates aimed at enhancing network efficiency, wallet management, and system security, with contributions from a diverse group of developers ([Bitcoin Core 28.0 Release](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/)).\n\nKeagan McClelland discusses the challenges and solutions related to handling dust outputs in cryptocurrency transactions, emphasizing wallet policy adaptations to improve the user experience and technical efficiency without needing blockchain protocol changes. This conversation underlines the importance of application-level strategies in addressing issues like dust outputs by potentially converting them into additional transaction fees, thereby benefiting both users and miners ([Handling of Dust Outputs in Cryptocurrency Transactions](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALeFGL0ddgS=qCsunoGwD2j6By4_bQpndX-oKn_wAQse3o+Sxg@mail.gmail.com/T/#m9a9ef4bd1e7a6795ec3c2abc18650a8b0ca2f292)).\n\nAjtowns introduces the integration of Plotly.js for advanced graphing capabilities within Discourse forums, enabling interactive data visualization. This development allows forum users to engage more deeply with data through features like zoom, pan, and hover for details, showcasing the potential for complex visualizations, including geographical data representation ([Plotly.js Integration for Discourse](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/support-for-graphing-data/1180)).\n\nAndyschroder differentiates a new proposal as more suitable for a bLIP rather than an amendment to BOLT specifications, ensuring the optional incorporation of trusted contacts within BOLT12's framework. This distinction emphasizes maintaining the standard functionality for users not adopting the proposal while exploring its potential to enhance BOLT12's features without foundational disruption ([Proposal for BOLT12 Trusted Contacts](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/expanding-on-bolt12/1167/2)).",
