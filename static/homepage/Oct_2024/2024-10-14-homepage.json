    "header_summary": "AdamISZ/waxwing's blog post on [Reyify](https://reyify.com/blog/adaptors-generalised/) explores the potential of adaptor signatures in cryptographic protocols, particularly their application in verifying Discrete Logarithm Equality (DLEQ) statements through a proposed two-party protocol. This exploration includes theoretical aspects of multi-base single statements and practical applications that could enhance on-chain verification capabilities, suggesting a broader utility for adaptor signatures beyond current limitations.\n\nAntoineP highlights the complexities of achieving a chain fork through specific operational codes and the necessity of public key recovery in this process, focusing on the challenges posed by mutual commitments between the signature and `scriptCode`. The discussion raises questions about alternative methods for chain forking without public key recovery, hinting at potential innovations in the execution of chain forks [source URL](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/cve-2024-38365-public-disclosure-btcd-findanddelete-bug/1184/5).\n\nThe release of Bitcoin Inquisition 28.0 introduces significant enhancements and proposed consensus changes, including support for TRUC, anchor relay mechanisms, and several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) aimed at improving protocol flexibility and security. This version, building upon [Bitcoin Core 28.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/28.0/), signifies a continuing evolution of Bitcoin with advanced functionalities designed to enhance user experience and network integrity, as detailed in the [announcement](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-inquisition-28-0/1187).\n\nLastly, MishaKomarov presents Bitcoin PIPEs as a novel approach to implementing covenants on Bitcoin without necessitating soft forks, enabling advanced spending rules and new use cases such as native verification of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and the creation of native tokens. This significant innovation, outlined in the [discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-pipes-introducting-covenants-without-soft-forks/1183), leverages Polynomial Inner Product Encryption to emulate missing opcodes and facilitate complex transaction conditions, thereby enhancing Bitcoin's scalability, performance, and programmability without altering its core protocol.",
