    "header_summary": "The release of Bitcoin Core version 30.0 introduces a suite of new features, bug fixes, performance enhancements, and updated translations, emphasizing security with the end of maintenance for versions 27.x and older. Significant updates include policy adjustments such as a limit on legacy signature operations and an increase in the data carrier size for OP_RETURN outputs, alongside improvements in network and mempool management to bolster against denial-of-service attacks. The upgrade also introduces a unified `bitcoin` command line tool and reinstates support for external signing on Windows, among other refinements aimed at improving user accessibility and interaction with the software. For more details and to download the new version, users can visit [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.0/).\n\nIn parallel, Bitcoin Guard is unveiled as a novel security measure designed to protect Bitcoin users from physical attacks by increasing the risk for attackers and reducing potential rewards. This project introduces a lightweight signaling protocol within a Bitcoin address that allows users to lock their wallets in an emergency, effectively preventing unauthorized transactions. Bitcoin Guard's comprehensive approach includes mobile and desktop applications, integration with third-party services for emergency alerts, and detailed technical specifications available for review [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/introducing-bitcoin-guard/2049).\n\nOn another front, B-SSL emerges as an innovative system aimed at advancing Bitcoin security and management, addressing the critical issue of potential key loss in non-custodial wallets. The B-SSL framework proposes a dual-component solution catering to both institutions and individual users, featuring joint custody coordination and a sovereign vault with human fail-safes. This system seeks to enhance the safety and usability of digital currency storage and transactions, representing a significant step forward in cryptocurrency wallet design and management. Further discussion and technical details on B-SSL can be accessed [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/concept-review-b-ssl-bitcoin-secure-signing-layer-covenant-free-vault-model-using-taproot-csv-and-cltv/2047/3).",
