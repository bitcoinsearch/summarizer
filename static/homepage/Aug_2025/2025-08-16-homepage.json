    "header_summary": "In an analysis by Anthony Towns, the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository experienced a notable increase in activity following the introduction of new editors, highlighting the critical role of editor contributions in enhancing the repository's productivity. Jon Atack and Murch were identified as particularly active contributors during 2024 and 2025, emphasizing the importance of managing editorial roles to prevent burnout and ensure efficiency. The suggestion includes implementing term limits for editors and introducing an \"apprenticeship\" role to facilitate the involvement of new volunteers, aiming to maintain the vitality of the BIPs repository ([Source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/aJrSEOImKAa9NEB9@erisian.com.au/T/#m4294d050022bdd4c1c681ade3de7b3605d83be1a)).\n\nConduition criticized a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal aimed at mitigating quantum computing threats to Bitcoin, arguing that it relies too heavily on centralized, legalistic solutions such as KYC procedures, which contradict Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. Instead, the correspondence advocates for a shift towards fostering a culture of cooperation among potential quantum adversaries and establishing ethical guidelines for entities with advanced quantum capabilities ([Source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/SN6PR12MB2735280A252DD62231D1320AA523A@SN6PR12MB2735.namprd12.prod.outlook.com/T/#m5f7fc61258555e97ea16fd419d3a7a00149ddb7c)).\n\nGmaxwell's exploration into the use of Minisketch for block relay processes highlights the efficiency of reconciling announcements over full mempool reconciliation, presenting a strategy that aligns bandwidth and decoding costs more closely. The discussion also considers future-oriented approaches like maintaining clones of peers' mempools to minimize block propagation delays, promising expedited block relay through highly efficient means while keeping memory usage minimal ([Source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/sharing-block-templates/1906/8)).\n\nVigSeth proposed the development of a high-performance Layer 1 protocol, the \"Twinstor Blockchain,\" utilizing a Proof of Useful Work consensus mechanism focused on matrix multiplication to support digital twin technologies across various industries. This initiative aims for an initial transaction throughput of over 1000 TPS, indicating a significant step towards scalability and performance in blockchain technology, with a whitepaper available for further details ([Whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xqfk99fbXz5ZSGiVSHeVhJi1bEUgCWuU/view?usp=sharing)).",
