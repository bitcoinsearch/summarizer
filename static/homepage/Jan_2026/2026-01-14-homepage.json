    "header_summary": "The Quantum\u2011Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) introduces a novel approach to enhance post-quantum security by quarantining legacy Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) through a two-phase commit and spend flow. This method, detailed with a [design note](https://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.md) and [diagram](https://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.svg), aims to prevent destination substitution attacks, ensuring that legacy UTXOs remain spendable while mitigating potential security vulnerabilities. The proposal also includes user experience considerations, such as fee sponsorship and off-chain commitment authorization, addressing practical and technical challenges in its implementation.\n\nThe release of Bitcoin Core v30.2, as announced on the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.2/), brings significant upgrades including new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Highlighting the collaborative effort behind this release, contributors such as Ava Chow, brunoerg, and others are acknowledged, though an oversight excluded jestory and davidgumberg from the credits despite their crucial contributions, spotlighting the need for a more inclusive acknowledgment system for all forms of contribution.\n\nHornet UTXO(1) represents a significant advancement in Bitcoin client technology, as part of the Hornet Node project aiming for high-performance consensus validation. This lock-free, highly concurrent UTXO database, capable of revalidating the entire mainnet chain significantly faster than Bitcoin Core, is detailed in T. Sharp's \"Hornet Node: A Declarative, Executable Specification of Bitcoin Consensus,\" available in [HTML](https://hornetnode.org/paper.html) and [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15754) formats. The project invites feedback and collaboration to further develop this efficient consensus validation mechanism.\n\nLastly, a collaborative potential is highlighted between Bithoven's work and a project focused on formalizing state-bound assets on Bitcoin through the 'W' protocol. This collaboration could leverage Bithoven\u2019s static analyzer to address challenges related to Schnorr Introspection and MAST-binding covenants, as detailed in the [OPI-003 document](https://github.com/The-Universal-BRC-20-Extension/OPI/blob/19f9ab66ebbda1a4b210d7b110ba2af506c1/OPI/OPI-003-W.md), suggesting a synergistic approach to advancing Bitcoin's capabilities in handling state-bound assets.",
