    "header_summary": "During the IRC meeting on December 18, 2025, a consensus was reached on employing BIP 9 with conservative parameters for the activation of BIP 119, reflecting the Bitcoin development community's careful and inclusive approach to protocol enhancements. This decision and its activation parameters are documented for community review at [https://ctv-activation.github.io/](https://ctv-activation.github.io/).\n\nEthan Heilman, Isabel Foxen Duke, and colleagues have initiated a major rewrite of BIP 360, aiming to address quantum computing threats to Bitcoin without incorporating post-quantum signature schemes. Instead, the proposal introduces \"Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH),\" enhancing security by omitting key path spend features and is open for community feedback at [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1670) and [BIP360.org](http://bip360.org).\n\nFurthermore, discussions in the Bitcoin Development Mailing List have illuminated the rigorous scrutiny and innovative experimentation within the community regarding new opcodes and Bitcoin's scripting capabilities, aiming to balance innovation with network integrity. In contrast, debates around platforms like BMAX and Hashpool underline the economic and technological nuances in blockchain and mining sectors, emphasizing the importance of internal network observations and the valuation of probabilistic future mining shares.\n\nLastly, a sophisticated method combining OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (OP_CTV) and OP_TXHASH/OP_CHECKTXHASHVERIFY protocols has been proposed to secure Bitcoin transactions against quantum attacks, illustrating a multi-phase strategy to enhance security without compromising flexibility or requiring historical transaction indices, further detailed at [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/earonesty/ea086aa995be1a860af093f93bd45bf2). This discussion, alongside advice against using floating-point numbers for financial calculations to avoid rounding errors, highlights ongoing efforts to refine Bitcoin's security and functionality in the face of advancing cryptographic threats and technological developments.",
