    <summary>I apologize for the confusion. Here is a detailed summary of the provided context:The discussion revolves around various aspects of the timestop feature in Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Christopher Jamthagen expresses concern about the potential vulnerability of the network to a DoS attack if the timestop feature is activated only when the CLTV transaction is included in a block. Rusty Russell counters this by suggesting that "time doesn't pass if a block is full," but clarifies that the CLTV block time and real block time would diverge by 1 block / ~10 minutes every time a block is full. He proposes explicitly supplying the block-height at which the transaction including the CLTV was signed as a solution.The conversation also touches upon the scalability of outsourcability and the possibility of automating fees in the "steal" transaction. However, concerns are raised about remembering R values and timeouts. It is mentioned that watching the blockchain for spends on anchor outputs would only require work when one of them gets spent, which should rarely happen since the client should inform the third party about cooperative channel closures.In another discussion, Eric Lombrozo and Christopher Jamthagen discuss the idea of a third-party notification system for detecting stealing transactions in the Lightning Network. Lombrozo suggests that once he is notified, he could sign the stealing transaction and take all the money himself. However, a challenge is presented regarding proving that the watcher notified the user of the stealing transaction. Rusty suggests an alternative approach of paying a small amount in advance every month instead of relying solely on the watcher's notification. He mentions the existence of clever people designing a micropayment network that could be used for this purpose.The email exchanges also touch upon the need for a new sighash op mode or normalized txids for outsourcing in the Lightning Network. It is mentioned that implementing a deployable system around outsourcing is not feasible currently due to this limitation. The group discusses the difficulties associated with pre-signing stealing transactions and finding a clever solution to overcome them.Overall, the discussions highlight various challenges and potential solutions related to the timestop feature, outsourcability, third-party notification systems, and stealing transactions in the Lightning Network.</summary>
