    <summary>The article delves into the effects of Byzantine nodes on payment channels and transactions. It explains that in a channel mechanism involving only two nodes, a Byzantine fault is impossible to occur. However, in multi-hop forwarding mechanisms, where a hop node is involved in a payment attempt, there are three participants: the hop node itself, the incoming node, and the outgoing node. The article thoroughly examines each case and its implications for payments.When considering the impact of two Byzantine nodes opening a payment channel, the article asserts that these two nodes would essentially be indistinguishable from a single node that has channels with both of them. As a result, the aggregate of these two nodes would possess all the money in that payment channel. This scenario is akin to the aggregate "HODLing" its funds in a hot wallet. Consequently, the actions or games played by the aggregate of both nodes with the money it exclusively owns are inconsequential to the rest of the network.The author poses a question regarding the effect of Byzantine nodes on protocols, specifically in the context of payment channels. They seek literature that addresses this issue. The concern lies in the possibility that if two Byzantine nodes open a payment channel and intermediate transactions are not recorded, it may disrupt other transactions routed through the same channel.In conclusion, the article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Byzantine nodes on payment channels and transactions. It explores the scenarios involving two Byzantine nodes and highlights the negligible influence their actions have on the overall network. The author also raises concerns about the potential consequences of unrecorded intermediate transactions in such channels.</summary>
