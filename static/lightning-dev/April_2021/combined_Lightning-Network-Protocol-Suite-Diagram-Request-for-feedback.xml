    <summary>The authors of the book "Mastering the Lightning Network," including Andreas, Roasbeef, and Rene, have been working diligently on their project for the past 18 months. As part of their progress, they have created a diagram of the Lightning Network Protocol Suite and are seeking feedback and criticism from the community. The diagram, which can be found on Wikimedia Commons, showcases the layers of the protocol suite along with the corresponding boxes and labels used to describe them.One of the main motivations behind creating this diagram is to address the potential confusion that can arise from the intermixing of BOLTs within the protocol. The authors recognize that this complexity can be overwhelming for newcomers, and thus they have decided to create an architecture diagram for the Lightning Network as a way to provide clarity. They hope that by sharing their current diagram with the community, they can gather valuable feedback before incorporating it into the book.Interested individuals can find previous versions of the diagram and follow the authors' discussions on GitHub. However, it should be noted that BOLT 03 and BOLT 5, which pertain to Bitcoin-related aspects, are not currently included in the diagram. Nonetheless, the authors aim to utilize the feedback received to refine the diagram and create a comprehensive resource that aids in understanding the Lightning Network.</summary>
