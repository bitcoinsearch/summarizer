    <summary>Carla Kirk-Cohen started the email thread by addressing technical issues with the recording of Monday's call and requested attendees to provide any missed information. The details for the next call, including the date, time, link, and agenda, were shared. Additionally, there was a suggestion to create a public Google Calendar or shared calendar for better organization.The discussion then shifted towards the ongoing effort to define a standard for Lightning Network metrics, which began over a year ago. Vincent mentioned the basic idea of collecting data from different nodes and analyzing them before defining any protocol support via BOLT or BLIPS. It was suggested that different types of nodes may require different metrics and reputation. Some data, such as forwarding payment scoring by channels and node uptime, is already accessible through a public API at https://api.lnmetrics.info. The source code for this project can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/LNOpenMetrics.During Monday's call, participants discussed "proof of forwarding" schemes and the challenges associated with upfront fees and differential rates. They considered a scenario where nodes collaborate to forward a payment despite having proof of forward. The group also explored the use of upfront fees combined with attributable errors to penalize nodes that steal upfront fees instead of forwarding HTLC. This discussion included experimenting with circuit breakers in the context of local reputation or HTLC endorsement, as well as automating decision-making for end users. However, it was noted that implementing these solutions would require wider adoption and changes to surface TLVs on the interceptor API.The complexity of jamming mitigation was acknowledged, and the group questioned whether these imperfect solutions are worth pursuing. The next call is scheduled for February 20th at 18:00 UTC on https://meet.jit.si/UnjammingLN, and the agenda is available at https://github.com/ClaraShk/LNJamming/issues/3.Overall, the email thread covered discussions on technical issues with call recordings, the suggestion of creating a public Google Calendar or shared calendar, ongoing efforts to define Lightning Network metrics, and the exploration of "proof of forwarding" schemes and challenges related to upfront fees and differential rates. The complexity of jamming mitigation and the next call details were also mentioned.</summary>
