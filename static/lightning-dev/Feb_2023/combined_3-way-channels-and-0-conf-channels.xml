    <summary>The context provided discusses the use of the Lightning Network (LN) as an anti-spam, anti-sybil rate limiting scheme for a peer-to-peer network system. The first part focuses on the use case of Indranet, where small payments of hundreds of sats are transported using LN. The LN instance is integrated with the Indra service and requires three optimal channels between relays to ensure message layers include special nodes called "seeds." These seeds allow clients to open zero conf, one-way channels for very small balances. The intention is to have a vast LN mesh with all nodes having at least three peers with channels to them. Payments between peers need to be low latency and do not include fees for simplified route selection.The second part of the context addresses the issue of input being signed by one participant, who can sign a different transaction that spends the input differently and bribe a miner to include it in a mined block. While this problem cannot be entirely resolved, some confirmed transaction is required to commit funds to the three participants. The author, ZmnSCPxj, signs a message that includes public key and digital signature attachments to address this issue.Furthermore, the discussion explores the use of LN as an anti-spam and anti-sybil rate limiting scheme in a separate peer-to-peer network system. This application could be relevant for various monetized p2p networks where users can anonymously pay other relays to host and deliver content for designated user identities. It also enables this to become a distributed service rather than relying on the trustworthiness of relays.The author emphasizes the advantages of having three-node channels in the LN. These advantages include the ability to advertise which node has the lowest balance, helping with channel balance and overall liquidity. Additionally, a node with three channels attached to it can route to ten different next hops for only three opening transaction fees. The lowest balance in the channel can be publicly broadcasted as a one-bit boolean value, simplifying pathfinding. However, there is a drawback to having more than two participants in an offchain updateable cryptocurrency system, as the system cannot update if any participant is offline. Furthermore, some confirmed transaction is still required to commit funds, and everyone has to wait for that transaction to confirm, meaning the confirmation-or-trust requirement cannot be sidestepped.In conclusion, the context provides insights into using the Lightning Network as an anti-spam, anti-sybil rate limiting scheme in a peer-to-peer network system. It discusses the use case of Indranet, the issue of input signing, and explores the potential applications of LN in various monetized p2p networks. The advantages of three-node channels are highlighted, along with the limitations of having more than two participants in an offchain updateable cryptocurrency system.</summary>
