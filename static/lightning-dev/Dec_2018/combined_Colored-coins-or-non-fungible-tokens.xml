    <summary>Rene informed Joao about BHB Networks, a company working on colored coins for Bitcoin and Lightning. The main contributor to this project is Alekos Filini. The progress of the project can be found in their spec repository on GitHub, specifically in the fourth markdown file which focuses on the lightning network.Alekos has presented about this project at both the third lightning hackday in Berlin and the LightningHackdayNYC. Recordings of both talks are available on YouTube, providing further information about the project's goals and developments.In a forum post, an author expressed their appreciation for the work done on the Lightning Network and raised the question of whether there had been any discussions about exchanging colored-coins or non-fungible tokens through the LN. The author acknowledged that while issuance might not currently be possible, surprises can happen in this space and suggested that adding these capabilities to the LN could open up new use-cases.Given the interest in exchanging colored-coins and non-fungible tokens, Rene suggested that Joao reach out directly to Alekos to discuss this topic further.</summary>
