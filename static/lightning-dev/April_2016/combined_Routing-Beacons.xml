    <summary>The inquiry made by Laurentmt is focused on the concept of routing based on beacons in the Lightning Network (LN). The main idea behind this approach is to establish routes by utilizing a known set of landmark nodes. This can be achieved through various methods.The node is specifically interested in finding the most cost-effective route to and from each beacon node. To ensure that this information is easily disseminated, the best-known route can be broadcasted. However, determining the "cheapest" route depends on the specific amount being transmitted, as rates are expressed as "base + per-satoshi-amount". Therefore, certain heuristics will need to be implemented to determine the best option.In addition to this inquiry, a LN newcomer is also seeking information on the use of routing based on beacons. The user is curious to know if this approach is similar to the Pulse Protocol, which involves periodically computing spanning trees with beacon nodes as the root.Overall, both inquiries center around the idea of utilizing beacons for routing within the LN. While Laurentmt is interested in finding the most cost-effective routes, the LN newcomer is curious about potential similarities to the Pulse Protocol's use of beacon nodes as roots for spanning trees.</summary>
