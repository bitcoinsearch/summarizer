    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Lightning-dev mailing list, the topic of wumbo channels and payments was brought up. It was proposed that wumbo channels should also allow for wumbo payments, as it would be counterproductive to have large capacity channels that cannot handle larger payments. The suggestion was made that if the wumbo bit is signaled globally, it should also indicate the willingness of nodes to forward larger payments up to their max_htlc limit within the channel_update for that link.However, an inconsistency in the newer section of the spec concerning the optional max_htlc value was pointed out by Laolu. The spec states that the value should be below the max capacity of the channel but does not make reference to the current pre-wumbo max HTLC limit. This could potentially lead to confusion, as signaling the optional field may be interpreted as eligibility to route wumbo payments in a pre-wumbo channel world.ZmnSCPxj suggested a solution to address this issue by introducing two feature bits to the Lightning Network protocol. The first feature bit, `option_i_wumbo_you_wumbo`, would indicate that a node is willing to "wumbo" with its counterpart in a connection. The second feature bit, `option_anyone_can_wumbo`, would indicate that the node is willing to wumbo with any other node. This proposal aims to ensure that wumbo channels and payments are properly implemented and to address any inconsistencies in the spec.Rusty Russell chimed in with a suggestion to rename the `option_anyone_can_wumbo` feature bit to `option_wumborama`. This renaming would provide a clearer indication of the willingness to engage in wumbo transactions.Overall, the discussion focused on how to ensure the proper implementation of wumbo channels and payments and how to address any inconsistencies in the specification. The proposed solutions aim to clarify the signaling of wumbo capabilities and improve the functionality of the Lightning Network.</summary>
