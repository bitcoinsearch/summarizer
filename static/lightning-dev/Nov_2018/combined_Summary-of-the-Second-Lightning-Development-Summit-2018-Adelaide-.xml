    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of the made-up word 'wumbo' and whether it should follow typical grammar rules or have its own grammar. The question arises if imposing normal grammar on a made-up word is necessary. The concern is that if we limit ourselves to traditional grammar, it may restrict our ability to define novel grammar for made-up words in the future. However, it is suggested that we should not create our own grammar without ensuring that it is understandable.The context provided is a statement that reads "I wumbo, you wumbo, he wumbo she wumbo". However, a person disagrees with the statement and thinks it should be "he wumboes, she wumboes". There is no further information or explanation given regarding the meaning or context of these statements.Moving on to another topic, the Lightning Specification 1.1 was recently kicked off by the 18 most active spec contributors who met in Adelaide. This meeting resulted in 30 accepted changes for the next version. These changes include multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. Wumbo is the study of all things wumbological, which is a term used to mean "maxi" or removing the channel capacity limit. Hidden destinations refer to rendezvous routing, as explained in the Rendez-vous Routing thread by CJP on the list and the discussion on thread "Link-level payment splitting via intermediary rendezvous nodes" on the list. The work points have been transferred to the Wiki where further discussion can take place.It is worth noting that two years ago, a group of Lightning implementers met in Milan to start the Lightning Specification 1.0. Last week, the 18 most active spec contributors gathered in Adelaide to kick off version 1.1. After two days of discussion, they emerged with 30 accepted changes for the next version. These changes include multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and many gossip improvements. The work points have been transferred to the Wiki, allowing interested people to join in the continuing discussion. In response to the updates, Cezary Dziemian expressed excitement about dual-funded channels but requested Rusty Russell to explain or provide links for "Wumbo" and "hidden destinations".Overall, the Lightning Specification 1.1 has seen significant progress with the acceptance of 30 changes for the next version. These changes cover various aspects, including multi-path payments, dual-funded channels, splicing, wumbo, hidden destinations, and gossip improvements. The contributors have transferred their work points to the Wiki, enabling further refinement and discussion. The gathering of spec contributors in Adelaide was a productive event, where difficult questions were addressed and valuable expertise was shared. A group photo was taken to commemorate the occasion, highlighting the collaboration and dedication of the participants.</summary>
