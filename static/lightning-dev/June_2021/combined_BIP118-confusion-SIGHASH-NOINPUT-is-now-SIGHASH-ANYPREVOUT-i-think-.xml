    <summary>Ryan Grant has highlighted the confusion surrounding the latest updates to the bip118 draft. It should be noted that significant changes have been made to the draft since May 2019, leading to its official name being changed to SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. These changes are discussed in detail under the "Revisions" section of the document. However, the version of the draft in bitcoin/bips remained unchanged until recently, when a minor fix was implemented. This updated version now aligns with the use of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT.The activation of taproot brings forth the preference for using SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT in order to facilitate the requirements of the lightning network client state. Despite these important updates and their potential benefits, Ryan Grant expresses his confusion as to why the wider audience has not yet considered the updated draft of bip118.
