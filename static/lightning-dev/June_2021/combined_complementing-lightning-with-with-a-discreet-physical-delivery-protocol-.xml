    <summary>The email thread discusses the use of Lightning Network's features, including hodl invoices and payment points, to create a network for physical item delivery. The sender explores the possibility of mapping a vending machine into the courier role and discusses concerns around extending this to a multi-courier situation and hodl invoices. They also raise the issue of "time preference liquidity" in the network and suggest that moving to payment points instead of HTLCs can potentially address this concern. The receiver responds by stating that proposed solutions to the hodl-payment-problem do not require payment points but should still be compatible with them. They explain that payment points involve holding PTLCs for long periods of time and propose generalized escrow services as an alternative. The sender also asks if there is a way to determine the likelihood of routing a 90-day hodl invoice, to which the receiver suggests that most implementations impose a maximum limit on the timelocks HTLCs passing through them, which is lower than 90 days.A GitHub repository has been created to explore the possibility of using hodl invoices and forthcoming features like payment points or DLCs of Lightning to create a network for physical item delivery. The protocol aims to be robust, reasonably private, and incentive-compatible. The readme file provides an example of how hodl invoices can be used for atomic package delivery. It involves Merchant Mary, Purchaser Paul, and Courier Charlie. Paul generates a preimage and sends the hash to Mary, who creates a hodl invoice with the hash. The invoice includes the cost of shipment quoted by Charlie. Paul pays the invoice, but it cannot be settled until the preimage is revealed. Charlie creates another hodl invoice for delivery costs, delivers the package to Paul, and settles the invoice upon receiving the preimage. The vending machine with Lightning is introduced as a courier, where pregenerated invoices with their hashes are recorded. The payer enters the preimage into the vending machine to validate it and release the item being vended. The author acknowledges the challenges of making the protocol multi-hop and blinding the physical location but believes it is doable.The author shares a repository called discreet-physical-delivery-protocol to gather thoughts on utilizing current and forthcoming features of Lightning to create a network for physical delivery. They discuss the use of hodl invoices for atomic item delivery and acknowledge that these invoices are also considered the primary culprit for some attacks on the network. They question if Lightning in a post-taproot world solves any of these issues. The author provides a scenario where Merchant Mary, Purchaser Paul, and independent Courier Charlie are involved in the delivery process using hodl invoices. They explain the steps involved in generating preimages, creating hodl invoices, paying them, delivering the package, and settling the invoices with the preimage. The author suggests that allowing this process to be multi-hop and blinding the physical location is challenging but feasible. They invite feedback from the community on the protocol.The email sender shares a GitHub repository called discreet-physical-delivery-protocol, which explores the use of Lightning Network's features for physical item delivery. They mention hodl invoices, payment points, and DLCs as potential tools for creating a robust and private network. The sender asks for feedback on whether hodl invoices are still problematic and if Lightning in a post-taproot world can address these issues. They provide an example of atomic package delivery using hodl invoices, involving Merchant Mary, Purchaser Paul, and independent Courier Charlie. The sender also discusses the possibility of mapping a vending machine into the courier role and the challenges of making the protocol multi-hop and blinding the physical location. They welcome input from the community on these types of protocols combining the digital and physical worlds.</summary>
