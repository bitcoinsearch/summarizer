    <summary>The lack of real-world datasets for conducting simulations and experiments on Lightning can be limiting. However, collecting the proposed fields over a long period may potentially lead to re-identification of anonymized channel counterparties based on heuristics correlated with public graph data. Combining datasets from multiple collection points could further allow drawing conclusions on transferred amounts, channel liquidities, and even the payment destination's identity. Trust in the researchers is crucial as surrendering this data requires it. It is recommended to clarify upfront the time-boxed collection period, data storage, and access permissions. Defining the collection period is necessary to avoid incentivizing node operators to store HTLC data long-term.</summary>
