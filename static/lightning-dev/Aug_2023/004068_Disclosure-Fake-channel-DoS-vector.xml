    <summary>In a recent email exchange, Matt expresses his frustration towards Antoine for attempting to speak on behalf of the LDK project despite not having been actively involved in its development for the past few years. Matt requests Antoine to refrain from doing so and reminds him that he was already aware of the fixes mentioned in the email. The tone of the email is direct and assertive, with Matt expressing his desire for Antoine to stop representing the LDK project.</summary>
