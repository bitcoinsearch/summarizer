    <summary>In the email, the sender discusses the design and feasibility of a proposed protocol for multiparty channels. They focus on two specific points from a paper, questioning the practicality and efficiency of the proposed design. The first point raises concerns about the need for "full state updates" in a multiparty channel with random peers, stating that it may be cumbersome and impractical for safe payments. The second point addresses the process of excluding uncooperative peers, highlighting the excessive cost and speed requirements of the proposed three-transaction solution.Based on these observations, the sender argues that the reliance on "partial state updates" in the proposal is not feasible for trustless payments. They suggest that the proposal's requirement for expensive onchain processes in case of uncooperative participants is inferior to existing designs such as channel factories and multiparty channels.However, the sender still appreciates the effort put into the proposal and expresses interest in learning more if there are any overlooked aspects. They also recommend reviewing the work posted by John Law on the Lightning-Dev mailing list, providing a link to a collection and summary of Law's work for reference.Overall, the email evaluates the proposed protocol for multiparty channels, pointing out potential issues and suggesting alternative solutions. While expressing concerns about certain aspects of the proposed design, the sender maintains an open-minded approach, acknowledging the importance of further exploration and research in the field.</summary>
