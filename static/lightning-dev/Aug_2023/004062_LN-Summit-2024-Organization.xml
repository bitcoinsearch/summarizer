    <summary>According to a native Algerian friend, holding a conference in Algeria is not recommended. She strongly advises against it due to several reasons. Firstly, Algeria is not considered a tourist-friendly destination. It is known for its high violence rate and the presence of fundamentalist beliefs among a significant portion of the population. Additionally, Algeria lacks a significant tourism industry.Furthermore, visiting Algeria as a solo female is deemed risky. The friend mentions that obtaining a visa can be quite troublesome. Not only are visas not always granted, but they also require applicants to pre-arrange their travel well in advance of the conference. This can result in additional expenses for attendees. Given these non-trivial visa requirements, the friend suggests ruling out locations with similar restrictions for the majority of attendees.For more information on this topic, you can visit Peter Todd's website at https://petertodd.org.</summary>
