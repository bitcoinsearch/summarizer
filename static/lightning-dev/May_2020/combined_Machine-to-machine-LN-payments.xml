    <summary>In an email conversation, the potential for the Lightning Network to support a use-case involving subscription payments is explored. The proposed scenario entails a user subscribing to a service by opening a channel with it and configuring their LN node to trust invoices from the service. When the subscription needs to be renewed, the service would send an invoice directly to the client's LN node, which would be automatically processed due to the established trust between the two nodes. To cancel the subscription, the user can remove the service's LN node public key from the list of trusted nodes or set limits on payment amounts and frequencies.The email raises two questions regarding this use-case. Firstly, whether it is possible to send invoices solely through the Lightning Network, without the need for external means. It is suggested that TLVs (Type-Length-Value) could be used for invoicing via LN. Secondly, it asks if automatic machine-to-machine payments can be enabled by accepting invoices from trusted nodes. Offers on the mailing list indicate that these use-cases are already supported by the Lightning Network, and that TLVs can indeed be utilized for invoicing. Additionally, it is noted that automatic payments can be facilitated through the acceptance of invoices from trusted nodes.Overall, Eugene is inquiring about the feasibility of using the Lightning Network for subscription-based services, and the email provides insights into the potential implementation and features that can support such use-cases.</summary>
