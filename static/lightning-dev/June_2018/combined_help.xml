    <summary>On June 23, 2018, the Lightning-dev mailing list engaged in various discussions concerning Lightning Network technology. One topic addressed the potential for Second Level Protocols, like the Lightning Network, to be patented by their creators. Praveen Baratam questioned whether it was feasible for authors or inventors to obtain patents for these protocols. Tim Blokdijk responded by explaining that in the EU, mathematical methods and computer programs are not eligible for patents.Another discussion on the mailing list focused on the challenge of selecting efficient intermediate receivers within the Lightning network, given the absence of routing tables in its architecture. Joseph Hoane expressed concerns about this limitation. In response, ZmnSCPxj clarified that the payer relies on their own local view of the network to create a route from payer to payee. This eliminates the need for intermediate nodes to maintain routing tables. Each channel in the payer's view includes a reference to the unspent transaction output (UTXO) backing it, and a signature matching the 2-of-2 multisig is required to prove the existence of these channels.Additionally, Oleg Sadov suggested leveraging OpenFlow technology to manage network configurations. OpenFlow enables the creation of software-defined networks (SDN) where the L7 OSI application layer manages the network configuration with NW packet routing and transparent transformation for sender/receiver pairs. This SDN approach can prove valuable in building SDN-enabled Blockchain modeling NW environments.Overall, the Lightning-dev mailing list serves as a platform for individuals to discuss various topics related to Lightning Network technology.</summary>
