    <summary>A proposal has been made to introduce spontaneous payments within the Lightning network, as outlined in a GitHub issue and a "brain storm" wiki on the Request for Comments repository. Currently, users are required to have an invoice from the receiver in order to make a payment. However, the proposed solution suggests routing the payment directly to the intended recipient's node using a special form of encrypted routing message.This routing message includes a preimage, which can be used by the receiving node to complete or cancel the transaction. Additionally, it may also include other data such as a signed description. If the receiver's node recognizes the format of the message, it can utilize the preimage accordingly. In case unsolicited funds are received, the transaction can be canceled.One of the key advantages of this proposed solution is that it simplifies the routing process compared to the existing "payment to self" method. Furthermore, it enables users to include a small message along with the payment. This protocol ensures the security of funds as none of the intermediate nodes can steal them due to the encryption of the routing data.While it is possible to make spontaneous payments using the current "payment to self" method, the new protocol offers several benefits. It eliminates the need for the second half of the route, making the process more streamlined. Additionally, it allows for the inclusion of a small message, providing users with additional flexibility. Overall, the proposed solution aims to enhance the Lightning network's functionality by enabling spontaneous payments while maintaining security and simplicity.</summary>
