    <summary>A developer named Jozef Hutko recently raised concerns about the lack of mobile lightning wallets that can send satoshis to Atomic Multi-path Payments (AMP) invoices. He reached out to the Lightning Network Development mailing list for answers. In response, Laolu Osuntokun provided valuable information regarding the compatibility of different wallet versions with AMP invoices. According to Osuntokun, wallets built on lnd v0.14 should be capable of sending to reusable AMP invoices. However, wallets built on lnd v0.13 can only send to them once, unless the `set_id` flag is manually specified for subsequent sends. This clarified the issue for Jozef and shed light on the specific requirements for using AMP invoices with different wallet versions.Furthermore, Osuntokun addressed Jozef's concerns about the future of AMP and its potential as a standard in the lightning network. He explained that AMP could be viewed as the successor to keysend and expressed intentions to finalize the current spec draft. Osuntokun hoped to propose it as either a BOLT or a bLIP in the near future. Although it had been on his TODO list for some time, he aimed to accomplish this task over the next few weeks.In addition, Osuntokun mentioned the possibility of future updates to AMP. When Payment-Point Time-Locked Contracts (PTLCs) are eventually implemented across the network, AMP could be enhanced to utilize discrete-logs instead of payment hashes. This variation would be referred to as Discrete Log Atomic Multi-Path (DAMP). Furthermore, Osuntokun highlighted that AMP has the potential to support receiver secret-reveal by combining each share with a receiver-specified public key.Overall, Osuntokun's response provided Jozef with helpful insights into the current state of AMP and its potential evolution as a standard in the lightning network. It clarified compatibility issues with different wallet versions and shed light on future enhancements such as DAMP and receiver secret-reveal.</summary>
