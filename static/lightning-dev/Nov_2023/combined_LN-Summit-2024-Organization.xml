    <summary>Antoine Riard has communicated his decision to not attend the African Bitcoin conferences in December due to logistical challenges. Despite this, he remains committed to organizing a Lightning Network (LN) Summit in June 2024 but is now considering alternative locations such as London, Paris, or South France, as operations there would be more straightforward. He plans to provide an update on this matter by February.

In a separate note, Antoine addresses safety concerns for tourists in certain districts of Oran and Algier, referencing the US travel advisory's classification of these areas as safe. Nonetheless, he recognizes that high-violence rates could pose risks similar to those in major US cities if one ends up in the wrong neighborhood. He extends his observations to the broader issue of violence in Islamic countries with fundamentalist populations, a concern also relevant to France based on his experience during the Bataclan attacks in Paris. Antoine underscores the importance of adhering to safety precautions while traveling, such as avoiding unsanitary places, staying in groups, and maintaining awareness of one's surroundings.

Antoine also highlights the cumbersome nature of visa procedures and suggests advocating for streamlined e-visa programs using zero-knowledge proofs (zkp) and bitcoin fidelity bonds to simplify and accelerate the process. He emphasizes the advance planning necessary for event organization in Africa, given the complex visa requirements.

Antoine's Algerian friend strongly advises against hosting a conference in Algeria, citing its lack of tourist infrastructure, high violence, and fundamentalist beliefs within its population. She notes the potential risks for solo female travelers and the problematic visa acquisition process. Peter Todd's website [https://petertodd.org](https://petertodd.org) offers further insights into these concerns.

Regarding health precautions for travel, the email distinguishes between medical risks associated with different geographical areas and the extent of health coverage provided by insurers. While the sender has managed to avoid vaccinations for some African countries visited, they recognize the differences in health coverage between European and US visitors. They recall a successful past meeting in Zurich where Taproot integration was discussed and stress the collaborative nature of Lightning development.

Antoine expresses interest in attending large conferences on the African continent despite the need for additional medical precautions like vaccinations. He details the logistical considerations for choosing Ghana as the preferred location for the LN Summit due to its previous success in hosting the Afro Bitcoin Conference and its reasonable operational stability. Backup options include Morocco or Algeria for their French-speaking communities or South Africa, though it presents logistical challenges. Visa requirements are acknowledged, but ECOWAS passport holders may have exemptions. Antoine is willing to cover the hard logistical costs of the LN Summit and clarifies that the event is invitation-only for Lightning developers and researchers. He invites interested contributors to join a Signal group for summit organization discussions.

The feasibility of hosting an LN summit in Africa is questioned due to the inconvenience and added costs from additional travel requirements and limited direct flights. Concerns about the organizer's ability to manage the event effectively from afar are raised.

Antoine proposes surveying stable African countries for the summit location and encourages participation from the LN developer community. His prior experience co-organizing the CoreDev event in Zurich provides him with operational knowledge. He asserts the value of transparency and accountability in organizing events and seeks feedback from attendees. A dedicated communication endpoint has been established for LN Summit 2024 organization, emphasizing a collaborative approach to knowledge transfer among contributors.</summary>
