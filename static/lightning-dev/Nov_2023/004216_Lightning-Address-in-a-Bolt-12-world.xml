    <summary>The email from Andy Schroder addresses a technical challenge concerning the operational aspects of Lightning nodes. The crux of the issue lies in the necessity for Lightning nodes to acquire a DNSSEC tree without resorting to platform-dependent solutions like "just call delv" or directly sending UDP packets. Andy underscores the need for a future-proof strategy that would involve incorporating the RFC 9102 CHAIN serialization format into the node_announcement. This approach, however, demands the availability of cross-platform client software capable of validating a serialized CHAIN. Andy acknowledges the absence of such software presently but also notes that creating it should theoretically be feasible, although no concrete solution is provided within the correspondence.</summary>
