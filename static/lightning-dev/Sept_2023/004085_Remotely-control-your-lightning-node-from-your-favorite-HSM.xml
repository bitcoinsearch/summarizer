    <summary>Good morning, In the email conversation, ZmnSCPxj mentions that CLN already has something similar in standard CLN distrib, which can be found at https://docs.corelightning.org/docs/commando. However, it is specifically tied to the CLN command set. Despite this, it shares a similar concept with what is being discussed. Regards,ZmnSCPxj</summary>
