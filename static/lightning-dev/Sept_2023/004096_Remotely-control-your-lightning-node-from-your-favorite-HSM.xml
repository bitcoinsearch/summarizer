    <summary>The email discusses the use of runes in programming, specifically how they are often bound to the BOLT8 nodeid to protect them from being read. The author expresses a liking for this model but notes that it requires two-way communication for setup, where the Hardware Security Module (HSM) tells the node its id and the node gives the HSM the rune. However, the author mentions that supporting runes as an extension is easy and allows for experimentation. The email concludes with a mention of further discussion on a gist.</summary>
