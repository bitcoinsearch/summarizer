    <summary>In the email, Gijs van Dam addresses their previous discussion on Link MPP and introduces a proof of concept called Payment Splitting &amp; Switching (PSS). The PSS plugin has been developed as a core-lightning plugin and aims to split payments into multiple parts. One part follows the original route and commits to an HTLC with a lesser amount, while the recipient waits for another payment from the sender. The additional payment is sent over an alternative route, contingent on the payment hash of the original payment.The interest in Link MPP and PSS stems from Gijs van Dam's research on the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA), also known as the probing attack. PSS allows for route changes and amount changes without the sender's knowledge, which affects how an attacker interprets information obtained through a BDA. In a simulation using real-world data, the deployment of PSS resulted in a significant drop of up to 62% in information gain compared to earlier work without PSS. More details about this research can be found in Gijs van Dam's preprint on the Cryptology ePrint Archive.Gijs van Dam welcomes feedback on their research and expresses interest in hearing thoughts on how PSS could mitigate probing and/or jamming attacks. They have written a set of blog posts introducing the research, which can be accessed through the provided links. Additionally, they mention that PSS may also work with PTLC, but this topic will be discussed separately.Overall, the email discusses the development of the Payment Splitting &amp; Switching (PSS) plugin by Gijs van Dam. It highlights the potential applications of PSS in mitigating probing and/or jamming attacks, as well as its impact on the Balance Discovery Attack (BDA). The email provides links to further resources and invites feedback on the research.</summary>
