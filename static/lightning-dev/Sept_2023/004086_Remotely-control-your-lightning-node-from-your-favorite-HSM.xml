    <summary>In a recent email, the sender mentions their interest in the commando plugin and expresses the need for additional security features. They highlight that while commando also uses a lightning connection to send commands to a lightning node, it lacks an important aspect that they believe is crucial. The missing feature is the handling of Bolt 8 by the HSM (Hardware Security Module) and the validation of commands using a trusted display. According to the sender, these additions would enhance security without compromising user experience and enable secure remote control from a mobile phone. For further information on the commando plugin, the sender provides a link to the documentation: https://docs.corelightning.org/docs/commando</summary>
