    <summary>In an email exchange, Derek Atkins, the CTO at SecureRF Corporation, reaches out to Rusty Russell to discuss the feasibility of using AEDSA in a prototype and its potential performance for presenting at the next Scaling Bitcoin workshop. Atkins asks whether the changes would be limited to Lightning or if updates to bitcoind/alphad would also be required. This inquiry is in response to Jeremy Rubin's proposal of incorporating new signature schemes into Bitcoin and utilizing multi-signature variants in the Lightning Network.Rusty Russell acknowledges the possibility of implementing the hybrid approach suggested by Rubin but highlights the challenges associated with introducing novel cryptography into Bitcoin. He mentions that signatures of 64k would not significantly impact the logistical aspect of the Lightning Network, while giant pubkeys might pose some issues. However, he suggests using the Bitcoin trick of referencing them through RIPEMD160 as a possible solution.Russell further explains that AEDSA signatures are not constant in length and have sizes of around 6000 bits. Despite this, they offer a substantial increase in verification performance compared to ECDSA. Atkins concludes the email by reminding recipients about the confidential nature of the information provided.To summarize, Derek Atkins contacts Rusty Russell to inquire about using AEDSA in a prototype and gauging its performance for presentation purposes. Russell responds by acknowledging the feasibility of the proposed hybrid approach but emphasizes the challenges of integrating new cryptographic elements into Bitcoin. He also discusses the potential logistical issues related to giant pubkeys and suggests a workaround using RIPEMD160. Additionally, Russell highlights the superior verification performance of AEDSA signatures over ECDSA.</summary>
