    <summary>A user named Cezary Dziemian expressed their desire for an option to create amountless invoices in Lightning Labs' implementation, lnd. In response, Olaoluwa Osuntokun suggested that Cezary make an issue on lnd's issue tracker instead of posting requests on a list. Rusty Russell, a developer, added to the thread by stating that c-lightning, another Lightning Network implementation, can currently pay amountless invoices using the "pay" command but cannot create them via the c-lightning "invoice" command. He filed an issue for this on Github. Rusty also mentioned that he would prefer the "msatoshi" field to be a magic string rather than omitting the parameter altogether, as omitting it could lead to bugs.In an email exchange between Cezary Dziemian and Rusty Russell, Cezary asked if Lightning Labs had plans to introduce this feature soon or if they would have to switch to c-lightning. Rusty responded by pointing out that the issue should be addressed on lnd's issue tracker rather than through emails. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, mentioned on the Lightning-dev mailing list that currently, c-lightning can pay amountless invoices but cannot create them via the "invoice" command. Rusty filed an issue for this on Github and provided a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning using the "lightning-cli pay" command. However, he also suggested that the "msatoshi" field should be a magic string instead of being omitted to avoid potential bugs. The email exchange concluded with a disclaimer about not using the mailing list for support requests or features for individual implementations and a link to lnd's issue tracker.Another user on the Lightning-dev mailing list raised the point that c-lightning does not currently allow users to create amountless invoices via the "invoice" command. They noted that c-lightning is capable of paying amountless invoices using the "pay" command and requested for this issue to be addressed. The user also offered a solution for paying an amountless invoice in c-lightning, which involves using the "pay" command with the Lightning Network Invoice (LNI) code and the desired amount in satoshis. Rusty Russell acknowledged the issue and mentioned that he has filed an issue report on Github for it. He provided the link to the issue report for reference.It was discovered that the c-lightning command in the Lightning Network has the ability to pay invoices without specifying an amount, but it cannot create such invoices through the "invoice" command. The "pay" command can be used to pay an amountless invoice by specifying the Lightning Network Invoice (LNI) and the number of satoshis to pay. Although the JSON-RPC command requires an amount, the rest of the code treats it as optional, indicating that the internals of c-lightning should be able to handle creating amountless invoices. ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network, stated that they will investigate how to enable the creation of amountless invoices in c-lightning. A user on the lightning-dev mailing list sought confirmation regarding the optional nature of the "amount" field in a Lightning Network invoice, or if there is another way to send payment when the sender does not specify an amount.</summary>
