    <summary>During a discussion on the Lightning Network implementation, Johan and Rusty identified two problems with the current protocol. The first issue arises from only one side (funder) setting fees, which can lead to disagreements and channel closures. To address this problem, they propose allowing both sides to set fees independently during the channel creation process. This solution has been implemented in c-lightning. The proposed approach involves disallowing fee updates that the other side cannot afford based on their current HTLCs and max accepted HTLCs. Additionally, any new HTLCs that cannot be paid for should also be disallowed.The second problem discussed is the difficulty in predicting future fees. To overcome this challenge, the authors suggest allowing multiple simultaneous fee levels. However, implementing this feature requires more work and storage due to the inclusion of multiple signatures in each commitment_signed message.In conclusion, the post presents these two problems with the Lightning Network protocol and proposes solutions for each. The proposed solutions aim to improve fee setting and predictability. The author invites feedback on these proposals, indicating an openness to further refinement of the protocol.</summary>
