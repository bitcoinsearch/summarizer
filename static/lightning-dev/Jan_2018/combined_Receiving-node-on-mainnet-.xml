    <summary>In an email sent to the Lightning-dev mailing list, Adán Sánchez de Pedro Crespo, the CTO of Stampery Inc., expressed his gratitude and offered assistance to the sender. He suggested using the LN Discord platform's #mainnet channel for discussions related to mainnet nodes. Adán also proposed playing "the invoice game" with the sender if they shared their node_id and IP address. Stampery Inc., a company with offices in San Francisco and Madrid, is where Adán works. The email attachment was in HTML format but contained no additional information. An OpenPGP digital signature attachment named 'signature.asc' was included in the email signature.For those interested in testing mainnet Lightning Network nodes, the Lightning Network subreddit is recommended as a valuable resource. This subreddit provides ample discussion among individuals who already have mainnet nodes and could potentially offer insights for testing purposes. A user named Cezary Dziemian reached out to the Lightning-dev mailing list seeking advice on becoming a receiving node on the mainnet. They mentioned the need to communicate with existing nodes to convince them to "lock" funds on their side.The sender of the email is interested in conducting tests on the mainnet as the Lightning Network expands. Their goal is to receive funds through LN, requiring them to engage with existing nodes and persuade them to allocate funds on their end. They are specifically inquiring about a platform where individuals who have set up mainnet nodes can gather and discuss related topics.</summary>
