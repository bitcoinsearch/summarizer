    <summary>In a recent discussion about the Lightning Network BOLT specification, a developer raised a question regarding the layout of the payment_hash field in the donation payment transaction (txn) of the second lines stanza. The developer expressed curiosity about why this layout differs from the expected format and proposed an alternative approach using a 0x20 code to indicate a non-bitcoin value or reserved value. They argued that such a change could simplify the optimization process for deep inspection.The developer provided a specific example highlighting the existing layout of other fields in the specification and suggested simplifying the format for none_bc_value. By adopting a code like 0x20, it would be easier to identify and differentiate non-bitcoin values or reserved values during deep inspection, potentially streamlining the optimization efforts.The message concludes with the abbreviation "lnbc," which is commonly used in the context of the Lightning Network.</summary>
