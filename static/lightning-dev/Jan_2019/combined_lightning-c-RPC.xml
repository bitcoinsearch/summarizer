    <summary>In an email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Alex P raised a question regarding the possibility of binding RPC to IP:port instead of a unix socket. Rene, in response, explained that this feature is currently not being implemented but suggested two avenues for further assistance.Rene recommended that Alex P submit their inquiry through the bug tracker at https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning or seek help from the c-lightning mailing list at https://lists.ozlabs.org/listinfo/c-lightning. By doing so, Alex P would be able to engage with the community and potentially find a solution to their query.Aware that editing the source code is one option, the user expressed their interest in discovering if there is a configuration parameter available for achieving the desired binding of RPC to IP:port instead of a unix socket. With this in mind, they reached out to the Lightning-dev mailing list for guidance from the community.To facilitate further communication, Rene shared his contact information at the end of the email, offering direct assistance if needed.</summary>
