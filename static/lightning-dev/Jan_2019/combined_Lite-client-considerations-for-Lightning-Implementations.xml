    <summary>The author of the message is enthusiastic about the prospects of Lightning in 2019 and has taken the initiative to revive a lite client project in bitcoin-s. This project aims to create a modern replacement for bitcoinj that can be utilized for Layer 2 (L2) applications such as Lightning. The primary objective is to implement traditional Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) and subsequently incorporate neutrino, once development on that front resumes in Bitcoin Core.In the event that the implementation of neutrino in Bitcoin Core takes an extended period of time, the project team will consider implementing neutrino against btcd. In order to successfully accomplish this, various features need to be implemented, including a Bitcoin wallet, the ability to monitor channels, and the capability to validate channels. As the number of channels grows, it may become impractical to individually watch every channel, prompting the need to explore alternative methods such as Electrum servers' approach of retrieving a transaction from its coordinates.Furthermore, the utilization of Bloom Filters and client-side filters becomes imperative in order to download all blocks without necessarily storing them all. It is crucial that the lite wallet supports mobile platforms, particularly Android. Java 7 is currently being employed, therefore, it is suggested that plain Java or Kotlin be considered instead of Scala, whenever possible.To ensure user-friendliness for lightning developers, the mailing list has been requested to provide insights on "things to consider" from a usability perspective. One notable suggestion is to adhere to the Bitcoin Core API whenever feasible, as this would facilitate the ease of using bitcoin-s as a drop-in lite client replacement for Bitcoin Core.</summary>
