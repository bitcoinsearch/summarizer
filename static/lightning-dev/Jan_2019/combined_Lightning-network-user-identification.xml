    <summary>The conversation between ZmnSCPxj and João Joyce focuses on the issue of privacy in Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) payments. They discuss the concern that if the base layer is nonprivate, it would be difficult to regain privacy. The lack of standardization is seen as a significant challenge in moving this feature to user hardware. João questions whether any wallet currently has this capability and if wallets are the right place for it. He also wonders if other apps should be given access to pre-images of LN payments. Both parties express hope for a replacement for email/password as an authentication method.In another email conversation, João discusses the issue of connecting multiple payments to a user account in Bitcoin and Lightning. He suggests that the user software should handle management of all preimages for items purchased, creating a virtual "user identity" and "Bitcoin wallet". This would reduce privacy leakage as vendors cannot link different purchases to the same user. However, ZmnSCPxj emphasizes that users should have control over what information they reveal and it should not be required for any purchase. The principle of privacy first is highlighted, with higher layers potentially supporting persistent user IDs while keeping the base layer nonprivate.On a Lightning-dev mailing list, a user raises concerns about user identification in the context of payments for goods and services. They propose using SQRL or BitID for anonymity, but note the inconvenience of having separate apps for login and payments. Instead, they suggest a scenario where a user can scan a LN invoice at an ebook store, confirming payment and identity in one action without creating an account or logging in. The idea of using the payment preimage as a unique user ID is mentioned, ensuring that user IDs are only usable if paid for. The user questions the need for multiple apps and the privacy risks associated with services that require personal information like email accounts.In the same email thread, João asks if it is possible to identify users across multiple LN requests or authenticate them in a single step using an LN wallet. He presents use cases such as pay-per-view events, music-streaming services, and vending machines that provide discounts or reward points anonymously. ZmnSCPxj explains that currently, this is not possible and questions the need to violate user privacy for a service. João suggests allowing users to keep and prove a single identity across multiple payments for the same store, which would enhance privacy and transition to better authentication practices. He proposes having a unique userID valid only for a specific store, eliminating the need for account creation or login and avoiding the storage of private user data.In a forum post, João asks if there is a way to identify a user across multiple LN requests or authenticate them in a single step using a LN wallet. He provides various use cases where this feature could be beneficial, such as pay-per-view events, music-streaming apps, vending machines, arcade games, and multiplayer gaming. The post concludes with a question about the current possibility of this feature.</summary>
