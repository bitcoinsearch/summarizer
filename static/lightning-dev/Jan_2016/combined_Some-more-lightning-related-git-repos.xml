    <summary>ACINQ has released a new scala implementation of "deployable lightning" on Github. The implementation aims to have an actor per lightning channel, ensuring non-blocking operations and compatibility with Rusty&amp;aj's implementation. It utilizes the same protobuf messages and a similar state machine. ACINQ has also conducted prototyping on onion routing, which is soon to be replaced.On the Lightning-dev mailing list, Bryan Bishop shared several related git repositories. These include lnd, lightning-onion, lightning, and thundernetwork. However, it should be noted that Bryan has not reviewed any of the source code for quality, security, or functionality.Furthermore, two repositories were discovered in the -wizards IRC channel today, which Bryan had not reviewed for quality, security, or functionality. These repositories are https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd and https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lightning-onion. Additionally, Bryan provided links to other git repositories with related work, such as https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning and https://github.com/matsjj/thundernetwork. It is important to mention that Bryan has not provided any information regarding the status of these repositories.In the context, Bryan's contact details are also mentioned, including his website http://heybryan.org/ and phone number 1 512 203 0507.</summary>
