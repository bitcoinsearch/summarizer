    <summary>The sender of the email expresses concern about the long-term viability of the website delvingbitcoin.org, particularly when considering a timeframe of 10 years into the future. The preference is expressed for maintaining a mailing list (ML) for its assured longevity and relevance, as the sender is willing to host it due to personal projects that also require an ML. Additionally, the possibility of using lists.sr.ht is suggested as a potential backup solution, possibly functioning as an archive mailing list. Despite these concerns and suggestions, the sender does not oppose the use of delvingbitcoin.org and acknowledges its accessibility for users with screen readers, including the individual named Vincent.</summary>
