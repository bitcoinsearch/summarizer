    <summary>On March 16, 2019, Rusty Russell, a member of the Lightning Network development team, announced that the Linux Foundation, which hosts the Lightning-dev mailing list, is deprecating its mailing list infrastructure and migrating lists to groups.io. The migration is expected to take place within a week, following the direction of bitcoin-dev. Rusty advised subscribers who wish to unsubscribe from the list to do so before the migration. However, he assured subscribers that no action is required to remain on the list as long as they don't unsubscribe. The decision to migrate the mailing list infrastructure was made by the Linux Foundation due to their dissatisfaction with the maintenance of mailman2 and the messy nature of v3. Rusty mentioned that this move aligns with the direction that bitcoin-dev is taking. He expects the Lightning-dev mailing list to follow suit within a week unless any concerns are raised. Those who want to unsubscribe from the list can do so before the migration takes place.</summary>
