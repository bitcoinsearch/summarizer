    <summary>In a recent email exchange on the Lightning-dev mailing list, a member jokingly suggested that the c-lightning team might introduce proof of stake to Bitcoin or change its monetary policy. The team clarified that they have no plans to do so but are open to new name suggestions for their next release. Some previous release names were mentioned, including "Federal Qualitative Strengthening," "(Still) Scaling the Ethereum Blockchain," "Blockchain Good, Orange Coin Bad," and "Bitcoin's Proof of Stake."The confusion surrounding the name "Ethereum Layer 2" for the recently announced c-lightning 0.10.1 release was addressed by Michael Folkson. He assured everyone that the c-lightning team has no intention of introducing proof of stake to Bitcoin or changing its monetary policy, as they had done with previous release names. The team is open to suggestions for future release names.Lisa Neigut sent an email announcing the release of c-lightning 0.10.1, which was named by @nalinbhardwaj. However, Prayank expressed confusion about whether the release was related to Ethereum and asked about the connection between the Ethereum layer and this release.The c-lightning 0.10.1 release is a recommended upgrade that includes compulsory payment secrets in invoices and incompatible experimental features. Users of the rebalance or drain plugins must update since payment secret is now mandatory. The upgrade also brings new features for users, such as `experimental-dual-fund`, Taproot support for `withdraw` and `close`, and the ability to query `listchannels` by destination and source. Developers will find improvements to manual pages and plugins, along with the separation of the HSM daemon into libhsmd and Python bindings. The changelog provides more details on updates and bug fixes. The release involved 526 commits from 15 different authors over 114 days, with six first-time contributors.</summary>
