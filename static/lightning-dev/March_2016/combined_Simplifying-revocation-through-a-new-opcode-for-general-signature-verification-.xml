    <summary>On March 8, 2016, Martijn Meijering from the Lightning Network development team put forward a proposal to introduce a new opcode for signature verification in Bitcoin's scripting system. The purpose of this opcode would be to verify appropriately length-restricted messages, with the aim of simplifying the Lightning Network protocol. By using this opcode, the need to reveal hash preimages and maintain mirror images of transactions could be eliminated. Instead, users would only need to sign a message that revokes a previous balance using a hash and sequence number. Meijering sought feedback on whether there were any oversights in the proposal and suggested that the introduction of this new opcode could greatly simplify the LN protocol. This proposal was discussed on the Lightning-dev mailing list.</summary>
