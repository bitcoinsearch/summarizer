The member, Cezary Dziemian, posted the message on October 8th and noted that there had been no discussion on the list since September 19th.

This archive allows users to review past conversations and stay up to date with the latest information.It is important to note that the member's concern regarding their subscription is not directly addressed in the discussion. However, it is implied that the lack of emails may be attributed to the absence of recent discussions rather than an issue with their subscription. The member also mentioned an unrelated advertisement for virus protection in their message, which may be considered irrelevant to their initial concern.In summary, a member of the Lightning-dev mailing list expressed worry over not receiving any emails since joining the list a week ago. There had been no discussion on the list since September 19th, prompting another member to advise checking the mailing list archive for existing discussions.
