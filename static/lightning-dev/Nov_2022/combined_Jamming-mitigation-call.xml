    <summary>In an email exchange between Clara Shikhelman and Antoine Riard, they discussed the agenda for an upcoming meeting regarding solutions for channel jamming in Lightning Network. The first item on the agenda is to discuss which parameters should be considered in reputation-based solutions. Antoine suggests that before discussing such parameters, they should first determine the security goal they aim to achieve with any potential jamming solution. He believes that a security goal designed in terms of a monetary strategy could be more acceptable to routing hops node operators.Antoine also brings up the circuit breaker and wonders if congestion control of the HTLC flows is another issue that needs to be addressed. He suggests that a node operator is not only interested in receiving routing fees but is also interested in processing more forward demand than liquidity offer by deferring and sending backpressure messages to the HTLC sender.Lastly, Antoine talks about the onion relay network and its potential uses. He discusses how rate-limits were previously discussed and proposes a probabilistic backpressure scheme. However, he believes that if the onion relay traffic starts to have economically-weighable traffic, there could be a risk of onion-jamming. To address this concern, he suggests leveraging the channel-network topology for designing a solution.Regarding meeting frequency, Clara explains that biweekly meetings are preferred because it keeps things fresh, but Lightning developers have raised concerns that it might be too much. As a result, they will start publishing summaries for those who cannot attend. Additionally, Antoine suggests having reliable transcripts and maintaining a community repository where they can pin issues, problems, and ideas.</summary>
