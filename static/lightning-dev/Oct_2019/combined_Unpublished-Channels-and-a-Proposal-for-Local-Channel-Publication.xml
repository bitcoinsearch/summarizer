    <summary>ZmnSCPxj, a contributor to the Lightning Network protocol mailing list, has put forward a novel approach to address the sharing of information about unpublished channels among nodes on the network. Currently, one node can request another node to disclose information about a shared channel to friends. However, ZmnSCPxj's proposal suggests a whispering mechanism where nodes can discreetly exchange information about unpublished channels they have with other nodes. This would enable them to circumvent the Axiom of Terminus and share details about unpublished channels more widely.In addition, the proposal aims to mitigate the risk of exposing LittleNode's history by looking up the short-channel-id on the blockchain. By considering potential solutions to this issue, ZmnSCPxj demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the challenges associated with sharing information about unpublished channels.Another interesting aspect highlighted in the proposal is the possibility of creating subnets on the Lightning Network using Channel Factory. These subnets could function similarly to a node composed of smaller components called nodelets. The article delves into the tradeoffs between utilizing channel factories versus nodelets, providing valuable insights for network participants.Within the discussion, the article explores the Axiom of Terminus and its impact on payment analysis within the Lightning Network. This axiom asserts that an unpublished channel may exist at one or both ends of a payment route but not in the middle. Consequently, entities with significant control over Bitcoin holdings can closely monitor network participants, particularly if they possess numerous unpublished channels.To overcome the limitations imposed by the Axiom of Terminus, the article puts forth concepts such as local publication. This entails introducing new messages like the `request_local_unpublished_channels` and `respond_local_unpublished_channels`, which allow for the exchange of data regarding local unpublished channels. By introducing these messages, the proposal offers a practical framework for breaking the axiom and expanding the sharing of information about unpublished channels.Overall, the article provides a comprehensive exploration of the challenges posed by the Axiom of Terminus in the Lightning Network. It introduces innovative ideas and suggests potential solutions, such as whispering mechanisms and local publication methods, to enable more widespread sharing of information about unpublished channels. The proposal also delves into the creation of subnets using Channel Factory, presenting an alternative approach to node composition. With its thorough analysis and practical recommendations, this article contributes valuable insights to the field of Lightning Network protocol development.</summary>
