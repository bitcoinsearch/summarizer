    <summary>The Lightning Network is exploring ways to implement messaging in order to improve communication mechanisms and make polling more reliable. The current proposal for asynchronous payments involves the payer pre-signing a transaction and sending it to their local channel partner. The signed transaction is then sent to the payee in an encrypted communication channel, allowing the payee to decide whether or not to receive payment before a certain timeout. This approach helps facilitate payment without locking up funds for long periods of time. However, there are concerns regarding privacy, locked up capital, and secure communication channels.The email thread discusses the issue of asynchronous payments on the Lightning Network and suggests using the Lightning Rod Protocol by Breez to avoid the need for both parties to be online simultaneously. However, this method requires funds to be locked up for longer than usual. A proposed solution involves the payer pre-signing a transaction and sending it to the payee in an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. The payee can sell the signature to their local channel partner using payment points and scalars. This enables truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and provides another reason to move to payment points and scalars. Privacy concerns and locked up capital are addressed by splitting the payment between the channel partner and public routing nodes. Communication channel security is crucial and can be achieved through the use of decentralized paid mail server systems.The conversation also discusses how to enable asynchronous payments in the Lightning Network by having only two states: before the payee receives payment and after the payee receives payment. The proposed solution involves pre-signing a transaction and sending it to the payee in an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. The payee can then sell the signature to their local channel partner using payment points and scalars. This approach outsources routing to the channel partner and allows for truly asynchronous payments. However, there are potential issues with privacy, locked up capital, communication channel security, and proof of payment. To address these concerns, safeguards and protocols must be implemented.Konstantin Ketterer proposes a solution for asynchronous payments that involves pre-signing a transaction and sending it to the payee in an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. The payee can sell the signature to their local channel partner using payment points and scalars. This approach utilizes eltoo to avoid toxic channel states. Privacy concerns are addressed by splitting the payment between the channel partner and public routing nodes. Locked up capital can be managed by overwriting or rebalancing payments. Communication channels must be secure, and the use of decentralized paid mail server systems is suggested. Another solution is proposed where the payee signs a new settlement transaction and sends it to the payer, who pays the channel partner to sign the update transaction. This enables truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and provides another reason to move to payment points and scalars.The conversation discusses the issue of both parties needing to be online simultaneously to send/receive money in the Lightning Network. The proposed solution involves pre-signing a transaction and sending it to the payee in an end-to-end encrypted communication channel. The payee can sell the signature to their local channel partner using payment points and scalars. This approach requires the use of eltoo to handle toxic channel states and ensures that funds are not held hostage. Privacy concerns are addressed by splitting the payment between the channel partner and public routing nodes. Locked up capital can be managed by overwriting or rebalancing payments. Communication channels must be end-to-end encrypted, and additional protocols for proof of payment are suggested. Another solution is proposed where the payee signs a new settlement transaction and sends it to the payer, who acts as a watchtower while the payee is offline. Overall, the proposed solutions enable truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and provide reasons to move to payment points and scalars.In conclusion, the Lightning Network is exploring ways to implement messaging to enhance communication mechanisms and improve the reliability of polling. The proposed solutions for asynchronous payments involve pre-signing transactions and using end-to-end encrypted communication channels. This approach allows for truly asynchronous Lightning network payments and outsources routing to channel partners. However, there are concerns regarding privacy, locked up capital, communication channel security, and proof of payment. Proper safeguards and protocols must be implemented to address these concerns and ensure the effectiveness and security of the system.</summary>
