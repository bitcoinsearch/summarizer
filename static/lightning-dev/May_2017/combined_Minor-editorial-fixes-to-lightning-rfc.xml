    <summary>ZmnSCPxj expressed gratitude to someone for contributing to the Lightning Network RFC repository on GitHub. They suggested that minor fixes should be submitted as pull requests on GitHub instead of through email to avoid spamming the mailing list. However, ZmnSCPxj mentioned that personal submissions are still accepted if necessary. They also explained that the mailing list is mainly used for discussing significant change proposals, which should ideally begin with a GitHub patch.A developer had submitted minor editorial patches for lightning-rfc via email. Rusty Russell, representing the Lightning Network team, thanked the developer for the patches but advised them to submit the patches as GitHub pull requests to prevent excessive emails on the mailing list. Russell further emphasized that the mailing list is primarily used for discussing major changes, and even these changes would benefit from starting with a GitHub patch.The developer's email included three patches: one for 02-peer-protocol.md, one for 07-routing-gossip.md (involving moving text about IPv6 and port from channel_update to node_announcement), and another for 07-routing-gossip.md (updating text regarding end indication). All three patches have been applied and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/161.In addition, ZmnSCPxj sent an email containing minor editorial patches for lighting-rfc. The email consisted of three attachments, two of which were patches named "0001-02-peer-protocol.md-Minor-typo-update_htlc_add-verb-.patch" and "0003-07-routing-gossip.md-channel_update-Update-text-about.patch." The third attachment, titled "0002-07-routing-gossip.md-Move-some-text-about-ipv6-and-p.patch," pertained to IPv6 and patch movement.</summary>
