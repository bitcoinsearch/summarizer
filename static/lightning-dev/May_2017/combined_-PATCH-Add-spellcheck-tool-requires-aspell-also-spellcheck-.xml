    <summary>A member of the Lightning-dev forum, ZmnSCPxj, shared a patch on Github for lightning-rfc. However, another user named Rusty pointed out that the patch had line-wrapping and whitespace issues, making it difficult to apply. Rusty took it upon himself to fix these errors, as well as work through spelling mistakes. He also added a Travis check to prevent future errors. The final fixed patch can be found on the Github pull request page numbered 153.Moving on, the passage discusses various patches applied to the Basis of Lightning Technology (BOLT) used in the Lightning Network. These patches address several aspects such as standardizing pluralization for 'HTLC', explaining channel reserve and the use of 'push-msat', describing the retransmission process for channel messages, outlining the unique set of keys used in commitment transactions, and discussing the structure of an onion packet used in onion routing.Furthermore, the passage explains the process of forwarding a hashed time-locked contract (HTLC) packet through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network. It provides examples of error packets that can occur during forwarding and delves into the process of blinding messages in the network.Additionally, the passage covers the different ways a channel can end: cooperation, force-close, and breach. It also discusses the handling of on-chain HTLC output. The official Noise protocol name for the Lightning Network's variant is "Noise_XK_secp256k1_ChaChaPoly_SHA256".Lastly, the passage mentions a script called spellcheck.sh that can be utilized for spellchecking files using Aspell. The script is located in the tools/ directory of the repository, with the homedir being specified there.</summary>
