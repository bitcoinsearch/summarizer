    <summary>In the context provided, ZmnSCPxj clarifies that Andrew Poelstra first proposed the idea of using payment points with scalars for Lightning. ZmnSCPxj's work on Scriptless Script was motivated by enabling Lightning over a MimbleWimble blockchain. The Multi-hop Locks paper proposes using payment points with scalars and path decorrelation. ZmnSCPxj believes this approach will be useful for various features including path decorrelation, high AMP, escrow over Lightning, stuckless payments, and pay-for-signature.Implementing relative locktimes in a MimbleWimble blockchain while retaining its "magical shrinking blockchain" property has been challenging. However, Andrew Poelstra has found a way to implement absolute locktimes without requiring excessive storage. Nadav Kohen has proposed a scheme for a trusted data provider to privately sell data using the Lightning Network. In another scenario, where an untrusted party attempts to sell its signature to a known message, payment points with scalars could ensure that the buyer pays only if they receive valid signatures for the CETs.The email thread discusses various topics related to Lightning Network and cryptocurrency. One email focuses on payment points and their potential benefits. Another email provides a detailed explanation of how to create a DLC and includes links for further information on Contract Execution Transactions (CETs). Nadav Kohen also shares a link to a document for readers interested in learning more about CETs. The emails provide insights into different aspects of the Lightning Network and its applications.Nadav Kohen proposed a scheme for selling data through the Lightning Network. The use of payment points with scalars, as suggested by ZmnSCPxj, can ensure that buyers only pay for valid signatures. This approach can be particularly useful in offering DLC-like Option contracts. A decentralized setup with normal DLC oracles is also proposed to achieve a more robust solution. However, there are concerns about the downside of the proposal, as it requires the seller to know which signature they are selling and therefore learn about the buyer's contract involvement.In summary, Nadav Kohen's proposed scheme aims to enable trusted data providers to sell data privately using the Lightning Network. The use of payment points with scalars ensures that buyers only pay for valid signatures in various scenarios, including offering DLC-like Option contracts. However, there are considerations regarding the downside of the proposal and the need for a more decentralized setup.</summary>
