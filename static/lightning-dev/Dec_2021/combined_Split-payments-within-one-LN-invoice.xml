    <summary>Ronan McGovern, an entrepreneur from Dublin, is developing Trelis.com, a platform for accepting Lightning payments. He reached out to the Lightning Network community to inquire about the possibility of creating an invoice that splits payments to two Lightning addresses. Ronan questioned whether this would require a protocol change or if it could be built using the existing protocol. He also mentioned encountering an app on LN Bits that claimed to split payments but did not work properly.Community members responded to Ronan's inquiry by explaining that splitting payments to multiple Lightning addresses is typically handled at the application level rather than requiring a protocol-level solution. They cited the Fountain podcasting app as an example of a similar functioning application. Although Ronan's question remains unanswered, it is suggested that handling partially failed payments can be challenging. Casarin proposed using exponential backoff until the payment completes for all parties involved. Currently, addressing this issue at the application level seems reasonable, but the potential future utility of standard protocols should not be disregarded.</summary>
