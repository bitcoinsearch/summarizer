    <summary>In a response to Mahesh Govind's inquiry on the Lightning-dev mailing list, Christian confirms that there is currently no functioning implementation for Ethereum. While the Raiden network has made efforts to adapt a Lightning-like network for Ethereum, the current status of this project remains uncertain. The differences in the underlying blockchain pose challenges for a direct port, but it is still possible to create a Lightning-like network for Ethereum.Mahesh, who is seeking guidance from experts, is looking for information about an implementation that can be utilized with Ethereum. However, the provided context is brief and lacks sufficient details. It seems that Mahesh is specifically interested in technical guidance concerning the implementation of Ethereum. Unfortunately, without additional information, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive response to address Mahesh's query adequately.</summary>
