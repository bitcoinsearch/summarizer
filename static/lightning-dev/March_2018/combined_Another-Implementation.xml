    <summary>Rusty, who contacted Kenichi, acknowledges his intelligent questions on the lightning-rfc GitHub and extends an invitation to join their Google Hangout every two weeks. This hangout is intended for discussing the progress of the specification. It is clear that Nayuta Inc. is actively involved in the development of the BOLT protocol and is committed to advancing the combination of cryptocurrency and IoT. By joining the Google Hangout, Kenichi and his team will have the opportunity to contribute further to the protocol's development. Rusty's invitation highlights the recognition and respect Nayuta Inc. has gained within the community.</summary>
