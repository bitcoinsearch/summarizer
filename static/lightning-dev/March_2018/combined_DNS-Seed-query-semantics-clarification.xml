    <summary>Thomas Steenholdt has proposed an update to BOLT #10 in pull request #396 and is seeking feedback. He also suggests addressing some other relevant things which may not be entirely clear such as the intended direction of interpreting conditions and what happens if a condition is specified multiple times. He uses the example of r0.a2.n5.a4.n10.seed.example.com to suggest that DNS seeds should process the conditions from the seed root and "up the tree" in a logical approach. He also suggests replacing currently set conditions when new conditions with the same key are met, allowing for easy programmatically adding of a condition to a query. Christian Decker welcomes improvements to the BOLT10 specification.The conversation between Thomas Steenholdt and Christian Decker revolves around clarifying the DNS Seed query semantics in BOLT10 specification. They address two issues - the intended direction of interpreting the conditions and the result of the conflict if a condition is specified multiple times. They use the example of r0.a2.n5.a4.n10.seed.example.com to illustrate their points. They assume a logical approach of interpreting from the seed root and "up the tree" for the first issue. For the second issue, they suggest replacing currently set conditions when encountering new conditions with the same key. This would allow easy addition of a condition to a query programmatically without limiting results. Thomas expresses willingness to help improve the BOLT10 specification and make a pull request for review. Christian welcomes any improvements to the specification.The context of this conversation is related to the BOLT10 specification. Thomas Steenholdt expressed his gratitude for an explanation he received, which helped him understand a piece of the puzzle he was missing. He offered to clarify the matter in the BOLT10 specification and make a pull request for review, which was welcomed by the other party.It is not clear what specific issue or section of the BOLT10 specification they are discussing, but it is evident that both parties are actively involved in contributing to its improvement. Pull requests are a common way of suggesting changes to open source projects like BOLT10, and it seems that the offer made by Thomas Steenholdt was well received.Overall, this is a positive conversation that highlights the collaborative and community-driven nature of open source development. It shows how individuals can contribute their skills and knowledge to improve technical standards and specifications, benefiting the wider community.Thomas Steenholdt was seeking clarification on the DNS seeds described in BOLT10 and reached out to Christian Decker. The specification was vague on the use of flags as subdomains in query semantics. Christian provided examples of how to query for IPv4 or IPv6 nodes with realm 0 or any realm using the appropriate subdomains, but pointed out that query filtering itself has not been implemented yet. Thomas expressed gratitude for the explanation and offered to help clarify the specification by making a pull request for review.In an email conversation between Christian Decker and Thomas Steenholdt, the latter was inquiring about the DNS seeds described in BOLT10 and how the query semantics work. The BOLT specifies that the DNS seed should support a list of key-value pairs, but Thomas was unsure about how these pairs are used in a query. Christian clarified that the flags are intended to be used as subdomains, such as querying for only realm IPv4 nodes by using "dig a2.seed.bitcoinstats.com". Alternatively, if one wants to query for IPv4 or IPv6 nodes, but only nodes with realm 0, they would use "dig r0.a6.seed.bitcoinstats.com". It is important to note that query filtering has not yet been implemented.Thomas is seeking clarification on DNS seeds described by BOLT10. He is unsure about the query semantics and how key-value pairs are used in a query. The BOLT states that DNS seed must support a list of key-value pairs, but Thomas is unclear about their usage. He is looking for pointers to help him understand better.</summary>
