Alongside these user-centric updates, numerous bug fixes have been implemented to enhance the overall user experience.In terms of network improvements, this release addresses issues such as spamming peers with dead channels and eliminating redundant gossip updates. It also incorporates the advertising of htlc_maximum_msat for channels, in accordance with a recent BOLT update. Internally, significant optimizations have been made in JSON command response. Moreover, connectd and hsmd are now part of the growing literate documentation effort.The latest release of c-lightning 0.6.2 recognizes contributions from 13 different authors, including three first-time c-lightning contributors.
