    <summary>Margherita Favaretto recently participated in "LightningHackdayNYC" where she presented her project on creating a recovering protocol for the Lightning Network. She has created a GitHub project to share her research and is seeking feedback and comments on her draft. The aim of her project is to address the issue of false positive nodes in the Eltoo mechanism, which currently does not cover cases where the other node shares an older transaction that benefits their balance. Margherita's solution involves using other connected nodes as backups for the most recent status. For each transaction between node A and B, node A sends encrypted information about the last commitment transaction with B to node C, and vice versa. This allows node A to retrieve information from the other connected node if it loses the last transactions, enabling it to update the status. Margherita believes that this idea can fill the current gap in Eltoo and plans to further analyze its feasibility.Johan, another member of the Lightning Network community, suggested that Margherita should explore "data loss protection" as defined in the BOLTs, as it aligns with her proposal. He also mentioned watchtowers and static and dynamic channel backups as potential areas of interest.Overall, Margherita's project aims to enhance the recovering protocol for the Lightning Network by solving the issue of false positive nodes. She welcomes thoughts, suggestions, and collaboration from anyone interested in her research. She is open to sharing more details about the design of her idea and working together to find a comprehensive solution that meets all needs.</summary>
