    <summary>In a recent discussion, Cezary and ZmnSCPxj talked about the Lightning Network (LN) and its functionality. They mentioned that while it is possible to open multiple channels in LND, c-lightning currently does not support this feature. The reason for this limitation is the trust issues involved in opening channels to multiple nodes. However, there is already an issue regarding this, and it may be added to BOLT, the protocol specification for LN, in the future.ZmnSCPxj suggested an alternative to dual-funding channels, which is to have incoming funds from one hub and make an outgoing payment to another hub. This approach not only encourages more hubs but also provides an alternate route if other routes become congested. Another suggestion was to create "circular superhubs" where small groups of users cooperate and open channels with each other. This allows for seamless payments to anyone on the network.They also discussed various options for receiving LN payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel. These options include trying the Blockstream Store route, publishing node and contact details, waiting for service deals, or asking a friend to channel to you. The third option, which offers a deal for up to 300mBTC receive for only 1mBTC with at least 3 months channel alive, may be particularly suitable for new businesses.Despite the inability to fund channels from both sides, they explored ways to overcome this limitation. Suggestions included emulating dual-funding channels by having a hubbing service make channels to you while you make a channel to another hub. Additionally, the concept of creating circular superhubs through cooperation among small groups of people was mentioned as a potential solution.In conclusion, there are several methods for receiving LN payments without locking funds on the other side of the channel. These methods include early adoption, publishing node and contact details, service deals, and asking friends to channel to you. The conversation between Cezary and ZmnSCPxj highlighted the importance of improving network connectivity, encouraging more participation, and addressing trust issues in the LN ecosystem.</summary>
