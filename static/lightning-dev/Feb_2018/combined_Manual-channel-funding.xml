    <summary>Alex P raised concerns about the lack of manual output selection and the absence of an option to fund channels with all available funds. When Alex P tried to utilize all their funds, they received a blockchain transaction with an output of 980 SAT. Christian, in response to the inquiry, suggested that the issue might be related to the interface exposed by the implementations. They advised Alex P to file an issue with the respective implementation on the Lightning-dev mailing list.At present, users do not have the ability to manually choose outputs for funding their channels on the platform. There is also no option to fund a channel with "all available funds". One user shared their experience of setting up a channel and attempting to use all their funds, which resulted in a blockchain transaction with an output of 980 SAT. The user proposed the implementation of an option to "take fee from funding amount" and the ability to select specific outputs to spend.To address these concerns, it would be beneficial for the platform to introduce features that allow users to manually choose the outputs for funding their channels. This would provide greater control and flexibility over channel funding. Additionally, the option to fund channels with all available funds should be made available, eliminating the need for users to manually calculate the funding amount.Furthermore, implementing the suggested feature of "taking fee from funding amount" would simplify the process and ensure that the fees are deducted automatically during channel funding. This would streamline the user experience and eliminate the need for manual calculations.In conclusion, addressing the concerns raised by Alex P regarding the inability to manually choose outputs for channel funding and the absence of an option to fund channels with all available funds is crucial. Implementing these features, along with the proposed option to "take fee from funding amount", would enhance user control, flexibility, and convenience in managing their channels on the platform.</summary>
