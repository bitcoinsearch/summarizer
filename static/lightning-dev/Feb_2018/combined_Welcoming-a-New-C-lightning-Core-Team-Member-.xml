    <summary>Rusty Russell and Christian Decker, the developers of c-lightning, have recently granted commit access to a contributor named ZmnSCPxj. Despite having limited knowledge about ZmnSCPxj, Rusty and Christian have made this decision based on his impressive track record of over 100 commits, many of which were significant. ZmnSCPxj has earned their professional respect through his valuable contributions to the project.In response to this announcement, Peter Todd suggested that pseudonyms should utilize PGP signing commits in order to ensure accountability. He emphasized the importance of following good code security practices. This recommendation highlights the need for transparency and responsible coding practices within the development community.Rusty and Christian are excited to witness ZmnSCPxj's expertise in providing excellent code and conducting thorough reviews, which will be crucial in identifying and rectifying any mistakes. They believe that sharing responsibility among contributors will only enhance the quality and progress of the project.Interestingly, ZmnSCPxj humorously mentioned his alignment with humanity in the face of an impending robot uprising, despite being a randomly-generated human. This lighthearted remark adds a touch of personality to the otherwise technical nature of the conversation.To facilitate effective communication and collaboration, Rusty and Christian have established a mailing list (ML) specifically dedicated to c-lightning. This platform will serve as a means for sharing major developments and fostering community engagement.Overall, the inclusion of ZmnSCPxj into the c-lightning project, alongside the discussion surrounding code security practices and the establishment of a dedicated mailing list, demonstrates the commitment of the developers towards enhancing the project's success and ensuring accountability within the development process.</summary>
