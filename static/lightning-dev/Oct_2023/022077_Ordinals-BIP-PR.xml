    <summary>The email discusses the issue of where certain wallet-related protocols, such as BIP69 (sorted keys), ypubs, and zpubs, should be housed if they are not considered BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals). The sender suggests that if these protocols cannot be included in the BIPs repository, they should be placed in another spec repository where they can be tracked and not lost. The SLIP (Standard for Localization and Internationalization Procedures) repository is proposed as a possible alternative, although the sender expresses some reservations about this solution. They mention that SLIP39 is not a BIP, possibly due to concerns about the exclusivity and perceived friction associated with the BIPs repository.

The sender also mentions OpenTimestamps and expresses a preference for it to be a BIP. They then discuss the Lightning Network (LN), noting that it is large enough to have its own spec repository which is actively maintained and used.

In relation to the approval process for BIPs, the sender points out that while BIPs do require the approval of Core maintainers to be merged, the text of BIP2 suggests that this approval should be a routine and automatic process. It should not depend on the relevance, interest, or desirability of the BIP to Core developers.

The email concludes with the sender's contact information and a lighthearted quote about the sun always shining in space.</summary>
