    <summary>Bitcoin Core version v24.2 has been released. The new version includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the GitHub issue tracker. To upgrade to the new version, users should shut down the older version and then run the installer on Windows or copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` on macOS or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` on Linux. Upgrading from an older version may take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. 

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on Linux, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. While it should also work on other Unix-like systems, it is not as frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

The new release includes several updates and fixes in different areas. In terms of fees, there is a fix that avoids serving stale fee estimates. Additionally, there is a fix for handling invalid bech32 addresses in the RPC and other APIs. The build system has been improved with dependencies updates, including xcb-proto 1.15.2. There are also specific fixes for macOS, such as fixing the qt package build with the new Xcode 15 linker and addressing unusable memory_resource in the macOS qt build. In terms of continuous integration (CI), there have been various improvements, including pruning dangling images, switching to amd64 container, and other optimizations. Finally, a miscellaneous improvement involves not using `std::vector = {}` to release memory.

The release credits go to Abubakar Sadiq Ismail, Hennadii Stepanov, Marco Falke, Michael Ford, and Pieter Wuille. Translations were also contributed by many others.
