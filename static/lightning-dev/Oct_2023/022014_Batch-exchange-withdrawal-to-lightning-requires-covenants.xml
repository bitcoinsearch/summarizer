    <summary>Antoine is seeking expert opinions on the robustness of secure fee-bumping for multi-party transactions and covenant-enable constructions under usual risk models. He provides a test link to a GitHub commit (https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/19d61fa8cf22a5050b51c4005603f43d72f1efcf) for reference.

Antoine specifically requests input from individuals who have a good understanding of both lightning and core mempool. He mentions that there has been a lot of discussion regarding the design rules of nversion=3, but the test is based on the glozow top commit of October 3, 2023.

The email is signed off with "Best, Antoine," indicating the end of the message.</summary>
