    <summary>The email is from Casey Rodarmor, who is expressing their frustration regarding the Ordinals BIP PR (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal Pull Request), which has been open for nine months without any clear response from the BIP editors. Casey has made several attempts to get feedback from the editors, including comments, direct messages, and emails, but has not received a response. 

Casey also acknowledges that there seems to be a misunderstanding about the BIP process. They clarify that BIPs, especially informational ones, are a form of technical documentation and their acceptance does not guarantee inclusion in any implementation, such as Bitcoin Core, nor does it imply consensus among the community. Casey provides examples of preexisting BIPs, which include hard-fork block size increases, proof-of-work changes, voting protocols, rejected soft fork proposals, encouragement of address reuse, and drivechain.

Despite this understanding, Casey believes that the Ordinals BIP is within the scope of a BIP and is seeking feedback from the BIP editors on whether it meets the criteria. They request clarification on whether it is in-scope and if not, the reasons behind it. Additionally, if the BIP is deemed in-scope, Casey asks for guidance on the changes required for its acceptance.

In conclusion, Casey Rodarmor expresses their frustration with the lack of response and seeks clarification and feedback from the BIP editors regarding the status and potential acceptance of the Ordinals BIP PR.</summary>
