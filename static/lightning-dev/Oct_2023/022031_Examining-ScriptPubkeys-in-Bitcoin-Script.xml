    <summary>In an email, the sender shares their exploration of the requirements to validate Taproot outputs in Bitcoin Script. They mention that such functionality is necessary for usable vaults. The sender provides a link to a blog post where they discuss this exploration in detail (https://rusty.ozlabs.org/2023/10/20/examining-scriptpubkey-in-script.html). They also invite others to collaborate on producing a prototype and debugging their script examples.

The sender summarizes their findings as follows: If OP_TX/OP_TXHASH or an equivalent way of pushing a scriptPubkey on the stack is available, and additional opcodes like OP_MULTISHA256 (or OP_CAT), OP_KEYADDTWEAK, OP_LESS (or OP_CONDSWAP) are added, along with a soft-fork to weaken the OP_SUCCESSx rule (or pop-script-from-stack), it becomes possible to prove a two-leaf tapscript tree in approximately 110 bytes of Script. This enables the implementation of useful spending constraints based on a template approach.

The email concludes with a thank you from Rusty, the sender.</summary>
