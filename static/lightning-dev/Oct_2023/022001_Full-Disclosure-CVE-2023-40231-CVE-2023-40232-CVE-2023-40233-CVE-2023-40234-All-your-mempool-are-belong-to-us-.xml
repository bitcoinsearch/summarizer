    <summary>The email discusses the two main ways of spending an "offered" HTLC txout. The first option involves a presigned multisig covenant transaction that pays to the offerer, also known as the HTLC-timeout transaction. This option can only be spent by the offerer since it uses a presigned covenant held by them. The second option requires the receiver's signature and the preimage. Only the receiver can spend via this path.

The email provides a link to the exact script used for these transactions, which can be found at https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.mdoffered-htlc-outputs.</summary>
