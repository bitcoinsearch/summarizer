    <summary>A recent email exchange among Bitcoin developers discussed the issue of wallet fingerprinting, specifically identifying the bitcoin wallet used to create a transaction. The discussion referenced previous research conducted by various individuals, including 0xB10C, achow101, and ishaanam. 

0xB10C's blog post from 2020 outlined several characteristics found in most transactions, such as following fee rate recommendations from Blockchain.com, using P2PKH outputs, having one or two outputs, using transaction version 1, and complying with BIP-69 standards. To address this issue, several suggested solutions were proposed: introducing randomness in fee rates, broadening the fingerprint by supporting different address types for receiving and spending, time-locking some transactions to the current block height, and setting a random transaction version when constructing transactions.

Achow101 created a tool in 2022 that focused on fingerprinting two specific wallets, Bitcoin Core and Electrum. While this tool served as a proof of concept, it was acknowledged that there are many other bitcoin wallets in use, and further improvement could be made by adding more fingerprints.

Ishaanam also wrote a recent blog post on wallet fingerprinting, categorizing fingerprints into four types: Independent, Probabilistic, Dependent, and Temporal. This post presented observations based on eight bitcoin wallets, including Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Blue Wallet, Exodus, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Trezor Suite, and Ledger Live. A table displaying the fingerprints was provided, along with a link to a Wallet Fingerprint Detector.

The conclusion drawn from the discussion was that while some fingerprints could be eliminated easily, completely eliminating fingerprinting would be challenging. It was noted that just because something is considered a fingerprint does not automatically mean it should not be done by a wallet. Certain modifications, such as changing the input order or change index of a wallet's transactions, should be implemented, while other actions like anti-fee-sniping and spending taproot UTXOs are still valuable.

In response to the issue, a spoofing tool was mentioned as a potential solution. This tool, currently in the form of a proof of concept, allows users to enter PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) and spoof its wallet fingerprint based on the selected option from a dropdown list. The tool supports nLocktime, nVersion, and BIP 69 ordering for two bitcoin wallets, Electrum and Blue Wallet. The email emphasized that this tool could be improved further if it proves useful to the community.

The rationale behind the need for such a tool lies in the fact that as protocol developers introduce changes that affect user privacy, identifying wallets based on transactions becomes easier. It was acknowledged that no two wallets would have the same fingerprint, and spoofing presents a viable solution for users who prioritize privacy. Drawing a comparison to browser fingerprinting, the email explained that while a browser fingerprint encompasses various elements like user agent, IP address, canvas fingerprint, etc., a wallet fingerprint for bitcoin transactions includes factors such as RBF signaling, transaction version, BIP 69 ordering, fee rate, change position, and type. The email suggested that if a tool can effectively spoof a browser fingerprint, the same concept could be applied to bitcoin transactions. The Tor browser was mentioned as an example of a tool that protects against fingerprinting by making all users' fingerprints the same, regardless of their device or operating system.

It was noted that existing tools attempting to identify wallets from transactions already result in many false positives, and the introduction of spoofing could potentially increase their prevalence. This increased uncertainty in identifying wallets can make chain analysis more difficult, ultimately enhancing privacy. The email suggested that some privacy-focused wallets may even consider implementing this feature within their wallets.

The email concluded by acknowledging the contributions and research done by individuals such as 0xB10C, achow101, ishaanam, pythcoiner, and statusquont. It was sent using Proton Mail secure email.</summary>
