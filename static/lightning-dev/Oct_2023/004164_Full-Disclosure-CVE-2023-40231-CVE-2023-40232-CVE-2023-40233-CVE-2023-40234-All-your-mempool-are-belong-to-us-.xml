    <summary>The email discusses the purpose of anchor outputs and questions their necessity beyond increasing fees. The sender mentions that if the full fee range has been pre-signed, there would be no need for anchor outputs. They argue that under any circumstance, a transaction with a sufficiently high fee can be broadcasted to ensure it gets mined.
