    <summary>Bitcoin Core v25.1, with Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, and some additional minor updates to it, is available on GitHub. This version of Bitcoin Core does two things for full-rbf nodes. Firstly, it advertises a FULL_RBF service bit when mempoolfullrbf=1 is set. Secondly, it connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. These updates ensure that a core group of nodes reliably propagates full-rbf replacements. While it is not necessary for everyone to run this version, it would be helpful if more people did. Running full-rbf provides benefits, which are explained in detail in Peter Todd's blog post titled "Why You Should Run Mempoolfullrbf," available at https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf.

Currently, at least 31% of hash power and 4 mining pools are using full-RBF. More information about the testing can be found at https://petertodd.org/2023/fullrbf-testing. As an interesting side note, there are even hats available related to this topic, as mentioned in a tweet by Peter Todd at https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1659996011086110720/photo/1.
