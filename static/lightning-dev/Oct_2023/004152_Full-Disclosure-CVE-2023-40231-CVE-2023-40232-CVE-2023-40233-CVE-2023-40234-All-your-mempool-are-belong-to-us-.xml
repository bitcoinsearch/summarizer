    <summary>In the email, Matt is discussing a problem related to nodes and mempool fees. He mentions that while some nodes already have a solution for this issue, it is not necessarily fixed if the victim has to spend more than the prevailing mempool fees. He also mentions the possibility of burning a large percentage of their HTLC value. 

It seems that Matt is responding to a previous email or conversation on this topic, but the details of that conversation are not provided in this email.</summary>
