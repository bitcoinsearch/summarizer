    <summary>Two recent updates to BIP324 ("Version 2 P2P Encrypted Transport Protocol") have been announced. These updates have both semantic changes and backwards-incompatible changes. Although there are currently no known implementations of BIP324 besides the one in Bitcoin Core, this email aims to inform those involved in other implementation efforts.

The first update, found in pull request 1496 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1496), includes several small changes. The detection of incoming v1 connections has been improved by considering the first 16 bytes instead of 12, which enhances accuracy. Additionally, if an incoming v1 connection appears to come from the wrong network, responders now have the ability to immediately drop the connection. Furthermore, the BIP330 message types have been removed from the short encodings list in the BIP, as it is not BIP324's goal to predict future protocol improvements.

The second update, introduced in pull request 1498 (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1498), brings a backwards-incompatible change. The garbage authentication packet has been merged with the version packet, simplifying the protocol implementation by consolidating states and eliminating the need for handling the special case of "ignoring the ignore bit." The removal of the garbage authentication packet also allows for easier testing and implementation since the freedom to choose its contents has been eliminated. Furthermore, some editorial improvements have been made to the BIP324 document.
