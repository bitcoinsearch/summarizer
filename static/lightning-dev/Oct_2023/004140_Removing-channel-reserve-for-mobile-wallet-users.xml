    <summary>The email discusses the process of public attribution in a wallet system. The sender explains how a wallet user can prove certain actions and information related to their wallet provider, specifically in the case of an old state being broadcasted. The sender outlines four points that can be proven by the user:1. A revocation happened: The user can point to the funding transaction output (txo) and the mined commitment transaction being spent via a revocation path.2. The user was one of the participants: This can be proven by signing with one of the multisig funding keys.3. The wallet provider (nodeid) was the other participant: If it was a public channel, the user can show the channel_announcement message. If it was an unannounced channel, the user most likely has a channel_update message for the incoming edge, signed by the wallet provider. However, this is not guaranteed, but often sent in practice.4. Identifying the cheating counterparty: The user can sign a message with the revocationpubkey visible onchain, which was used to spend from the old state. Additionally, the user could prove ownership of the txo created by the revocation, making point (2) redundant.The sender highlights the key insight in point 3/b, where the private channel_update can be shown. Overall, the email provides detailed information on how a wallet user can provide proof in various situations related to their wallet provider.</summary>
