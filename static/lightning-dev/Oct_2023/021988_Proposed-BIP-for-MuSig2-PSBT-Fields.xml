    <summary>I have received a BIP draft for MuSig2 PSBT fields from the sender. The draft can be viewed at this link: https://github.com/achow101/bips/blob/musig2-psbt/bip-musig2-psbt.mediawiki. The draft is based on a gist by Sanket, which can be found here: https://gist.github.com/sanket1729/4b525c6049f4d9e034d27368c49f28a6.

There are a few notable differences between the BIP draft and the gist. Firstly, the participant pubkeys field is now keyed by only the aggregate xonly key. Additionally, the participant pubkeys are compressed pubkeys instead of xonly.

This new BIP draft for MuSig2 PSBT fields seems to be an important development in the field. It will be interesting to see how it progresses and what impact it may have on future implementations.</summary>
