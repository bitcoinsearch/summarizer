    <summary>Peter Todd's email discusses the use of anchor outputs and pre-signed transactions in addressing issues with edge-cases and the fee-inflation attack in Bitcoin. By allowing the broadcaster to choose which transaction to broadcast, using pre-signed transactions can avoid reintroducing these issues. However, Todd expresses skepticism about the use of multiple pre-signed transactions due to increased fee overhead and the challenge of keeping track of various variants across different feerates. He believes that this is a policy bug that should be addressed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer rather than within the lightning world.</summary>
