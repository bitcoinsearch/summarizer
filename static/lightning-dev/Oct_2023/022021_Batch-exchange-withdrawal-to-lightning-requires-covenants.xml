    <summary>Participants in a transaction can indeed double-spend the batch using a commit tx spending from the previous funding output. It is important for participants to be aware of this possibility and not rely on 0-conf on that splice transaction. However, other than that, it functions as a regular splice. Participants need to be vigilant for double-spends while waiting for confirmations, as discussed in previous messages.

Regarding the suggestion to use nVersion=3 and pay 0 fees, the writer disagrees. They believe that this is a "standard" transaction and should instead use a reasonable feerate and nVersion=2. Therefore, they do not think the comment about using nVersion=3 and paying 0 fees applies in this case.

Cheers,
