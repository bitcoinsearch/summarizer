    <title>Removing channel reserve for mobile wallet users</title>

    <summary>The email discusses the main concern regarding the Lightning Service Providers (LSP) not keeping a reserve, which makes it easier for them to steal since the offline concern is on the mobile user. The lack of reliable watch tower integrations/products to mitigate this issue is also mentioned. The question arises on how a user can publish a previous commitment and whether this is something that should be solved for and exposed to users. The email includes a link to the dust reserves that still apply: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/4dcc377209509b13cf89a4b91fde7d478f5b46d8/02-peer-protocol.md?plain=1L304-L308</summary>
