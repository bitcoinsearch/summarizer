    <summary>The email begins with a greeting to Bastien and the list, expressing gratitude for their perspectives on a particular topic. The sender states their support for introducing the 0-channel reserve option into the protocol, suggesting it could be added via a Blip. They argue that while it makes sense to have this reserve when running a routing node, it would be beneficial to have the option to open zero-reserve channels. This idea has been mentioned in noderunner groups. They mention the need for a channel interceptor to restrict the acceptance of these channels, similar to the approach used for zero-conf channels. The sender also suggests including information on how to prove possible cheating attacks in the spec/blip, referencing a previous elaboration by SomberNight. They inquire if the issue regarding this behavior has already been reported.
