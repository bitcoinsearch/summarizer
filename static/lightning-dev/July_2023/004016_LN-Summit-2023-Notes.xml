    <summary>The proposal made in the Signal group after the summit suggests not using MuSig2 signing for commitment transactions. Instead, a tapscript branch consisting of `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG` should be added and used for unilateral closes. MuSig2 should only be used for mutual closes after negotiating closing fees. This approach eliminates the need for storing nonces in persistent storage and instead keeps them in volatile RAM. If a disconnection occurs, the nonces are removed from volatile RAM and the mutual close negotiation restarts upon reconnection. The goal is to have mutual closes dominate over unilateral closes. Conditional fees on the Lightning Network are already dynamic, so there is no reason for unconditional fees to be necessarily static. The subjective valuation of a "stereotypical" forwarding node is likely to be the most relevant. Deviations from the stereotypical forwarding node would determine how it differs from the typical one. The Bitcoin clock's coarse granularity, with chain height advances sometimes taking several hours, can cause problems. Halting channel progress could be considered a reason for reputation downgrade.</summary>
