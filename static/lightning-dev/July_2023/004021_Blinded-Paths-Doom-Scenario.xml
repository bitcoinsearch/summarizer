    <summary>The email discusses a scenario where the recipient provides blinded paths that go through "regulated" nodes to witness the payment. The sender questions why this would be dramatically different from the current situation. The sender suggests that since the recipient agrees to share data with these "regulated" nodes, payments don't necessarily have to go through them. The sender also points out that the sender's privacy is maintained by the hops before the introduction point, which can be freely chosen. The sender states that this model is similar to freely choosing hops to the recipient directly without using blinded paths. The only difference seems to be the loss of potential payment routes for the recipient.</summary>
