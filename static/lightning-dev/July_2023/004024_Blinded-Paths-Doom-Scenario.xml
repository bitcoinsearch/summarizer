    <summary>When a payment is being routed, each node added to the blinded route increases the chance that a user is closer to one of them without realizing. If the sender's first hop happens to be one of the nodes in the blinded route, it compromises the privacy they were trying to achieve. However, it is unclear how this would expose the sender's identity. Even if the sender is close to one of the regulated nodes, it does not enable them to learn who the actual sender is. The system still uses Sphinx, so intermediate nodes cannot determine their proximity to the sender or even if they are the first hop. Any heuristic used to infer this can be overcome.</summary>
