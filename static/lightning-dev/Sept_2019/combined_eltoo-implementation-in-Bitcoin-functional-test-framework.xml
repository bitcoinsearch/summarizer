    <summary>Richard Myers, a member of the Lightning development community, has implemented the eltoo update scheme in the Bitcoin functional test framework. His goal is to better understand and refine the Bitcoin scripts and message passing protocol for eltoo. The implementation allows for exploring the data flow between nodes that use eltoo to update their channel state. These tests serve as a framework for both understanding and refining the Bitcoin scripts and message passing protocol for eltoo.In an email exchange, Bastien from Acinq raised a question about the use of miniscript for lightning and how it could be more future-proof and extensible than directly using Bitcoin script. Richard replied, mentioning his implementation of the eltoo update scheme and the simulations he created. He is interested in finding other eltoo implementations to compare notes and work towards a detailed specification.The simulation uses a fork of Bitcoin with cdeckerâ€™s SIGHASH_NOINPUT patch applied to the signet2 fork fjahr, which has patches applied for signet, taproot, and anyprevout*. Richard's next steps include adding bidirectional channel updates and deriving public keys for settle transactions from a pre-shared basepoint.Richard extends special thanks to the Chaincode Summer Residency and Christian Decker for their helpful advice and encouragement during his work on this project. The link to Richard's implementation can be found on GitHub.</summary>
