    <summary>The email exchange discusses a proposal for automated inbound liquidity on the Lightning Network. The proposal suggests embedding the node URI of the invoice creator in the invoice itself, along with the amount to be routed. This would allow routing nodes to automatically establish channels and push payments, enabling users to receive payments instantly. However, this feature would only be available for routing nodes and not all Lightning Network nodes. Considerations such as the size of the channel and charging a premium fee by routing nodes who provide this service are important factors to take into account.Another user suggests a practical way to set up incoming liquidity by creating a channel to a high-uptime node on the network using on-chain funds. They propose using a submarine swap to buy on-chain funds and then reusing the same funds to make more liquidity until the submarine swap provider runs out of on-chain funds. This method provides control over which nodes to make channels with and is considered a good investment in future accessibility over the Lightning Network. However, it requires having capital in some form before starting a business.ZmnSCPxj shares insights on just-in-time routing, which allows routing nodes to implement routing payments "just in time" even without pre-existing routes to the destination. However, there are challenges in implementing this approach, such as dealing with the onion route format and ensuring proper timing of the final HTLC. To overcome these challenges, trampoline routing is suggested as a solution. Trampoline routing involves indicating the node ID of the next trampoline hop, eliminating the need for implementations to remember previous connections.Overall, the proposals aim to improve user experience and offer solutions for instant payment transactions and automated inbound liquidity on the Lightning Network. However, further infrastructure development and specific details need to be addressed for successful implementation.</summary>
