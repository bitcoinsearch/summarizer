    <summary>The phenomenon of spy nodes within the peer-to-peer (P2P) network has garnered attention due to their minimal data exchange with other nodes. These nodes typically engage in a limited interaction, completing only the P2P handshake and responding to ping messages without participating in regular connection activities. This behavior is characterized by an unusually low traffic volume - around 1MB - which is significantly less than what is observed through outbound connections, indicating that these nodes do not partake in the standard data exchange processes. 

There is an ongoing discussion about strategies to address the presence of spy nodes within the network. One such proposed solution can be found in a GitHub pull request ([#29415](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29415)). The implementation of this proposal across a majority of nodes could potentially mitigate the activities of spy nodes by disincentivizing their passive participation in the network. This change aims to foster a more secure and efficient network environment by encouraging active and meaningful exchanges among all nodes.</summary>
