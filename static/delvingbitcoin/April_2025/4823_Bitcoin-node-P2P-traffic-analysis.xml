    <summary>The skepticism surrounding the effectiveness of privacy-enhancing technologies is rooted in their complexity and the necessity for additional installation and configuration, which may deter widespread adoption. Despite the potential benefits, the entities that monitor network activities and sell the collected data might not be significantly impacted unless such technologies become universally utilized. Moreover, the customers purchasing this data may only consider it worthless if it becomes entirely ineffective, a scenario unlikely to occur unless these privacy measures are adopted on a massive scale. Nonetheless, the argument posits that the incremental improvements in privacy these technologies offer are valuable in and of themselves, even if they do not completely halt network abuse. This perspective highlights the nuanced balance between the practical challenges of implementing robust privacy solutions and their intrinsic value in enhancing user privacy.</summary>
