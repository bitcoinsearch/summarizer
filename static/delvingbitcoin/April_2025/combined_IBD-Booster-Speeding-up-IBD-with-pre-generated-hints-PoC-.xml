    <summary>The exploration and innovation in optimizing Bitcoin's Initial Block Download (IBD) phase have led to significant insights and proposals that could reshape the efficiency of blockchain validation processes. A notable flaw was identified in the current hints data format used for compressing information, where the output count of each block is stored as a 2-byte sequence. This approach limits the count to 65,535, which, although higher than the current mainnet maximum, is insufficient when considering the potential for blocks with much greater numbers of outputs. The suggestion to adopt a variable-length encoding for the output count or possibly eliminating the need for it altogether by not dividing outputs into blocks was presented as a solution to optimize data storage and processing efficiency.

An innovative approach dubbed "SwiftSync" has been developed to significantly accelerate the initial benchmark speed without relying on parallel block validation. This method challenges the necessity of "assumevalid" and introduces an alternative validation technique that incorporates all UTXO set data into the hash for comprehensive verification. Furthermore, SwiftSync proposes using a regular hash function combined with modular arithmetic and a salt to enhance security against birthday attacks, offering a more streamlined and potentially faster validation process compared to MuHash.

In an effort to streamline the IBD phase, a concept known as the "IBD Booster" has been proposed, leveraging pre-generated hints to minimize chainstate operations. By selectively adding coins to the UTXO set based on their projected unspent status at a specific block height, this strategy aims to eliminate unnecessary UTXO set lookups and removals, thereby reducing the demand on computing resources and storage. The implementation of this idea involves the generation of a bit-encoded hints file, indicating whether each transaction output will remain unspent at a future block height, thus allowing for a more efficient block validation process that could even be executed in parallel.

A proof-of-concept for the IBD Booster has been created, consisting of a Python script for generating the hints file and a modified Bitcoin Core branch capable of utilizing these hints for optimization. Initial benchmarks on a low-performance VPS have shown a promising speedup of approximately 2.24 times compared to traditional methods. Despite its potential, the IBD Booster approach currently faces limitations, such as the inability to create undo data, which restricts the functionality of the resulting node. However, this initiative opens up avenues for further research and development towards enhancing the scalability and performance of blockchain technology.
