    <summary>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 342 (BIP 342) introduces significant updates and rules for Bitcoin's scripting system. A crucial aspect of BIP 342 is how it handles `OP_SUCCESSx` opcodes within tapscript. Contrary to the belief that an `OP_SUCCESSx` opcode must be executed for a script to succeed, the mere presence of any `OP_SUCCESSx` opcode in a tapscript automatically leads to the script evaluating as true. This highlights a nuanced yet vital part of the protocol that emphasizes the automatic success of scripts containing these opcodes, regardless of execution. The proposal suggests a strategic approach to script design, specifically advocating for the separation of script branches into individual script leaves. This method optimizes the functionality and effectiveness of the scripting system under the new rules introduced by BIP 342. For further details, the full text and specifications can be found in the official [BIP 342 documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/757e15e56883b754963dff732dde01a425f9cec6/bip-0342.mediawiki).</summary>
