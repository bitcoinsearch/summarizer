    <summary>In an innovative approach to enhance the success rate of payments in a network, the introduction of a query message for obtaining paths from peers has been proposed as a viable solution. This method stands out by allowing each hop in the payment process to communicate feasible outbound channel sets to the requester without disclosing any specific channel balances. Such a mechanism not only increases the probability of successful transactions but also affords nodes the flexibility to modify their routing policies, including fees, on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This adaptability ensures a more controlled and efficient management of liquidity flow across the network.

The concept, detailed further in a [previous post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/revisiting-pathfinding/1503), marks a significant departure from conventional practices where information about liquidity is often exchanged through less reliable means, such as gossip. By implementing a query-based system for path discovery, the network can achieve a higher degree of payment success with improved privacy and efficiency in liquidity management. The potential benefits of this approach are considerable, offering a straightforward yet effective solution to several persistent challenges within the existing framework.

Moreover, the proposal to follow up with a comprehensive analysis that includes both implementation strategies and a cost-benefit examination underscores the practicality of this solution. It suggests a thoughtful consideration of the implications and a thorough exploration of how such a system could be integrated into current networks. This forward-thinking approach not only addresses immediate issues but also paves the way for future enhancements in network performance and user experience.</summary>
