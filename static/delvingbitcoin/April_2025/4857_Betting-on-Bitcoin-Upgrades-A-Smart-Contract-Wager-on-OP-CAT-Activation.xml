    <summary>In the realm of programming, particularly when dealing with script execution in blockchain technology, understanding the functionality and implications of specific operations is crucial. The success of a script is contingent upon its execution rather than its mere presence in the code. This principle is exemplified through the use of `OP_SUCCESSx` operations, such as `OP_SUCCESS126`. For an operation like `OP_SUCCESS126`, which is designated to make a script succeed immediately upon execution, its effect is only realized if it is actively run within the script's logic flow. 

A practical illustration of this concept can be observed in a conditional script scenario. If a script is evaluated with an `OP_FALSE` condition leading to an `OP_IF` branch that contains `OP_SUCCESS3`, the script will not automatically succeed by the mere inclusion of `OP_SUCCESS3`. Instead, the alternative `OP_ELSE` branch is executed, assuming it does not meet the condition for `OP_IF`. For example, consider the following script structure: 

```
OP_FALSE 
OP_IF 
  OP_SUCCESS3 
OP_ELSE 
  OP_CHECKSIG 
OP_ENDIF
```

In this case, the success of the script hinges on the execution path determined by conditional logic, not just the presence of a potentially successful operation like `OP_SUCCESS3`.

Further complicating matters is the conditional execution based on user-specific conditions. In a hypothetical scenario where the script includes a branching condition at Line 16 designed for user Bob, it ensures that `OP_SUCCESS126` (or any similar operation) can only lead to success if certain criteria are met – specifically, those that pertain to Bob's interaction with the script. This means Alice, or any other user lacking the necessary conditions, cannot trigger `OP_SUCCESS126` to achieve success. Such conditional execution emphasizes the importance of understanding both the structural and logical aspects of scripting in blockchain technologies, ensuring that operations like `OP_SUCCESS126` serve their intended purpose under the right circumstances.</summary>
