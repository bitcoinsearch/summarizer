    <summary>The proposal mentioned by @ZmnSCPxj, known as the Forwardable Peerswaps proposal, introduces an innovative method for optimizing on-chain swaps by leveraging the concept of "forwarding" these swaps from nodes that are net senders of liquidity to those that are net receivers. This approach aims to enhance the rebalancing process by extending it beyond a single channel, allowing for a more comprehensive replenishment of liquidity across multiple channels simultaneously. Each node participating in this system stands to gain from the more efficient distribution of liquidity, suggesting that this model could significantly improve the dynamics of channel management and liquidity provision within the network. The idea is presented as a potentially valuable addition to discussions on optimizing liquidity management and has been detailed in the provided [link](https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin/bitcoin-dev/linuxfoundation-pipermail/lightning-dev/2022-October/003710.txt), which outlines the mechanics and benefits of the proposed system.</summary>
