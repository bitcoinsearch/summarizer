    <summary>The discussion centers on the strategy for prefilling transactions in a blockchain network, specifically focusing on two types: transactions that were explicitly requested and those taken from an extra pool of transactions. The person raises a point of confusion regarding the rationale behind including transactions from this extra pool in the prefill process. The underlying logic is questioned on the basis that if all nodes adhere to the same criteria for selecting transactions for their extra pool, it would be reasonable to assume that these transactions are already present in the mempools of peer nodes. This assumption implies that there might be redundancy in prefilling transactions from the extra pool since peers are likely to share similar sets of transactions. The discussion implies a deeper exploration of the efficiency and necessity of including transactions from the extra pool in the prefill process, suggesting a reconsideration of whether this approach optimizes network resources and transaction propagation or merely adds unnecessary complexity and redundancy.</summary>
