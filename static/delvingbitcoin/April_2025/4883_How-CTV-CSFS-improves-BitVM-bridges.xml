    <summary>A sighash group, as discussed, cannot straightforwardly address the issue at hand due to the requirement for an interactive setup for its construction. This necessity arises unless APO-semantics or an alternative solution is employed. The complexity of the situation is further highlighted by the fact that while one party (A) can commit to another (B), the reverse commitment from B to A is not facilitated, even when additional opcodes are considered. This delineates a significant limitation within the current framework, underscoring the need for a more nuanced approach or the incorporation of new semantics to effectively manage commitments between parties.</summary>
