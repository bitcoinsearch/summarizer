    <summary>The discussed scheme suggests that the end-of-window time increases by a predetermined amount, $P$, for each block produced. This mechanism ensures that the real-time block production rate remains consistent with the intended rate, addressing potential concerns regarding the efficiency and functionality of blockchain systems. From the perspective of validating nodes within the network, this approach effectively mitigates the risk of resource consumption attacks. Such attacks typically aim to overwhelm the system with excessive demands on computational resources, but by maintaining a constant block production rate, the system's resilience is significantly enhanced.

Moreover, the scheme allows miners the flexibility to adjust the difficulty of their mining efforts without altering the overall block production rate. This aspect of the scheme recognizes the inherent ability of miners to coordinate among themselves to influence the network's difficulty level. By agreeing to collectively reduce their hashrate, miners can effectively lower the difficulty level. However, this strategy also introduces a vulnerability. It creates an opportunity for competing miners who do not participate in the hashrate reduction agreement to potentially gain a disproportionate advantage. These non-colluding miners may find it easier and less costly to contribute blocks to the network, thereby increasing their chances of taking over. This dynamic underscores the delicate balance between collaboration among miners to manage difficulty levels and the competitive nature of mining activities.</summary>
