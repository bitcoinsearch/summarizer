    <summary>The discussion revolves around a nuanced approach to handling block templates in a decentralized network context, particularly focusing on the inherent trade-offs without necessitating an additional peer-to-peer (p2p) message or uniform policy adherence across nodes. The default setting for nodes is to allow a maximum of 125 connections, which implicitly acknowledges the expectation of divergent mempool policies within a decentralized framework. This divergence may stem from various sources, including but not limited to policy differences themselves or other unspecified factors.

The introduction of an extra pool for block reconstruction is recognized as beneficial, especially in mitigating issues arising from variance in mempool due to policy divergence or other reasons. However, it's highlighted that discussing this feature in the context of deliberately impairing the relay of certain transaction classes across the P2P network misses the mark. Such an approach would inherently undermine the effectiveness of the extra pool since it relies on transactions propagating successfully to function as intended. Therefore, if the propagation of specific transactions is intentionally compromised, expecting the extra pool to compensate for this disruption is deemed inconsistent with the foundational goal of enhancing transaction relay reliability.
