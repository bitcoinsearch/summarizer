    <summary>The discussion revolves around the assertion that economic actors are expected to gravitate towards a finite-supply, inert, fungible, digital asset as a measure of relative wealth, encapsulating all other forms of economic utility. This statement is critiqued for presuming its conclusion from the outset without adhering to the principles of game theory or logical reasoning. The critique highlights a misalignment with the foundational theories of John Nash and Friedrich Hayek concerning game theory and economic philosophy. Specifically, it points out that the assertion contradicts Nash's and Hayek's conclusions, questioning the application of "game-theoretic" rationale in this context. The critique underscores a misunderstanding or misapplication of game theory and economic reasoning, suggesting that the initial claim lacks the empirical and theoretical support traditionally associated with these intellectual frameworks.</summary>
