    <summary>In the inquiry about changes to the handling of the chainstate in recent updates, a significant observation has been made regarding the size difference in gigabytes of the chainstate directory. This change is notably different from previous versions where such rapid fluctuations in the size of the chainstate directory were not observed. To substantiate this observation, a comparison between disk usage statistics before and after the upgrade has been suggested. The disk usage (`du`) lines from before the upgrade can be found archived at [https://web.archive.org/web/20251009055032/https://ln.anyone.eu.org/bitcoin.txt](https://web.archive.org/web/20251009055032/https://ln.anyone.eu.org/bitcoin.txt), while the current statistics are available directly at [https://anyone.eu.org/bitcoin.txt](https://anyone.eu.org/bitcoin.txt). This comparison aims to highlight the alterations in disk space utilization attributed to the chainstate management, which may not have been explicitly mentioned in the release notes.</summary>
