    <summary>The 2021 Taproot upgrade in Bitcoin introduced a significant advancement with the implementation of degraded multisignature, which allows for more efficient and private use of multisignature schemes. This development is particularly important as threshold signatures become increasingly common for securing Bitcoin funds. These schemes require a minimum number of signatures to authorize transactions, raising questions about the optimal threshold that balances security against usability.

Threshold signature schemes operate on the principle that requiring more signatures for a transaction increases security by making it harder for attackers to access funds but also risks locking legitimate users out of their own assets. The challenge lies in finding an optimal threshold that minimizes expected loss, which includes both the risk of attack and the risk of self-lockout. Enhancing security measures or usability can allow for higher thresholds by either decreasing the chance of an attack or reducing the likelihood of user lockout, respectively.

An interesting aspect of this analysis is the introduction of dynamic models that account for changing conditions over time. One model suggests starting with higher thresholds and gradually lowering them while extending timelocks, accommodating the natural decay in both user and attacker access probabilities. Another model considers scenarios where user access decays over time, but attacker access might increase, suggesting an adjustment of thresholds based on these dynamics.

These findings underline the importance of degraded multisignature schemes enabled by Taproot, offering a framework for setting thresholds and timelocks that evolve over time. This approach not only caters to the static nature of threats but adapts to changing circumstances, ensuring optimal security and usability throughout the lifecycle of Bitcoin holdings.

Moreover, the research highlights the potential of Taproot to unlock new possibilities for economic transactions through its support for complex contracts, including taptrees and second-layer protocols. This opens avenues for future exploration, particularly in how artificial intelligence agents might utilize Bitcoin Script and threshold signatures to facilitate transactions.

For those interested in deeper insights into the mathematics and simulations behind these conclusions, the source code and further details are available on Github at [this link](https://github.com/sindurasaraswathi/Optimal_Threshold_Signatures). This work not only contributes to the understanding of optimal threshold signature schemes but also points to the broader implications and opportunities presented by the Taproot upgrade for Bitcoin's future.</summary>
