    <summary>The discussion revolves around the skepticism towards metaprotocols despite acknowledging the validity of presented arguments regarding risk mitigation and market-driven adoption. A specific counterpoint is raised with the mention of Starknet, an L2 solution built on STARK proofs, highlighting its proven track record in production. Starknet has successfully processed close to a billion transactions and secured over $1 trillion in cumulative volume. This example is used to illustrate that, although not implemented on Bitcoin, the technical feasibility and security of such a system are already evidenced in practice. The correspondent underscores the point by contrasting the theoretical security concerns of metaprotocols with Starknetâ€™s empirical achievements, suggesting that a meta protocol could be considered less secure in comparison to the established success of technologies like Starknet. This perspective provides a nuanced view on the debate, emphasizing the importance of real-world applications and results over theoretical models.</summary>
