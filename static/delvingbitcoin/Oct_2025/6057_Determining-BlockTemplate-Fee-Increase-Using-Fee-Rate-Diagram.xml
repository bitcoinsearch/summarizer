    <summary>The discussion centers on a technical improvement that enhances the efficiency of handling transactions by eliminating the necessity to keep track of removed data segments. This approach is notably praised for its ability to operate independently from the mempool and `txgraph`, which is crucial for reducing computational demands. Specifically, the method avoids increasing the computational load each time changes are committed to the txgraph main or when there are modifications in the lower or upper bounds. This innovation is aimed at streamlining operations and optimizing performance within the system, ensuring smoother and more efficient transaction processing.</summary>
