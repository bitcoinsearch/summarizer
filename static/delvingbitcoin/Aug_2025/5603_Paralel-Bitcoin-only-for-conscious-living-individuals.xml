    <summary>In discussing the approach to a parallel Bitcoin system, an emphasis on decentralization is paramount, extending beyond just the distribution of the network's nodes to the very holdings within individual wallets. A suggested guideline proposes limiting the maximum amount a wallet can hold to 10 to 20 times the average global holding. This idea stems from the belief that avoiding hyper-concentration of wealth is crucial for maintaining a dynamic economy. The argument posits that society does not benefit from accumulating wealth in the hands of a few but rather from ensuring money circulates widely. Money, as argued, should not be viewed merely as a status symbol or end goal but as a facilitator of economic activity and dynamism. This perspective underscores the importance of using monetary policy not just for the sake of wealth accumulation but as a tool to foster broader economic engagement and health.</summary>
