    <summary>The discussion revolves around the misunderstanding related to variance comments concerning experimental results on hashing estimates. The standard deviation of these estimates is highlighted, particularly in relation to the number of hashes (n) and is shown to be proportional to \(n / \sqrt{b}\) and \(n / \sqrt{k-1}\). This relationship suggests that as the variables \(b\) and \(k\) decrease in value, the error associated with these estimates increases. The expectation, based on the assumption that "the \(k\)th lowest is like the target that the \(k-1\)th lowest solved," is for these two expressions of standard deviation to align. This points towards a theoretical framework where the comparison between consecutive hash targets can provide insight into the variability and reliability of hash-related computations.</summary>
