    <summary>The discussion revolves around the commonly asked query during the onboarding process for Liana, specifically regarding the extension of the timelock feature beyond its current 15-month limit. The suggestion to extend this duration to a significantly longer period, such as 5 or even 10 years, stems from a desire to address several user experience (UX) challenges that have been identified. This proposed extension is seen as a potential solution to improve the platform's alignment with users' long-term custody and inheritance planning needs. The emphasis on extending the timelock feature highlights the importance of adapting the platform to better meet the evolving demands and expectations of its user base, particularly in areas critical to personal and financial security.</summary>
