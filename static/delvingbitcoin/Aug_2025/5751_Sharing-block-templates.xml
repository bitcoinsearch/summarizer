    <summary>The concept of the extrapool plays a significant role in addressing the issue of "one hop divergence" within a system, particularly if its size is adequately large. This implies that the extrapool has the potential to mitigate or even solve the problems associated with one hop divergence, suggesting its effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, it's noted that a single hop may not be sufficient for overcoming all challenges, indicating that while the extrapool contributes to solving this issue, it might not be a complete solution on its own.

Furthermore, the difficulty in providing concrete measurements regarding the effectiveness of the extrapool is highlighted, especially in the context of policy divergence related to minimum fees. The presence of fee filters complicates the ability of the extrapool to fully address these divergences, pointing to limitations in its capability to manage policy-related discrepancies effectively. This suggests that while the extrapool serves as a valuable tool in managing one hop divergence, its effectiveness is influenced by external factors such as fee filters, which can hinder its performance in certain situations.</summary>
