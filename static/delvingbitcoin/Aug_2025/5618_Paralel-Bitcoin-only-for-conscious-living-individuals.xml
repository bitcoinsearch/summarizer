    <summary>The concern raised addresses the pivotal issue of decentralization within the realm of Bitcoin and its susceptibility to control by Western oligarchies. The argument posits that regardless of Bitcoin's market performance, whether it experiences a decline or an incline, the ultimate beneficiaries appear to be the established financial institutions and potentially Satoshi Nakamoto, who is speculated to have affiliations with these entities. This situation presents a paradox in the fundamental principle of decentralization that Bitcoin purports to champion. The narrative suggests that without creating a fork of Bitcoin that explicitly excludes institutional participation, the vision of a truly decentralized financial system remains unattainable. This reflection underscores a critical crossroad in the evolution of cryptocurrencies, hinting at the necessity for strategic interventions to preserve the ethos of decentralization against the backdrop of increasing institutional involvement.</summary>
