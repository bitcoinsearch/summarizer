    <summary>In the quest for optimizing encrypted payload sizes, a notable suggestion involves the utilization of a specific library found at [Josh Doman's GitHub](https://github.com/joshdoman/descriptor-codec). This library is poised to potentially revolutionize the way encrypted payloads are managed by introducing more efficient compression techniques. A particularly intriguing strategy for further enhancing this efficiency is the examination and elimination of duplicate extended public keys (xpubs) that are followed by different derivation paths. This method suggests an additional layer of optimization could be achieved by identifying redundancies within the data structure, thereby not only preserving the integrity of the information but also significantly reducing the overall size of the encrypted payload. Such advancements could mark a pivotal moment in the realm of data encryption, offering both improved security and efficiency.</summary>
