    <title>Solutions for this new centralization INSIDE Bitcoin?</title>

    <summary>The topic under discussion revolves around the growing centralization within Bitcoin, mirroring the existing centralization seen in fiat currencies. This concern arises particularly after institutions have started to engage more deeply with Bitcoin, which contradicts the cryptocurrency's foundational ethos of decentralization. A specific instance cited is a [rejected proposal](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/paralel-bitcoin-only-for-conscious-living-individuals/1877/1) by the author, aimed at addressing this issue but was not accepted by the community or platform it was proposed on.

The crux of the matter lies in identifying and implementing potential solutions that can counteract or entirely eliminate the influence of institutional and oligarchic centralization on Bitcoin. The author seeks insights or suggestions on mechanisms or frameworks that could safeguard Bitcoin's decentralized nature, ensuring it remains accessible and equitable for individual users rather than being dominated by large entities or institutions. 

This discussion is critical as it touches on the fundamental principles of Bitcoin and the broader vision of cryptocurrencies as tools for financial independence and resistance against centralized control. The challenge is to find viable strategies that can preserve these ideals in the face of growing interest and participation from institutional players, which traditionally embody the centralized financial systems that cryptocurrencies seek to transcend.</summary>
