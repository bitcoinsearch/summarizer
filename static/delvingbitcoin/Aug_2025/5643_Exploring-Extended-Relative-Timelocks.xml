    <summary>Lightning Network's method of employing bits for storing obfuscated commitment transaction numbers is a nuanced aspect, as detailed within BOLT 03. This approach, while not widely discussed, demonstrates the technical intricacies underlying Lightning transactions. The suggestion for Lightning developers to propose a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) akin to [BIP320](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/3e15178a43cf36f6e242bc3ff8caa659f22acb1c/bip-0320.mediawiki) to formally document this mechanism highlights the need for broader visibility and standardization of such practices within the cryptocurrency community. The reference to this method being "buried" in the documentation indicates that important technical details may often be overlooked or underappreciated by those not deeply involved in protocol specifics. By opening a BIP, Lightning Network's developers would not only clarify the procedure for a wider audience but also contribute to the structured evolution of Bitcoin's technological framework.</summary>
