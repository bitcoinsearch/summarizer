    <summary>The correspondence raises an important consideration regarding the size of compiled bytecode in practical applications, specifically in relation to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The underlying question is whether the size of the resulting compiled bytecode is minimal enough to justify its inclusion over simply overpaying the fee required for auto-bumping code. This inquiry suggests that if the bytecode is not sufficiently small, it may be more economical to exclude it altogether and instead opt to overcompensate the fee associated with the auto-bumping functionality. This perspective emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of the trade-offs between incorporating certain pieces of code based on their compiled size and the potential financial impacts of those decisions.</summary>
