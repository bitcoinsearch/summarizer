    <summary>The discussion revolves around a refined method for calculating network statistics, specifically highlighting the formula ```sum(work in window) / (window duration)```. This approach is praised for its accuracy and relevance, even in scenarios where there are fluctuations in difficulty and hashrate within a given time window. The suggestion extends to enhancing the ```getnetworkhashps``` function by integrating an option to select a time range in addition to a block range. This proposed update aims at providing a more precise and useful measurement of network performance over specified periods, accommodating changes in mining activity and network difficulty. The emphasis on this calculation method points to an ongoing effort to improve analytical tools and metrics used within network analysis, ensuring they reflect more dynamic and real-time conditions.</summary>
