    <summary>The message provides an update on a recent change that the sender has implemented, with a link to the specific alteration detailed on GitHub ([here's what it looks like](https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/pull/26)). The sender is addressing Steven Roose directly, indicating that if Roose finds the changes acceptable and agrees to merge them, the sender requests acknowledgment in the relevant Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) discussion thread.
