    <summary>The process of activating new consensus rules in cryptocurrency mining involves gaining substantial support from a large base of miners. This collective backing is crucial as it ensures transactions that violate the new regulations cannot be mined, maintaining the integrity and stability of the network. The implementation of these rules often includes technical adjustments, such as utilizing a different bit in the sequence field of transactions. This specific change is designed to prevent confusion among older nodes within the network; older nodes, which are not updated to recognize these new rules, will interpret the sequence value differently. Specifically, they will not confuse it with the existing relative timelock rules, which is an essential aspect of ensuring backward compatibility and smooth operation across different versions of the network software. This approach underscores the meticulous planning and consideration that goes into evolving the consensus mechanisms of blockchain networks, ensuring they remain secure, functional, and inclusive of all participants regardless of their software version.</summary>
