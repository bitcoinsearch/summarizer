    <summary>The correction of a significant error where 'D' and 'W' were inverted in a PDF document has been addressed, leading to numerous corrections. This mistake had previously resulted in multiple errors throughout the document, but through diligent review and amendment, these have now been rectified. The process involved identifying where the mix-up occurred and systematically going through the document to correct each instance. This step was crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the information presented within the PDF, as such errors could potentially mislead readers or result in incorrect implementations of the instructions or data it contained.</summary>
