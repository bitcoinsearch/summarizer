    <summary>The discussion revolves around a scenario in which an attacker aims to jam a communication channel between two points, A and B, by controlling intermediary points M1 and M2. In this setup, the channel comprises 120 slots. To successfully jam the channel for a duration of two weeks, the estimated cost for the attacker is calculated to be approximately 8,000 satoshis (sats), based on a rate of 67.2 sats per slot. 

A question arises regarding whether the cost implications for the attacker change when the value of the payments being sent is minimal, specifically only 1 sat. This scenario prompts an inquiry into the necessity for the attacker to lock in a proportionate amount of funds, equivalent to 0.8 sats, to maintain the jamming operation under these conditions. The underlying mechanics of how the attack's economics are influenced by the nominal value of the transactions involved are at the core of this examination.</summary>
