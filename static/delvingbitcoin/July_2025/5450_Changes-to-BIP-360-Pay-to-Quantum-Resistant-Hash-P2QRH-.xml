    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of post-quantum cryptography within a specific technology infrastructure, suggesting an approach that involves adding it as opcodes. This strategy leads to a recommendation for renaming the proposed soft-fork, previously known as p2qrh, to either pay-to-tapscript (p2ts) or pay-to-mast. The rationale behind this suggestion is that the terminology "quantum-specific" does not accurately represent the broader applicability and demand for the feature across different segments of the ecosystem. The emphasis is on acknowledging the wider interest and utility of the proposed feature beyond just its quantum resistance capabilities. It highlights the need for a nomenclature that reflects the multi-faceted appeal and potential usage of the feature in question, advocating for a name that encapsulates its broader significance and application within the ecosystem.</summary>
