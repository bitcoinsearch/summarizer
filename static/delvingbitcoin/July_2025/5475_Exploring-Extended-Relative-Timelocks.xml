    <summary>In the discussion regarding blockchain timelocks, a significant point was raised about the potential implementation of 8 block units following the initial 65535 blocks. The primary concern associated with this approach revolves around the complexity it introduces by necessitating the management of two distinct types of timelocks: long and short. This added complexity is viewed unfavorably because it enlarges the surface area for potential bugs within the system. Moreover, there is an underlying belief that users will not value the granularity provided by sub-8 block distinctions in such constructions, suggesting that the benefits of implementing this method may not outweigh the risks and complications. This perspective highlights the need for simplicity and reliability in blockchain functionalities, prioritizing user experience and system robustness over intricate technical enhancements that might not offer significant practical advantages.</summary>
