    <summary>Per-hop blinding is a concept that enhances privacy in transactions by using a method where each hop in a transaction chain has its unique constant, known only to the current node and the initiating party. This approach employs inbound and outbound values, labeled `R1` and `R2` respectively, with `R2` being derived from `R1` by adding a product of the per-hop constant `k` and a public key `G`. This technique allows for the secure claiming of inbound funds by recalculating `r1` from `r2` using the known constant `k`, effectively enabling the node to claim the funds without directly linking the inbound and outbound values on the blockchain. The essential feature of this method is its ability to maintain transactional privacy by not requiring the direct relation of inbound and outbound values (`r1/r2` or `R1/R2`) on the public ledger, thus preserving the anonymity of the transaction paths while still ensuring the integrity and claimability of the funds. This process underscores the importance of privacy in digital transactions, providing a mechanism to secure payments while protecting the identities and relationships of the involved parties.</summary>
