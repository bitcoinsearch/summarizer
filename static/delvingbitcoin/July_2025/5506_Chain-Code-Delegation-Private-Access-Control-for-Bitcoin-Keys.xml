    <summary>This discussion highlights the concept similar to blinded extended public keys (xpubs), as seen on [GitHub](https://github.com/mflaxman/blind-xpub). It points out a significant advancement in minimizing potential security risks or the "blast radius" associated with revealing the blinded path for an xpub. Once this path is disclosed, any subsequent use of keys derived from this xpub becomes visible to the custodian, which is considered a noteworthy improvement in maintaining privacy and security in cryptographic operations. This mechanism presents an innovative approach to enhancing the confidentiality and oversight of extended public key usage, thereby offering a cooler and potentially safer method for managing and tracking the utilization of xpub derived keys.</summary>
