    <summary>The discussion revolves around the management of two types of timelocks, long and short, and the implications this has on increasing the potential for bugs. The perspective offered suggests a preference towards simplifying the system by deprecating the old timelock mechanism in favor of a new one, under the assumption that users will not be concerned with the details finer than sub-8 block granularity. This approach is considered bold yet not unreasonable, indicating a strategic move towards system simplification while weighing the trade-offs between complexity and user needs. The conversation hints at a forward-thinking approach to system design, prioritizing ease of use and system robustness over maintaining legacy features that may no longer serve the majority of user requirements effectively.</summary>
