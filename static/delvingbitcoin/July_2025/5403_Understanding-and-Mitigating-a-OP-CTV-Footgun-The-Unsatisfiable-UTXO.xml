    <summary>When requiring an additional input for a transaction, it introduces not only extra costs but also the challenge of creating this input with the precise amount needed. This intricacy arises from the necessity to free up the committed transaction (tx) without incurring excessive fees. Furthermore, engaging two inputs within a transaction disturbs the stability of the transaction id. This instability has significant implications, particularly precluding certain use-cases. For example, it becomes impractical to establish connector or control outputs through these transactions due to the fluctuating nature of the transaction id. This complexity underscores the intricate balance required in managing transaction inputs and their impact on transaction stability and utility.</summary>
