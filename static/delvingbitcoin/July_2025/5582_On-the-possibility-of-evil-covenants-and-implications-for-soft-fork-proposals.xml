    <summary>When considering the introduction of a new feature, it's essential to focus on user behavior and desires. The critical inquiry is not about the technical equivalence of proposed services to existing on-chain vaults but rather if there's a noticeable demand or usage pattern that justifies their implementation. This perspective shifts the discussion from a purely technical comparison to a user-centric approach, where the main concern is whether potential users currently utilize alternative solutions and if they would transition to an on-chain option should it become available. It's acknowledged that not all suggested alternatives have been thoroughly vetted, with some possibly being less viable or even impractical. This admission underscores the importance of discerning which features genuinely meet user needs versus those that might not contribute meaningful value.</summary>
