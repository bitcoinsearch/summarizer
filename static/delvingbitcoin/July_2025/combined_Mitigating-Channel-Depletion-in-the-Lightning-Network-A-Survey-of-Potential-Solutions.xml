    <summary>In the realm of Lightning Network (LN) scalability and efficiency, the conversation hinges on minimizing onchain actions while addressing payment failures and optimizing liquidity management. The distinction between infeasible payments, which inherently require onchain resolution, and feasible payments that fail due to issues like channel depletion, is critical. Solutions such as forwardable peerswaps and sidepools emerge as innovative strategies to mitigate these challenges. Forwardable peerswaps, for example, allow for the extension of liquidity rebalancing across multiple channels through a single onchain action, preserving transaction privacy within the network. Sidepools further contribute to this ecosystem by facilitating multiparty channels for rebalancing without compromising the privacy of routing information or necessitating additional onchain transactions.

The Forwardable Peerswaps proposal presents a method to optimize on-chain swaps by enabling the forwarding of these swaps from liquidity net senders to receivers, proposing a systemic improvement in liquidity distribution. This approach not only aims at enhancing channel rebalancing but also underscores a collaborative model for network participants to find mutually beneficial liquidity states. Such collaboration could significantly impact the overall network efficiency, as detailed in discussions and proposals linked within the discourse.

Moreover, the strategic use of `htlc_maximum_msat` emerges as a practical tool for managing liquidity and controlling payment flows within the LN. Various implementations, including Eclairâ€™s nuanced approach of adjusting `htlc_maximum_msat` based on dynamic estimates of channel capacity, illustrate the diverse strategies node operators can employ. These methods underscore a broader effort to fine-tune the balance between maintaining operational flexibility and managing the overhead of increased `channel_update` messages. The premise of reaching a consensus on the signaling intent behind `htlc_maximum_msat` values suggests an avenue for enhancing network-wide understanding and operational harmony.

Additionally, the proposal of a query-based system for path discovery represents a paradigm shift in addressing payment success rates within the network. By allowing nodes to request feasible outbound channel sets from their peers without disclosing specific channel balances, this approach promises to improve transaction success rates. It also offers nodes the discretion to adjust routing policies on-the-fly, potentially leading to more efficient liquidity management and optimized routing decisions.

At the core of LN's scalability and efficiency challenges lies the issue of channel depletion, attributed to selfish routing behaviors. Addressing this requires a multifaceted approach encompassing both protocol changes and adjustments in node behavior. Suggestions range from extending the gossip protocol to include liquidity information, exploring new routing algorithms, to voluntary practices like dynamic pricing and strategic liquidity relocation. Each proposed solution carries its own set of trade-offs concerning privacy, decentralization, and implementation complexity, highlighting the nuanced balancing act required to enhance the LN's performance.

This discourse not only maps out the current landscape of LN challenges and potential solutions but also invites ongoing dialogue for refinement and critique. As the community continues to navigate these complexities, the emphasis remains on enhancing network reliability and efficiency without sacrificing the foundational principles of privacy and decentralization inherent to Bitcoin and its Lightning Network.</summary>
