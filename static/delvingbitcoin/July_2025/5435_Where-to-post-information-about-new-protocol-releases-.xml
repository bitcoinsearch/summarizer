    <summary>In the evolving landscape of technology, the concept of client-side validation has garnered significant attention. This focus is not confined to a singular domain but spans across various technologies including OpenTimeStamps, RGB, and shielded client-side validation, as well as emerging tools like TapAss. The broad applicability and growing relevance of these technologies highlight the necessity for a dedicated "client-side-validation" tag. Such a tag would not only facilitate easier navigation and categorization within technological discussions but also underscore the expanding scope of client-side validation in modern tech developments. The proposal for this new tag reflects an acknowledgment of the diverse applications and the increasing importance of client-side validation techniques in ensuring data integrity and security across platforms.</summary>
