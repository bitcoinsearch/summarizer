    <summary>The discussion highlights concerns regarding the security vulnerabilities of P2TR (Pay to Taproot) transactions, specifically when subjected to long exposure attacks through the key path spend. The argument emphasizes that the option for individual users to migrate their coins to a more secure format does not inherently solve the problem, due to the lack of a universal expectation or requirement for all users to make such a migration. This issue is compounded by the fact that widespread consensus on disabling Elliptic Curve (EC) spending for P2TR, and other output types with known public keys, seems unlikely. Consequently, the risk remains that a substantial volume of Bitcoin may continue to be held in EC-protected outputs, posing a significant security threat. The writer suggests that the safety of user holdings cannot be assured until there is a comprehensive move to disable all EC spending, indicating a need for collective action or systemic changes to address the vulnerabilities associated with current cryptographic protections.</summary>
