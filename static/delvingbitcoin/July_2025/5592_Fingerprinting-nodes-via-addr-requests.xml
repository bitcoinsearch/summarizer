    <summary>The proposal to set the timestamp of each address from a GETADDR answer to a randomized but fixed value in the past, specifically around 10 ± 2 days ago, has been analyzed for potential downsides. This method of handling timestamps when addresses are saved into the recipient's AddrMan (Address Manager) is considered alongside other approaches, such as setting GETADDR responses to the current time or to a null value (0). The primary concern highlighted with this approach is the risk of creating a synchronized pattern across batches of addresses. If these addresses receive a timestamp that falls within a narrow timeframe, they could be collectively marked as 'Terrible' due to their simultaneous timestamping. This synchronization could lead to a scenario where these batches of addresses are at risk of being filtered out all at once, which poses a significant challenge in maintaining the diversity and robustness of the network's node address list.</summary>
