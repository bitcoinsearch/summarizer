    <summary>In engaging with online forums, user participation plays a crucial role in advancing through the site's trust levels. Initial involvement typically categorizes users as "new users," but active engagement such as reading posts, reacting to them, and contributing original posts or replies can elevate one's status. Achieving "member" status, which corresponds to level 2 within the forum hierarchy, comes with its perks. Notably, members gain the ability to create new tags, enhancing their capacity to contribute to and navigate the forum environment efficiently. This system encourages meaningful interaction and rewards users for their contributions to the community.</summary>
