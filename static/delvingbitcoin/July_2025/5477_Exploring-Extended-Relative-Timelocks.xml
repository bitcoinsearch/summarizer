    <summary>The discourse revolves around the consideration of extending a certain period from 10 years to potentially 20 years by increasing the units from 8 blocks to 16. The arbitrary selection of 8 blocks as a starting point is acknowledged, with an expressed indifference toward the specific value chosen. This suggests a flexibility and openness to adjustments based on practical considerations rather than a rigid adherence to the initially selected figure. The focus appears to be on future-proofing a process or system to avoid the need for revisiting or adjusting this aspect again shortly. The aim is to ensure longevity and stability in the planning, indicating a forward-thinking approach that values sustainability over temporary fixes.</summary>
