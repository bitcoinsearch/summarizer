    <summary>The correspondence begins by acknowledging the recipient's successful benchmarking efforts on Bitcoin Core, inquiring specifically about the version tested. It suggests an additional metric for consideration: the average overestimation factor, which quantifies the degree of overpayment in transaction fees. This factor is particularly relevant as minor overpayments might be acceptable to users prioritizing caution over cost efficiency. 

Furthermore, the writer shares their personal engagement with the project, highlighting hands-on experimentation with the library. To facilitate further discussion and collaboration, a tracking issue has been referenced, available at [https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur/issues/3](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur/issues/3). This link serves as a portal to more detailed observations and suggestions regarding the ongoing development work.</summary>
