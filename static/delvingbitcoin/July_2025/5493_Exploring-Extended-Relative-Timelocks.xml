    <summary>When discussing the intricacies of timelock mechanisms in cryptocurrency systems, a notable challenge arises with the creation of new descriptors every time a timelock is "rolled." This process essentially necessitates a fresh descriptor for each iteration, which can complicate the system unless there are changes to the existing descriptor specifications. One potential solution to address this complexity involves enhancing the descriptor specification to support semantics that can automatically adjust to future conditions, such as ensuring that any "next round year" is set at a minimum of five years ahead.

This approach would require wallets to dynamically generate all pertinent year marks since their initial creation date, or alternatively, limit the generation to the most recent twenty years. This proposal aims to streamline the management of timelocks by allowing for a more flexible and automated handling of time-based constraints within the cryptographic system. It's important to note that while this solution may offer a workaround to the current limitations posed by static descriptors, it also introduces considerations regarding its implementation and the overall impact on system efficiency and security.</summary>
