    <summary>In the discussion of utilizing covenants within constructions for enabling specific spending paths without the reliance on stable transaction identifiers (txids), Conditional Scriptless Scripts (CSFS) emerge as a notable solution. By opting for message signing rather than depending on txids, a new realm of possibilities opens up. This approach sidesteps the constraints associated with stable txids, offering a more flexible framework for executing transactions.

However, the case of *connector outputs* presents a unique challenge in this context. Unlike other components that might find easy substitutes or adaptations within covenant-based systems, *connector outputs* lack an obvious, straightforward alternative. This gap highlights a potential area for innovation and development within the field, suggesting that further exploration into covenant replacements or equivalents for these outputs could yield significant advancements.

The conversation also touches upon existing generalizations that do not rely on presigned transactions. Specifically, it mentions the concept of [ancestry proofs/singletons](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/contract-level-relative-timelocks-or-lets-talk-about-ancestry-proofs-and-singletons/1353), which represent a departure from traditional methods and offer a glimpse into the potential future directions of contract implementations. The discussion suggests that investigating opcodes that facilitate the cleanest implementation of such features could be particularly fruitful. Through exploring these avenues, the blockchain community can develop more versatile and efficient mechanisms for contract execution and transaction management, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what is currently achievable.</summary>
