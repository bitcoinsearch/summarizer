    <summary>The discussion revolves around enhancing the readability and user-friendliness of policy/miniscript to ensure that they can be validated on signing devices by average users efficiently. The point raised suggests a concern that adding more arguments to the policy semantics might complicate the understanding for non-technical users, potentially moving away from the goal of making these policies more accessible and straightforward. The emphasis is on simplifying the interface and the logic behind it so that it becomes more intuitive for users who may not have a deep understanding of the underlying technical complexities. This approach aims to bridge the gap between complex policy creation and end-user interaction, ensuring that security and functionality do not compromise usability.</summary>
