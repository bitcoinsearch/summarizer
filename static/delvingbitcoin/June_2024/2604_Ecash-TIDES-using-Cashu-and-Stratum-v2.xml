    <summary>The proposal in question is critiqued for being overly complex for its intended goal, which appears to be the facilitation of payouts using lightning or e-cash mechanisms. The critic suggests that for accomplishing just the payout objective, there's no necessity to link shares directly to e-cash or introduce any complex schemes. This implies a straightforward use of digital payment systems could suffice for distributing earnings without complicating the process by integrating shares and e-cash.

Furthermore, the discussion opens up to a broader perspective by considering the potential benefits of making pool shares a tradable asset through the use of e-cash. This proposition hints at an expanded goal beyond simple payout mechanisms, suggesting that if the aim includes creating a market for pool shares, employing e-cash might offer significant advantages. This could imply an innovative approach to enhancing liquidity and accessibility for investors in the pool, potentially transforming how shares are traded and owned.</summary>
