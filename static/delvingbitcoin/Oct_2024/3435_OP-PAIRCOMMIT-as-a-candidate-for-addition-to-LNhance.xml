    <summary>In a recent communication, a request was made to delete or archive an existing topic with the aim of initiating a new discussion in a PAIRCOMMIT thread. The reason behind this request stems from the desire to present less confusing information and to introduce the topic with an updated specification. It was mentioned that the code, initially in draft, has now been finalized but not in the variant previously discussed. This highlights an effort to streamline the discussion by starting afresh with the most current and relevant information.</summary>
