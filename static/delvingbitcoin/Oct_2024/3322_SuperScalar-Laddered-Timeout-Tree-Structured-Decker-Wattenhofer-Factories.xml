    <summary>In practice, many users successfully transition from off-chain to on-chain transactions, highlighting the practical feasibility of such operations. However, challenges persist in ensuring the reconciliation of off-chain states with the on-chain state of the blockchain before the expiration of safety timelocks. This issue is exacerbated in scenarios where there is a competitive environment for transaction fees aimed at confirming off-chain states. The ease of implementing solutions, albeit flawed, suggests a trend where products or functionalities might be rushed to users without thorough vetting for robustness and reliability. This approach raises concerns about the integrity of solutions provided to end-users, suggesting a need for more rigorous standards and testing before deployment.</summary>
