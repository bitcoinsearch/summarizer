    <summary>The email delves into the dynamics of consensus and progress within a particular technological space, expressing skepticism about the effectiveness of current models in describing reality. The sender challenges the notion that disagreements on key decisions, such as the activation of specific softforks, are primarily due to newer participants resisting change. Instead, it is argued that divergences in opinion do not correlate with the duration of one's involvement in the field. This perspective suggests that the root causes of stalled progress and consensus might lie elsewhere, beyond just the timeline of engagement by various stakeholders. The contention highlights a critical analysis of how consensus is reached and questions the prevailing assumptions about the barriers to progress.</summary>
