    <summary>The discussion revolves around the functionality of `FindAndDelete` in the context of Bitcoin scripting, specifically clarifying that it does not alter the script being executed but rather modifies a copy for the purpose of committing to it in the sighash. This process involves the removal of stack elements such as so and pubkey following the execution of `OP_CHECKSIG` or `OP_CHECKMULTISIG`, which consume these elements. The conversation further addresses a misunderstanding regarding the extent of data push removal by `FindAndDelete` and its btcd equivalent, `removeOpcodeByData`. Initially, there was confusion over the description that suggested `removeOpcodeByData` would eliminate any data push from the executed script. However, this removal is clarified to only halt on the currently executed `OP_CHECKSIG`, without impacting subsequent data pushes within the script.

Additionally, there's an acknowledgment of the complexity surrounding the functionality of btcd's `removeOpcodeByData` and its deviations from expected behavior. The individual has conducted extensive checking and re-testing of `OP_CODESEPARATOR` behaviors, especially when used to spend `SigVersion::Base` in 27.x peers, discovering some interesting behaviors. These findings are deemed significant enough to be shared privately, indicating nuanced insights into the operation and potential implications of `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in specific contexts.</summary>
