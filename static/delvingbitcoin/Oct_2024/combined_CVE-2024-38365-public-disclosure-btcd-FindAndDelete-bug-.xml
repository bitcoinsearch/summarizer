    <summary>The discovery of a significant flaw in versions of Btcd software prior to 0.24.2 by Niklas Gögge and Antoine Poinsot highlights a deviation from Bitcoin Core's legacy signature verification consensus rules. This vulnerability stems from the script interpreter's method of reconstructing the signed message for transaction input verification, where Btcd's `removeOpcodeByData` diverges from the expected `FindAndDelete` process. Instead of removing only exact matches of the signature being verified, Btcd's implementation removed any data push containing the signature. This discrepancy could allow an attacker to forge a Script that Bitcoin Core would accept but would lead to the rejection by affected Btcd nodes, facilitating a potential chain fork with minimal effort.

This issue was identified due to a 2014 commit aimed at aligning with a new Bitcoin Core unit test, which inadvertently introduced the flaw. Upon discovering this critical vulnerability, Gögge and Poinsot reported their findings to Olaoluwa Osuntokun, initiating a series of discussions that led to the resolution of the problem. Their efforts were recognized with a bug bounty awarded by the Btcd maintainers. The resolution process involved the assignment of CVE identifiers, [CVE-2024-36051](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36051) and [CVE-2024-38365](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/security/advisories/GHSA-27vh-h6mc-q6g8), followed by the implementation of a covert fix through PR [2178](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/pull/2178). This led to the release of Btcd version 0.24.2, which addressed the vulnerability. The responsible disclosure of this issue on September 20, 2024, ensured that the community was informed and safeguarded against potential exploits.

The underlying technology that facilitated the identification of this flaw involves public key recovery, a technique used in cryptographic systems to derive a public key from a digital signature without accessing the original public key. This method is vital in creating scripts that verify signatures while handling additional data, such as the signature itself and extra padding information, to meet specific script requirements or enhance security. Public key recovery is beneficial in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies for its efficiency in data storage and transmission, as well as its role in enhancing security protocols by validating transactions without directly revealing the public key. This technique supports the development of more secure and efficient cryptographic processes, contributing significantly to advancements in blockchain technology and cybersecurity.</summary>
