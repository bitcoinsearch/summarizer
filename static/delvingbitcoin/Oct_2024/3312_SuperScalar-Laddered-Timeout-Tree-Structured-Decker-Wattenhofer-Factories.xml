    <summary>The email discusses the intriguing phenomenon within the cryptocurrency and blockchain domain, particularly focusing on the practical aspects of swapping between offchain and onchain transactions, as well as making payments over the Lightning network. Despite theoretical concerns and high onchain transaction fees, users continue to successfully engage in these activities across multiple hops. This situation underlines a peculiar discrepancy where, in practice, the systems and methods employed are functioning effectively, even though theoretical models may suggest otherwise. This real-world effectiveness hints at the complex, yet functional nature of blockchain technologies and their applications, demonstrating their resilience and utility in facilitating digital transactions despite potential theoretical limitations. The observation emphasizes the importance of practical outcomes over theoretical predictions in the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency transactions.</summary>
