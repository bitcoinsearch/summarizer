    <summary>The discussion revolves around the specific behavior of Bitcoin scripts, particularly focusing on how signatures commit to the `scriptCode` under certain conditions. A key point highlighted is the role of the `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in this process. It's noted that without using `OP_CODESEPARATOR`, signatures are expected to commit to the `scriptCode`. However, there's an acknowledgment of scenarios where the signature might not be valid with respect to the `scriptCode`, yet the script execution could still proceed successfully.

One example given involves the use of `OP_EQUALVERIFY`. The explanation suggests that under certain policy conditions (specifically mentioning the `NULLFAIL` policy), a core implementation should only remove one instance of failure upon encountering a `CHECKSIG` operation that does not pass. This would allow the script to continue and potentially succeed upon reaching operations like `OP_SIZE`. Conversely, it's mentioned that non-upgraded versions of btcd (a Bitcoin full node implementation) might behave differently by removing two instances when faced with an invalid signature plus noise scenario. This difference in handling could lead to failures in subsequent operations such as `OP_SIZE` and `OP_EQUALVERIFY`, illustrating a divergence in behavior between core and non-upgraded btcd implementations regarding script execution and signature validation.</summary>
