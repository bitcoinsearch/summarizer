    <title>Expanding on BOLT12</title>

    <summary>The discussion reveals an observation regarding the BOLT12 specification, which lacks a defined prefix for invoices. To address this gap, the proposal is to adopt the `lni` prefix, which, despite not being officially specified, is already in use by Core Lightning (CLN) for certain Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). This adoption is evident in CLN's implementation of the `fetchinvoice` and `pay` commands, as detailed in their documentation. The links to the respective RPC commands on CLN's documentation shed light on how `lni` is utilized within these contexts: [lightning-fetchinvoice](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference/lightning-fetchinvoice) illustrates the command's use in fetching invoices, while [lightning-pay](https://docs.corelightning.org/reference/lightning-pay) demonstrates its application in payment processes. This insight suggests an unofficial but practical standard emerging within the community, underscoring the necessity for a more formalized approach to invoice prefixes in the BOLT12 specification.</summary>
