    <summary>In the discussion, a programmer has developed a documented Bitcoin Core unit test as a patch. This patch is capable of generating a specific transaction, which was sent to Laolu as part of an original report. The programmer expresses hesitation about sharing this information publicly due to concerns that it might facilitate malicious activities by individuals with minimal technical skills, colloquially referred to as "script kiddies." To mitigate this risk, the plan involves initially sharing the patch privately before considering a broader disclosure on the thread at a later time.</summary>
