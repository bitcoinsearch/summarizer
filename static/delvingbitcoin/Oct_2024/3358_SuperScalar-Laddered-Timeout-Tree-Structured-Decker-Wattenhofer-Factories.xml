    <summary>Block has made it clear that there is no intention to patent SuperScalar or limit its usage in any way. The primary aim of publishing SuperScalar on delving and presenting it at the summit was to share it with the public openly. This approach indicates a commitment to transparency and community engagement in the development process. Furthermore, the content shared consists mainly of initial design notes, emphasizing an early stage in SuperScalar's development. The decision to design SuperScalar publicly on delving underscores a desire for open innovation and collaboration.

Additionally, the stance on avoiding non-technical engagements and the mention of technical expertise not bringing anything new to the table suggests a focus on advancing the project based on unique contributions. This approach aims to streamline discussions around SuperScalar, focusing solely on substantive technical advancements rather than revisiting previously addressed concerns or engaging in non-technical dialogues.</summary>
