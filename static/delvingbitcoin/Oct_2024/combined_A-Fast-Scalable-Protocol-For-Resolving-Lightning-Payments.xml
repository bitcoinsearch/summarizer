    <summary>The revised paper, now available at [https://github.com/JohnLaw2/ln-opr](https://github.com/JohnLaw2/ln-opr), introduces significant updates to the Offchain Payment Routing (OPR) protocol, focusing on speed and scalability enhancements while maintaining security analogues to the current Lightning protocol for small payments. By adhering to the protocol, parties aim to preserve their long-term reputation, which in turn prevents theft, illustrating a trust-based mechanism akin to traditional financial systems. The update further delves into the intricacies of Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs), spotlighting the vulnerability introduced by reliance on external timestamps for dispute resolution. The narrative underscores that internal verification supersedes external data, marking a pivotal shift towards self-reliance in contract disputes and emphasizing the protocol’s built-in mechanisms against fraudulent claims based on timestamp manipulation.

The discussion extends to the OPR protocol's novel approach to channel disputes, particularly its stance on force-closing channels. Unlike the current Lightning Network protocol, the OPR discourages financially beneficial force closures through a balanced penalty system, thereby addressing potential griefing attacks without necessitating a minimum burn contribution. This strategic pivot aims to mitigate unresolved HTLCs' impact by allowing channels to operate at reduced capacity rather than forcing immediate closure, thus preserving off-chain transaction integrity. The acknowledgment of timing attacks and network reliability issues within this framework points towards a comprehensive attempt to fortify transaction security and consensus, even amidst inherent communication challenges.

Further exploration reveals a nuanced perspective on the economic and operational dynamics within the OPR system. For instance, the handling of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks unveils a critical vulnerability where nodes could incur financial losses due to disrupted communication, highlighting the necessity for robust defenses against IP-layer attacks. This aspect is juxtaposed with the protocol's deterrent measures against theft and exploitation, asserting that mutual deterrence based on reputational and financial stakes underpins the system's integrity. Yet, the discourse acknowledges the trade-offs involved, especially in light of blockchain congestion and the prioritization of scalable, off-chain payment resolutions.

An additional layer of complexity is unveiled through the protocol’s adjustments concerning disputed HTLCs, transitioning towards a more flexible dispute resolution mechanism that mitigates punitive damages against honest participants. This evolution reflects a deeper understanding of practical challenges within digital contract enforcement and the pursuit of equilibrium between security and efficiency. Moreover, the analysis touches upon the broader implications of these protocol adjustments for network performance, including the potential for increased routing costs due to operational failures and the strategic deployment of probabilistic payments as a countermeasure.

In essence, the paper outlines a comprehensive overhaul of the OPR protocol, targeting enhanced scalability, security, and efficiency within the Lightning Network. By addressing key vulnerabilities, introducing deterrents against malicious behavior, and refining the economic model governing transactions, the protocol endeavors to provide a more resilient framework for cryptocurrency transactions. This effort not only reflects a significant technical advancement but also signals a shift towards more adaptable and user-centric payment infrastructures in the digital currency landscape.</summary>
