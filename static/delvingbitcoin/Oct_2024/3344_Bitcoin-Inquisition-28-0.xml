    <summary>The latest release, Bitcoin Inquisition 28.0, is now publicly accessible at the provided [GitHub link](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/releases/tag/v28.0-inq), building upon the foundations of [Bitcoin Core 28.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/28.0/). This version introduces several significant enhancements including support for TRUC and anchor relay mechanisms while implementing a default full replace by fee behavior to optimize transaction handling. Furthermore, it integrates proposed consensus changes aimed at improving the protocol's flexibility and security. Among these are the implementation of BIP 119, known as OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY ([PR66](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/66)), BIP 118's SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT ([PR67](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/67)), and BIN-2024-1 or BIP 347's OP_CAT ([PR68](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/68)), which have been active on the default signet since specific blocks in 2022 and 2024 respectively.

It's important to note that transactions utilizing these new features will only be relayed by nodes that support them, necessitating users who wish their transactions to be mined to connect with other inquisition nodes. An effective method to ensure connectivity is through the specification of `addnode=inquisition.bitcoin-signet.net`. By default, Bitcoin Inquisition nodes make themselves known via a subversion string, visible through the `bitcoin-cli -netinfo 3` command. For more comprehensive details about this upgrade and its implications, reference is made to the [23.0 announcement](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021275.html). This release marks a step forward in the continuous evolution of Bitcoin, offering advanced functionalities and proposing further consensus changes to enhance user experience and network integrity.</summary>
