    <summary>The OP_PAIRCOMMIT specification is currently in development, with plans to propose changes through a pull request against BINANA upon completion. The detailed specification and progress can be viewed on GitHub, where it has been thoroughly outlined and shared for public access. The specific details, including technical descriptions and implementation strategies, are available at [this link](https://gist.github.com/moonsettler/d7f1fb88e3e54ee7ecb6d69ff126433b). This initiative reflects an ongoing effort to enhance the functionality of BINANA by integrating the OP_PAIRCOMMIT feature, which is expected to offer significant improvements and optimizations.</summary>
