    <summary>The modification of the utreexo hash function to employ SHA-256, which is complemented by a Risc0 precompile, has significantly improved efficiency by reducing the proving time to 22 seconds. This enhancement is visually documented and can be seen in the provided screenshot. Following this alteration, it has been observed that the computational intensity within the process is now predominantly governed by two elliptic curve (EC) multiplications. These operations are critical for blinding the key and generating the taproot output key, alongside the serialization and deserialization (serde) processes within the Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (ZKVM). This shift emphasizes the ongoing challenges and areas for optimization in cryptographic processes, particularly in terms of computational demands associated with EC operations and data handling in ZKVM environments.</summary>
