    <summary>In addressing the issue of handling negative weights within a network flow problem, a simple yet potentially effective solution is proposed. By setting all negative weights to zero, the complication of including positive weights in a minimum cut is effectively eliminated. This approach simplifies the process since there are no longer any negative weights that would necessitate the inclusion of positive ones to balance them out. This strategy could streamline the optimization of network flows by removing the need to account for negative weights, thus making the calculation of minimum cuts more straightforward.</summary>
