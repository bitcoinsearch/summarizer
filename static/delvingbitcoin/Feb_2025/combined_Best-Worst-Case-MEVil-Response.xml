    <summary>In recent discussions, the concept of MEVil has been highlighted as a significant concern within the Bitcoin ecosystem. MEVil refers to the financial incentive for miners to employ advanced technology to ensure that the transactions they include in the next block maximize value. This approach requires a high level of financial sophistication, akin to what is found at high-frequency trading firms, a deep understanding of smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, and access to substantial liquidity. Despite potential latency issues similar to those experienced with Intel SGX, modern Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like TDX offer near-native performance, making latency negligible. Research, such as the study available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.00443v1), supports this perspective, though it also indicates that certain proposals may be suboptimal due to these challenges.

The process of transaction sequencing, particularly when involving smart contracts, necessitates complex modifications. For instance, accepting a bid while including a transaction that interacts with a specific smart contract often requires changing the transaction to spend an output of another, along with updating the witness data to account for value discrepancies. This complexity has led to the proposal of a "mevpool marketplace," where bids can be made for packages of transactions. This model would allow proposers to submit multiple transactions in a single bid, simplifying the process for both miners and proposers by focusing on packages rather than individual transactions. The marketplace would also facilitate sealed bids, with details like UTXOs spent, transaction IDs, and fees disclosed, relying either on marketplace integrity or a TEE to secure transaction contents.

Critics of current MEV strategies argue that they do not adequately address structural issues or the need for sophisticated technology. There's skepticism about whether the proposed solutions, such as the mevpool marketplace, can effectively ensure real-time delivery of block templates from market operators or validate the integrity of block templates against marginal downgrades in fee rates. Concerns are also raised about the practicality of seal-based solutions and the reliance on TEEs for block templating due to potential latency issues inherent in such approaches.

A proposed solution to the proliferation of MEVil involves adopting a model similar to Ethereum's proposer-builder separation (PBS), but with a focus on bidding for the inclusion of individual or grouped transactions with specific constraints. This approach aims to maintain the public mempool's reliability for transaction inclusion while allowing for specialized MEV extraction bids. It suggests two methods for private transaction inclusion: trusting marketplaces or using TEEs to encrypt transactions until a valid block is found. While recognizing the potential centralization risks, this proposal seeks to mitigate MEV-related issues like frontrunning while contemplating a future where MEVil plays a significant role in mining.</summary>
