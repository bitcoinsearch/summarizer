    <summary>The discussion on the preflow-push algorithm, particularly in the context of the Goldberg and Tarjan's (GGT) approach, reveals that this algorithm can be effectively applied to parametric problems, such as the maximum-rate-closure problem. This application maintains the original runtime complexity of \(O(n^3)\) when implemented with a FIFO strategy. An important observation is the focus on identifying the min-cut set rather than determining the maxflow value itself. This focus offers a strategic advantage by potentially reducing the algorithm's running time by half, as the process may be terminated earlier once the min-cut set is identified, without fully computing the maxflow. This efficiency in algorithm execution not only underscores the versatility of the preflow-push algorithm in handling specific network flow problems but also highlights an opportunity for optimization in computational operations.</summary>
