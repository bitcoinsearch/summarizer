    <summary>The discussion revolves around the evaluation of priorities in the development process, specifically concerning the FIBRE patch set and its potential update. It was concluded, after an offline discussion with several individuals, that dedicating time and resources to update and maintain the FIBRE patch set, alongside reinstating public servers, would be more advantageous than exploring alternative improvements. This decision was influenced by the recognition of numerous factors leading to misses or setbacks in development, suggesting that efforts should focus on straightforward, impactful enhancements. Moreover, the idea of revisiting a peer-to-peer version of FIBRE was proposed for consideration, indicating an interest in exploring innovative approaches to optimization and efficiency within the project's scope.</summary>
