    <summary>The discussion revolves around the challenges and considerations in implementing a decentralized model for network communications, specifically addressing the technical nuances of transmission protocols. A key point highlighted is the design choice of using FIBRE, which is tailored for UDP (User Datagram Protocol) to minimize latency issues that are often encountered with TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) due to its retransmission mechanism. This choice underlines the importance of selecting appropriate protocols to optimize performance in network communications, particularly in scenarios where speed and efficiency are paramount. The potential shift from UDP to TCP within a peer-to-peer network framework is viewed with caution, as it could significantly degrade the system's responsiveness and efficiency due to TCP's inherent characteristics. This insight into protocol selection underscores the complexities involved in designing decentralized networks and the critical role of underlying technologies in achieving desired outcomes.</summary>
