    <summary>The innovative aspect of the Graphene Gossip Technique (GGT) lies in its approach to solving the "maximum feerate closure" without the need for bisection. This method maintains the computational complexity equivalent to that of a single "max. weight closure." The mention of GGT was initially intended as a shorthand for referencing "min-cut based approaches." However, it's important to clarify that the novelty attributed to GGT does not originate from these min-cut based methodologies, as they were introduced prior to the development of GGT. This distinction highlights the unique contribution of GGT to the field, focusing on efficiency and simplification of computational processes related to transaction fee rates within a given network.</summary>
