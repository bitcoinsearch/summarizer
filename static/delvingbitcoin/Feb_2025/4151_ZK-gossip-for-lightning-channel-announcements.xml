    <summary>The discussion revolves around exploring various cryptographic schemes such as STARKs, SNARKs, Curve Trees, and ring signatures to achieve specific goals including verification time, proof size, and crypto maturity. The focus is on finding a practical solution for the scheme in question, with an emphasis on @halseth's approach using zkSTARKs. This exploration underlines the importance of considering different alternatives to address the challenges presented by the scheme, highlighting a collaborative spirit among participants to share insights and discuss potential pathways forward.</summary>
