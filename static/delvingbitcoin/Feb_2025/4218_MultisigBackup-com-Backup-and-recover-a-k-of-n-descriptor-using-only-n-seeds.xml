    <summary>The utilization of globally replicated databases for storing information of interest to only a single individual is not seen as an efficient or sustainable practice. Such databases might present themselves as convenient solutions during periods of low demand for block space. However, relying on this method could lead to unrealistic expectations regarding its long-term viability. It's important to recognize that backups are necessary for various types of data, suggesting that incorporating a small amount of specific data into these backups should be straightforward and can be done in a manner that maintains plausible deniability. This approach highlights the need for more traditional methods of data storage and backup, underscoring the importance of planning for the longevity and security of one’s data beyond the allure of modern technological conveniences.</summary>
