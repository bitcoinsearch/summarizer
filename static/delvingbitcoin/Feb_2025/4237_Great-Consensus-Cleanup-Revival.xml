    <summary>The prohibition of 64-byte transactions within the network is identified as problematic, especially in scenarios where there may be a shift from the current 256-bit hash digest utilized for the merkle tree structure. The core issue with 64-byte transactions stems from a fundamental design flaw in Bitcoin's transaction ID (txid) Merkle tree. This flaw lies in the inability of the system to differentiate between internal nodes and leaves. Consequently, any future considerations for altering the Merkle tree design, including changes to the hash function, necessitate an initial approach that focuses on rectifying this inherent design flaw to ensure a more robust architecture.</summary>
