    <summary>In the realm of Bitcoin Core, the management of orphan transactions is a critical aspect to ensure the network operates smoothly. The function `LimitOrphans()` plays a pivotal role in this process. It is invoked each time an orphan transaction is added to the node's orphanage. The primary purpose of this function is to maintain the orphanage size within predefined limits to prevent it from becoming too large, which could potentially hamper the node's performance.

The default maximum size for the orphanage is set at 100 transactions. This parameter can be adjusted by users through the `-maxorphantx=n` command-line option, allowing for flexibility based on the node operator's preferences or hardware capabilities. When the number of orphaned transactions exceeds this limit, `LimitOrphans()` automatically removes one random orphan transaction from the collection. This action is necessary to make room for new orphans and is systematically logged as `orphanage overflow, removed 1 tx`, providing transparency and traceability for node operators who wish to monitor such events.

An analysis of debug logs from various nodes, all configured with the default orphanage size, reveals how this mechanism functions in real-world scenarios. Such insights are invaluable for understanding the dynamics of orphan transaction management within Bitcoin Core nodes and the effectiveness of current strategies to mitigate potential overflows. The process underscores the delicate balance between maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring the network's resilience against spam or other malicious activities designed to overload nodes with orphan transactions.

For further technical details regarding the implementation and functionality of `LimitOrphans()`, interested readers can refer to Bitcoin Core's official GitHub repository, specifically the files related to transaction orphanage management ([`txorphanage.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/33932d30e382d1296be438ec5365fa0a56cf0864/src/txorphanage.cppL123) and [`txdownloadman_impl.cpp`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/33932d30e382d1296be438ec5365fa0a56cf0864/src/node/txdownloadman_impl.cppL431)).</summary>
