    <summary>The discussion revolves around the integration of FIBRE code, which is AGPL licensed as seen in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitcoinfibre/bitcoinfibre/blob/65e12faf7c5516757476b9b9f227b9bd497ab8cb/src/fec.cpp), into the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. The licensing of FIBRE suggests that for it to be incorporated within Bitcoin's framework, either a complete rewrite or a relicense of the code would be necessary due to the compatibility issues between AGPL and Bitcoin's licensing requirements.

The potential application of FIBRE in a decentralized setting raises several questions. One possible implementation could involve allowing users to select specific peers for ultra-high-bandwidth compact block relay. These selected peers would then stream an FEC-encoded version of the block contents immediately following the compact block announcement. However, the feasibility of opening this feature to random peers versus restricting it to a list of whitelisted peers is unclear. This distinction could significantly impact how effectively the system operates within the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, suggesting a need for careful consideration of access and security measures in any proposed integration strategy.</summary>
