    <summary>Antoine Poinsot's article, "[Stating the obvious](https://antoinep.com/posts/stating_the_obvious/)," presents a compelling argument regarding the dominance of Bitcoin Core as the primary full node implementation suitable for all Bitcoin users. Poinsot articulates that due to both technical and historical reasons, alternatives to Bitcoin Core face substantial hurdles. These challenges are not just trivial obstacles but significant technical difficulties that could lead to consensus bugs within re-implementations of Bitcoin. This perspective underscores the inherent complexities and potential risks associated with deviating from the Bitcoin Core implementation.

The discussion also raises questions about the feasibility of integrating other clients into the Bitcoin ecosystem. The inquiry into whether Bitcoin Core could accommodate alternative clients without undergoing a hard fork highlights the complexities involved in modifying the core protocol. Such a change, if possible, would represent a major shift in the Bitcoin network's operation, suggesting that any attempt to diversify the client base would need to overcome considerable technical barriers. This conversation points towards an understanding of the intricate balance between innovation and stability within the Bitcoin network, emphasizing the cautious approach required when contemplating fundamental changes to its infrastructure.</summary>
