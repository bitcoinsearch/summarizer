    <summary>The LIMO (Linearization through Incremental Merging of Optimizations) algorithm presents a novel approach to optimizing the linearization of clusters, specifically addressing the inefficiencies found in previous methods. It introduces a strategy that combines the strengths of ancestor-set based linearization and computationally-bounded search to generate an improved sequence of transactions. The core idea revolves around starting with an initial linearization, likely derived from ancestor sets, and iteratively refining it by incorporating topologically valid subsets identified through bounded search. This process ensures that each step of optimization does not degrade the overall quality of the linearization, by maintaining or improving the feerate of the transaction sequence.

One of the key innovations of LIMO is its use of a merge operation that integrates the findings of the bounded search into the existing linearization without diminishing its effectiveness. This method contrasts sharply with previous strategies that either utilized merging too late in the process or required redundant searches for optimal ancestor sets. By embedding the search results early and directly into the linearization process, LIMO enhances the efficiency and outcome of the linearization.

Additionally, LIMO introduces the concept of single-set improvement steps, which significantly reduce the computational complexity associated with the merge operations. This refinement allows for a more practical application of the algorithm by limiting the potential slowdowns that could arise from multiple complex merge operations. The approach ensures that as long as the quality of selected subsets does not decline, the resultant linearization will be at least as good as the sum of its parts.

Moreover, the algorithm is adaptable, capable of improving upon existing linearizations as well as creating new ones from scratch. This flexibility is further extended through the development of Double LIMO, a variation that allows for the incorporation of two distinct high-feerate subsets in each iteration, thereby potentially enhancing the optimization process even further. Such advancements suggest that LIMO can be effectively applied in various scenarios, including updating clusters with new transactions, while retaining or improving the linearization quality.

The potential of LIMO is evident in its ability to harmonize different linearization strategies, offering improvements over traditional methods. It paves the way for more efficient transaction handling within clusters by ensuring that each step of the process contributes positively to the final result. The algorithm’s design reflects a thoughtful consideration of the challenges inherent in cluster linearization, proposing solutions that are both innovative and practical. Further exploration and application of LIMO and its variations could lead to significant advancements in the field.</summary>
