    <summary>The discussion revolves around a strategy to prevent the drainage of miner resources by implementing a zero-fee enforcement mechanism within a transactional context. This approach necessitates that the non-covenant input mirrors the amount specified in output_1, essentially classifying it as a dust amount. Consequently, the transaction costs associated with this operation would need to be covered through a Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) scheme, utilizing the dust-paying output to settle the required fees. 

Furthermore, the narrative touches upon potential complexities that might arise during the 'complete withdrawal' phase of the process. However, a detailed analysis of these complications has not been conducted, leaving room for further exploration and understanding of the challenges that could emerge in later stages of transaction finalization.</summary>
