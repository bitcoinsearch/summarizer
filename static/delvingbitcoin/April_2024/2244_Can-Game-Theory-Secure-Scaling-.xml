    <summary>The growing preference for custodial lightning wallets within the cryptocurrency community has sparked both interest and concern. While it is acknowledged that using custodians is currently more cost-effective, there's a strong belief that this approach is not essential for the ecosystem's growth. The primary goal is to increase the number of sovereign users. This ambition aims to democratize access to the technology without compromising the integrity of the time-chain. Balancing the desire to make the system accessible to a broader audience while maintaining its foundational principles presents a complex challenge. There's an underlying tension between the ease of use facilitated by custodial services and the ideal of user sovereignty and network health.</summary>
