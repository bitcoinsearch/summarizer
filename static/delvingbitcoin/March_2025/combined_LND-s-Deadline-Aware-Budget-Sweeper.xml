    <summary>The Lightning Network Daemon (LND) version 0.18.0 marks a significant advancement in the management of on-chain transactions within the Lightning Network through the introduction of a reimagined sweeper subsystem. This new system innovates by integrating HTLC deadlines and budget considerations into transaction batching and fee bumping processes. It utilizes a dynamic fee adjustment mechanism based on a fee rate curve, which prioritizes transactions by their urgency. This method is designed to enhance security and mitigate the risks associated with lost or stolen HTLCs due to missed deadlines or insufficient fee payments.

Unlike previous strategies that depended on external fee estimators or an exponential fee-bumping approach, LND's revised strategy employs a calculated fee function tailored to each HTLC's specific deadline and budget. This allows for a more accurate and efficient management of transaction fees. The system aggregates HTLC claims into single batched transactions, optimizing fee expenditure in line with predefined parameters and adjusting fees with each new block until the deadline is met. This not only addresses vulnerabilities and bugs found in earlier versions but also significantly improves the network's defenses against replacement cycling and partial pinning attacks by offering better protection for larger HTLC values through proportional fee budgets.

One of the key benefits of this updated methodology is its reduced reliance on fee rate estimators and a more structured Replace-By-Fee (RBF) strategy, enhancing the consistency of outcomes under fluctuating mempool conditions. However, transitioning to this new on-chain logic is not without risks, as it could introduce new bugs and vulnerabilities. Despite these concerns, the development team has carefully reviewed and addressed major issues, emphasizing the importance of simplicity in securing the network.

In essence, LND's overhauled sweeper subsystem represents a forward leap in securing and streamlining on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network. By advocating for other Lightning implementations to adopt similar budget-aware mechanisms in their fee bumping strategies, the update aims to bolster network defenses and increase overall reliability, presenting a more secure and efficient framework for handling transactions.</summary>
