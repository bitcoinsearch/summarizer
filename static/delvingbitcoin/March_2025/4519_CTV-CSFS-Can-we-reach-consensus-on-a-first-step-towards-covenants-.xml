The central issue raised indicates a perception that decisions are being made or discussions concluded without a thorough analysis or presentation of the potential advantages to Liquid. This implies a need for further evaluation and possibly more detailed exploration into how the subject matter could positively impact Liquid, suggesting that a more data-driven or evidence-based approach might be necessary before finalizing any decisions or closing off discussions on the topic at hand.</summary>
