    <summary>The discussion highlights the importance of differentiating between direct and indirect users of Bitcoin Core software, emphasizing that the security and accessibility of the network are crucial for all users. The argument is made that while all Bitcoin users are affected by the quality of the Bitcoin software, not all interact with it directly. However, this does not diminish their stake in the software's performance and reliability. It suggests a prioritization based on the stake each component holds, noting that the Core node's significance to the network's integrity far outweighs that of the Core wallet or GUI for individual transactions or value storage. The point is made that despite the lesser priority of the wallet and GUI compared to the node, they still hold importance for non-technical users.

Further discussion critiques the current state of the Core GUI, which has seen minimal development and is noted for being inconvenient and less preferred than other interfaces like Sparrow. The lack of usability on newer Macs and discontinued automated unit testing on Windows highlight significant neglect, suggesting that the GUI fails to serve as a user-friendly entry point for non-technical users to engage with Bitcoin. The argument extends to resource allocation within the Core project, advocating for a focus on the Core node due to its critical importance and the limited resources available.

The debate also touches on the broader implications of defining who constitutes a 'user' of the software, challenging the notion that only direct interactions qualify someone as a user. By comparing the role of software in service provision (such as ISPs) to the Bitcoin network, the discussion illustrates the impact of software beyond direct interaction. This comparison is critiqued, however, by pointing out the unique nature of Bitcoin as a public consensus system and the distinct consequences of buggy software within this context.

Finally, the conversation raises concerns about the potential for demagoguery to exploit these nuanced understandings, leading to a portion of the network running inferior software. This underlines the importance of thoughtful consideration of software development priorities and the balance between direct user interface improvements and the overall health and security of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
