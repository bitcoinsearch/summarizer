    <summary>Tweaking keys is a versatile technique applicable across various address types that employ OP_CHECKSIG, including the potential for modifications to DER signatures for P2PK addresses. This method's primary advantage lies in its ability to allow for the generation of new signatures following the compromise of a private key, while simultaneously preventing alterations to prior commitments within the blockchain. The challenge, however, does not stem from the technical execution of this approach but rather from the necessity of establishing a standardized process. Such standardization is crucial for ensuring that, when updates to the rules are desired by the community, the new code can accurately accommodate all existing commitments. This is particularly important given the likelihood of multiple commitment schemes being adopted by different users, which underscores the need for a comprehensive and universally applicable standardization strategy.</summary>
