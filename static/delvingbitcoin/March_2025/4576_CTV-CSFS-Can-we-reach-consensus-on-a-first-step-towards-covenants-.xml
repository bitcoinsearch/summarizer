    <summary>In discussions around programming, particularly in the realm of opcode development and implementation, a critical point of consideration is the composability with future opcodes. Without factoring this into design decisions, the utility of a "push to stack" variant is significantly limited, primarily restricted to performing equality checks. This underscores the importance of forward-thinking in opcode design to ensure broad utility and compatibility with potential future developments in the programming landscape.</summary>
