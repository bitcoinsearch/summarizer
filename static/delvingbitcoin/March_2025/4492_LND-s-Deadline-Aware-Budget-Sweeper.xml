    <title>LND's Deadline-Aware Budget Sweeper</title>

    <summary>The introduction of a new sweeper in LND that sets fee budgets in proportion to HTLC values marks a significant advancement in the defense against replacement cycling attacks and HTLC expiry bribe attacks. This methodology ensures that conducting such attacks becomes uneconomical, leveraging the common-sense approach to enhance security within the network. The concept of "miner harvesting" is acknowledged alongside the potential for bribing miners through a timeout transaction. The implication here is that attackers must provide substantial incentives to miners to execute such strategies successfully. This development underscores the ongoing efforts to fortify network defenses and safeguard against vulnerabilities by making certain attack vectors financially impractical for would-be attackers.</summary>
