    <summary>Ensuring the recipient is online at the time of sending a message introduces an interesting tradeoff between user experience (UX) and trust. A solution that has been explored involves relying on the server and sender not to collude, which, while introducing a time-limited security assumption, mitigates the need for interactivity. This approach highlights the significant impact of UX considerations on designing secure communication systems, where ease of use is sometimes balanced against potential security risks. This decision points towards a broader discussion in the field of technology and securityâ€”how best to balance user convenience with the necessity of maintaining robust security measures. It underscores the importance of understanding and navigating the tradeoffs between interactivity and trust within the realm of secure communications.</summary>
