    <summary>In the recent discussion, there was an emphasis on the importance of allowing code to mature before its implementation, especially in scenarios where it's expected to perform under pressure, such as debates. This perspective suggests a cautious approach towards adopting newly developed technologies or software updates instantly after their creation. The argument underlines the value of giving new code some time to be thoroughly tested and vetted to ensure its reliability and effectiveness in critical applications. 

The notion that Steven has dedicated the last hour to working on this project indicates a rapid development cycle, yet it highlights a common pitfall in software development: the rush to deploy. While quick iterations are crucial for progress and responding to immediate needs, they must be balanced with the necessity for quality assurance. This balance ensures that any deployment, particularly in high-stakes environments like debates, is supported by confidence in the technologyâ€™s performance and stability.</summary>
