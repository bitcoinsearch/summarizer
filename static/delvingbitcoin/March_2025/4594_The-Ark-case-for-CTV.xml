    <summary>In the realm of cryptocurrency transactions, specifically within a particular model being discussed, there exists an option for users to mitigate certain trust limitations by refreshing their Unspent Transaction Output (VTXO) during a transaction round. This action effectively resets the trust level associated with the VTXO, as any output resulting directly from a round is deemed to carry a standard trust assumption, unlike those that have not been refreshed. The mechanism behind this involves users executing a "send to self" transaction, which allows them to bypass the complexities and potential security concerns associated with sending assets to others. This approach simplifies the process on the client's end, requiring the system to only handle these self-directed transactions accurately to maintain integrity and trust within the system. This strategy presents a unique method of enhancing security and trust in the transaction process by leveraging the inherent features of the blockchain technology involved.</summary>
