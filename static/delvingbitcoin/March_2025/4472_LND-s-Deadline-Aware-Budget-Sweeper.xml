    <summary>The Lightning Network Daemon (LND) version 0.18.0 introduces a revised sweeper subsystem that innovates on the process of transaction batching and fee bumping by incorporating HTLC deadlines and budget considerations into its operations. This new approach allows for dynamic adjustment of fees through a fee rate curve, prioritizing transactions based on urgency while aiming to enhance security and reduce the risk of lost or stolen HTLCs due to missed deadlines or inadequate fee payments.

Previously, Lightning nodes relied on either external fee rate estimators or an exponential fee bumping strategy to ensure timely confirmation of transactions. However, these methods could fall short in situations of mempool congestion or unexpected miner behavior, potentially leading to missed deadlines. LND's new strategy addresses these issues by calculating a fee function based on the deadline and budget specific to each HTLC, allowing for more precise and efficient handling of transaction fees.

The design of this system is centered around the concept that each HTLC has an associated deadline by which it must be confirmed and a maximum budget that the node operator is willing to spend on fees. By aggregating HTLC claims into a single batched transaction, LND can optimize fee spending according to these parameters, adjusting the fee with each block until the deadline is reached. This methodology not only improves upon the security measures against certain types of attacks but also rectifies vulnerabilities and bugs present in previous versions of LND's sweeper system.

One significant advantage of LND's updated sweeper is its enhanced defense against replacement cycling and partial pinning attacks, offering better protection for larger HTLC values through proportional fee budgets. Additionally, by relying less on fee rate estimators and more on a structured RBF strategy, it aims to provide more consistent outcomes even when faced with rapid changes in mempool conditions.

Despite these improvements, the transition to a new on-chain logic comes with risks, including the potential introduction of bugs and vulnerabilities. The development team has addressed many serious issues during the review process, highlighting the importance of careful code modification and the value of simplicity in securing the network.

In conclusion, LND's reworked sweeper subsystem represents a significant step forward in the management of on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network, offering a more secure and efficient approach to transaction confirmation. Other Lightning implementations are encouraged to consider integrating similar budget-aware mechanisms into their fee bumping strategies to bolster network defenses and improve reliability.</summary>
