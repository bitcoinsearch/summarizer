    <summary>The discourse presents a nuanced exploration of the challenges and strategies associated with managing transaction linearizations within a networked system. It begins by acknowledging the efficiency gains from delegating the computation of transaction linearizations to relayers, entities that are inherently incentivized to possess or acquire such linearizations due to their role in forwarding transactions. This delegation not only optimizes computational resources but also places the onus of procurement on the most capable parties.

However, complications arise when a relayed transaction, complete with its linearization for integration into a recipient's transaction cluster, conflicts with an existing transaction within the recipient's cluster. The crux of the issue is ensuring network resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks without resorting to overly simplistic rejection criteria that could inadvertently facilitate such attacks. Specifically, the concern is that a blanket rule to reject non-exact matches could be exploited, rendering the relay process susceptible to disruption by attackers who flood the network with conflicting transactions targeting the same cluster.

To navigate this, the discussion advances the idea of merging overlapping linearizations from different sources, provided the resultant linearization improves upon the existing cluster without breaching anti-DoS protocols. This approach, however, is not without its vulnerabilities. It could potentially be manipulated by attackers who append transactions that, while seemingly beneficial due to fee bumps, actually serve to degrade the overall utility of the honest transaction's inclusion. Such scenarios underscore the inherent risks in relying solely on externally sourced linearizations for cluster updates, highlighting a potential vector for exploitation.

Nonetheless, the narrative shifts to a more optimistic perspective when considering the supplementary use of relayed linearizations alongside those computed independently by nodes. By integrating external linearizations as an additive rather than a substitutive measure, the system can harness the benefits of distributed computation without overly compromising security or efficiency. This dual-strategy underscores a pragmatic approach to enhancing network operations, emphasizing the importance of balancing openness with safeguards against manipulation.</summary>
