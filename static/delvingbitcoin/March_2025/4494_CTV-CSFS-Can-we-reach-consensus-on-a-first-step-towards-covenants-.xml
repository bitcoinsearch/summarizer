    <summary>In recent discussions with Blockstream engineers, it has been highlighted that the implementation of CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) could significantly enhance the operational efficiency and security of the Liquid network's timelock-fallback script. Currently, this script mandates periodic rolling of coins to maintain its integrity and functionality. The integration of CTV is proposed as a solution to streamline this process, potentially offering a more robust framework for managing these transactions. This improvement is not only applicable to the existing Liquid network infrastructure but may also extend its benefits to Liana, suggesting a broader applicability and impact on blockchain transaction management and security protocols.</summary>
