    <summary>The recent modifications to the graph have successfully clarified the delta steps on the MMEF axis. This enhancement is pivotal in providing a clearer visual representation, making it easier for viewers to understand the intricacies of the process being depicted. The inclusion of this updated graph contributes significantly to the comprehension of the mechanism at play, particularly in the context of PPLNS with Job Declaration.

By explicitly marking the $\delta$ steps on the MMEF axis, the adjustments offer a more intuitive grasp of the data and its implications. This improvement not only aids in the analytical assessment of the graph but also enriches the overall presentation by ensuring that critical information is immediately apparent to the observer.</summary>
