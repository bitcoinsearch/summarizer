    <summary>The discussion revolves around a proposal that has been well-received by the individual in question. However, the issue being pointed out is identified as orthogonal to the merits of the proposal itself, indicating that while the proposal is appreciated, there exists a separate concern or problem that stands independent of the proposal's potential benefits or drawbacks. This distinction underscores the complexity of evaluating ideas where multiple dimensions of assessment are necessary to fully understand their implications. The positive reception of the proposal suggests that it possesses qualities or solutions that are valuable, yet the acknowledgment of an orthogonal issue highlights the need for a broader perspective when considering its overall impact.</summary>
