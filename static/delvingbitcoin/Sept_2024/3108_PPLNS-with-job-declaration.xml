    <summary>The text outlines a specific stance on the evaluation of fees related to mined jobs within a certain context, emphasizing a neutral or unbiased approach towards the assessment of these fees. The focus is on the total fee paid for mined jobs, specifically in comparison to other jobs within the same category or slice. The methodology described implies that there is no penalization or negative bias involved in this process, suggesting that the approach taken is meant to be fair and impartial. This agnostic viewpoint ensures that the evaluation is based solely on the fees themselves, without allowing external factors to influence the assessment. Such an approach highlights the importance of a balanced and equitable evaluation method in the context discussed.</summary>
