    <summary>In the discussion of enhancing cryptographic practices, a proposed solution involves the publication of a hash of the private key alongside the proof. This method suggests including in the proof an assertion that the hash corresponds to the non-blinded public key. While this approach is presented as potentially simplistic or naive, it opens the door to more sophisticated methods of ensuring security and integrity within cryptographic systems. The suggestion implicitly acknowledges the need for continuous improvement and innovation in cryptographic methodologies, reflecting an ongoing quest for more secure, efficient, and reliable encryption practices.</summary>
