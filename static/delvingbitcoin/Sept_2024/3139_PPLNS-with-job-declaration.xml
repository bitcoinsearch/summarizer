    <summary>The primary challenge identified revolves around the inability to cache hashes, necessitating the recalculation of everything for each window. This issue underscores a significant inefficiency in the process, where the repetitive calculation not only increases computational load but also potentially delays the overall operation. The need for recalculating hashes for every window suggests that there might be a dynamic or variable aspect to the data being processed, which prevents the reuse of previously computed hashes.

This situation could imply a need for optimization or a reconsideration of the approach used for handling hashes. Possible solutions might involve exploring alternative hashing algorithms that could support caching or identifying patterns within the data that could allow for partial caching. Additionally, this challenge highlights the importance of efficient data processing strategies in situations where data dynamics or structures necessitate frequent recalculations.</summary>
