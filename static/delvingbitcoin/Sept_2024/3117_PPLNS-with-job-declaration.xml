    <summary>The email touches upon concerns regarding the dilution of shares within a pool or slice/window in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency mining pools. The sender acknowledges the usefulness of the current protocol but points out its vulnerability to the issue where all validation data utilized by miners is distributed by the pool, potentially leading to inefficiencies or unfair practices. They suggest that employing blinded signatures could offer a solution to make each proposal within the pool more robust, though they admit uncertainty on the exact implementation or appearance of such a solution. The sender expresses an intention to share more detailed insights or solutions once they have developed a clearer understanding or proposal on how to address the issue with blinded signatures effectively.</summary>
