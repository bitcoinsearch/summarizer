    <summary>The [bLIP-0028: Paratonnerre proposal](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/28) aims to enhance security by enabling the integration of a remote node with hardware wallets such as Ledger or Coldcard. This initiative is part of an effort to standardize control messages within the bLIP framework, addressing a critical aspect of cryptocurrency management and security. The inquiry about whether bLIP-0028 incorporates onion messaging highlights an interest in understanding the depth of privacy and security measures implemented in this proposal. Comparatively, there's curiosity regarding how bLIP-0028 differentiates itself from the functionalities offered by [vls.tech](https://vls.tech/), suggesting a landscape where various solutions aim to secure cryptocurrency transactions and manage invoices with merchants. The discussion points towards an exploration of bLIP-0028's complexity and feature set, especially in contrast to simpler solutions focused solely on facilitating invoice payments for merchants, indicating a broader spectrum of use cases that bLIP-0028 might cover beyond what has been proposed for straightforward merchant transactions.</summary>
