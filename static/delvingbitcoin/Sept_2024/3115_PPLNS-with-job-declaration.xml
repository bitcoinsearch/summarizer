    <summary>The email highlights concerns regarding the challenges faced by low-end nodes in the cryptocurrency mining ecosystem, emphasizing that pools and hashers should not bear the responsibility of acting as "benevolent guardians" for these nodes. It suggests that the issues experienced by these nodes would be more effectively addressed at the consensus level rather than through mining practices. The sender expresses hope that a solution will be found through the [GCC Revival](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710) initiative led by AntoineP, indicating optimism that this project could potentially alleviate the difficulties faced by less powerful nodes within the network. This perspective underscores the importance of finding systemic solutions to support the inclusivity and efficiency of mining operations, particularly for those with limited computational resources.</summary>
