    <summary>The recent update to B'SST, a project hosted on GitHub, marks a significant transition from a proprietary license to AGPLv3 with its version update from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4. This change primarily aims to address the concerns and limitations imposed by the previous licensing model. Despite the core of the update focusing on the licensing shift, it includes a minor fix alongside. The decision to publicly announce this update emphasizes the developer's intention to inform current and potential users about the enhanced accessibility and openness of B'SST under the AGPLv3 license. For further details, interested individuals can visit the project's repository [here](https://github.com/dgpv/bsst). This move potentially broadens the user base by removing barriers previously established under the proprietary license, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative development environment.</summary>
