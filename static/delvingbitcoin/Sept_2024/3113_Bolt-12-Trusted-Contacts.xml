    <summary>The discussion revolves around the utilization of a distinct `invreq_payer_id` for every contact, highlighting its significance in enhancing privacy and security. The primary rationale behind this approach is domain separation. By employing separate keys for communication with different nodes, it mitigates risks associated with privacy breaches and security threats. This practice is particularly prudent given that these keys are frequently used to perform cryptographic signatures, underscoring the need for stringent measures to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.</summary>
