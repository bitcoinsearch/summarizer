    <summary>The recent update to the extension specification introduces the [PHash](https://github.com/demand-open-source/share-accounting-ext/blob/e25659ff92505913e1b8c87354751b46e198726d/extension.mdphash) data type, which is crucial for miners in verifying the work associated with each share. The PHash message encompasses both the previous hash and the starting index of slices utilizing this hash. This specific information is conveyed as part of the [GetWindowSuccess](https://github.com/demand-open-source/share-accounting-ext/blob/e25659ff92505913e1b8c87354751b46e198726d/extension.mdgetwindowsuccess-server---client) response. Such a mechanism facilitates miners in accurately identifying the slices related to each previous hash. The ability to map each share to its preceding hash is fundamental in the process of validating the computational work done for each share, ensuring integrity and accountability in the mining process.</summary>
