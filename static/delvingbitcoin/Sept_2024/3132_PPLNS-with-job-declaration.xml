    <summary>When discussing the technicalities of data verification within a distributed system, one crucial aspect is how each share of data comes with its own Merkle path. This inclusion is pivotal for ensuring that any participant or system can verify the authenticity and integrity of the shared data without needing access to the entire dataset. The Merkle path facilitates this by providing a cryptographic proof of inclusion, allowing each share to be independently verified against the overall dataset's root hash. This mechanism enhances security and efficiency in distributed systems by enabling selective data sharing and verification, rather than requiring the transmission and verification of the full data set. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where bandwidth or storage is limited, or where privacy concerns necessitate minimal data exposure.</summary>
