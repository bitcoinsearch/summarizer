    <summary>The original document highlights a nuanced approach towards managing reputation within a network, specifically addressing the responsibility of preimage release and its implications on delayed resolution. The concept introduces a shift in perspective by suggesting that the downstream is fundamentally accountable for such releases, leading to reconsideration of the value of tracking incoming reputation. This shifts attention to the potential benefits and drawbacks of an outgoing-only reputation system, particularly in the context of managing endorsed payments and the efficiency of payment resolution across the network.

The discussion extends into the mechanics of how payments are processed and the role of reputation in ensuring the smooth operation of these transactions. The introduction of a bidirectional algorithm is mentioned, which proposes failing endorsed payments if any node along the payment path lacks sufficient outgoing reputation. This raises a question about the necessity of incoming reputation signals, as their absence might not significantly impact the network's functionality. The argument suggests that focusing solely on local outgoing reputation could streamline operations, as nodes would base decisions on forwarding or failing payments on their immediate assessment rather than historical interactions. 

Moreover, the text delves into the practical implications of adopting an outgoing-only reputation model. One key point is that endorsing a Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) under this model does not stake a nodeâ€™s reputation on the payment resolving quickly; rather, it indicates a willingness to utilize endorsed slots throughout the entire payment path. Another implication is the strategic preference for unendorsed payments during periods of low risk ("peacetime") to avoid unnecessary fees, highlighting a tactical aspect of network participation. Additionally, the accessibility for new nodes is discussed, suggesting that while new participants can immediately engage in sending payments through endorsed slots, receiving payments requires them to first establish a sufficient reputation. This distinction aims to balance user experience with network security, especially in critical conditions referred to as "wartime."

This summary encapsulates the considerations and potential shifts in strategy regarding the management of reputation within a network, emphasizing the importance of efficient, secure payment processing and the role of reputation signals in achieving these goals.</summary>
