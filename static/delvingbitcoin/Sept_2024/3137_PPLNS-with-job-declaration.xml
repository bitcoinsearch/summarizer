    <summary>Utilizing the share index to establish the order of a Merkle tree for a slice addresses potential issues previously highlighted. This methodology not only mitigates those concerns but also offers clients a preview of what they might expect from the Merkle path corresponding to a specific share. Such an approach enhances the robustness of data integrity verification processes by providing a structured and predictable framework for organizing shares within a Merkle tree. This, in turn, facilitates more efficient and accurate client-side validations of data authenticity and integrity.</summary>
