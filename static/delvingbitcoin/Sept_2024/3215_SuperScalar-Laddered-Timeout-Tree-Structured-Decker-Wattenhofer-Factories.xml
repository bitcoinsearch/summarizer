    <summary>In the realm of service provision, particularly when unilateral exit costs fall predominantly on the shoulders of the Service Provider (LSP), a distinct set of incentives emerges. These incentives are crucial for maintaining a healthy and beneficial relationship between the LSP and its clients. Firstly, there's a strong motivation for the LSP to ensure the delivery of exemplary service. This high standard of service aims to diminish the client's inclination towards unilateral exit, encouraging them instead to opt for an assisted exit. The logic here is straightforward: superior service quality reduces the likelihood of clients wanting to terminate their association unilaterally.

Furthermore, the LSP is incentivized to become operational as quickly as possible and to synchronize its online presence with the timing of batch operations at timeout maturity. This strategy is primarily aimed at mitigating the risks associated with unilateral exits, whether these are accidental or intentional. By aligning their operational timeline with these critical junctures, LSPs can better safeguard themselves against premature service terminations that could lead to financial losses.

Lastly, the selection of clients becomes a critical factor under these circumstances. Given the potential financial implications of unilateral exits, LSPs are encouraged to be more selective in their client intake process. This selectiveness is not merely about avoiding financial drains but also about ensuring a smoother, more reliable service provision process. In essence, by being choosy about whom they serve, LSPs can better manage risks and foster a more stable and mutually beneficial service environment.

The discussion encapsulates the complex interplay of incentives and strategies that come into play when unilateral exit costs are predominantly borne by LSPs. It highlights that there is no simple solution to this dynamic; instead, there are various trade-offs that LSPs must navigate to maintain equilibrium in their service provision model.</summary>
