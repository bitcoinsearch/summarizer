    <summary>The proposal in question introduces a concept that would be more fitting as a bLIP rather than an amendment to the existing BOLT specifications. This distinction is crucial as it underscores the optional nature of the proposed feature, ensuring that the standard operations of BOLT12 remain unaffected for users who may choose not to adopt this new proposal. The essence of the proposal is available for further review at [delvingbitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bolt-12-trusted-contacts/1046), which provides comprehensive insights into how the implementation of trusted contacts within the framework of BOLT12 could be structured without disrupting the core functionalities of the system. This approach allows for an augmentation of BOLT12's capabilities while maintaining its foundational integrity and usability for those who opt out of the new feature.</summary>
