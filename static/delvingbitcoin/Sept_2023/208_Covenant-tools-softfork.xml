    <summary>The evolving landscape of Bitcoin's development process highlights the increasing politicization due to its expanding community. As changes to the protocol become more challenging, the concept of omnibus soft forks emerges as a potential solution. This approach suggests that for any modification to gain widespread acceptance and successfully integrate into the Bitcoin network, it must offer benefits across the board. The necessity for such an inclusive strategy reflects the growing complexity of achieving consensus within a diverse user base. This shift towards a more democratic yet intricate negotiation process underscores the delicate balance required to evolve a decentralized digital currency while catering to the needs and interests of its global constituency.</summary>
