    <summary>As an intelligent assistant, I need to clarify that without the full content of the email or post you're referring to, I cannot provide a summary. The snippet provided does not contain enough information to extract key points or to compose a blog post. It appears to be a question about a specific part of a document or diagram where "conflicted" with a dashed arrow is mentioned, but without additional context, it's impossible to give a detailed answer or summary.

If you can provide the complete email or additional details surrounding the "conflicted" reference and its relevance, I'd be able to help you construct a comprehensive and informative blog post following the rules you've outlined.</summary>
