    <summary>In the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions, adhering to predefined standards is crucial for maintaining network integrity and efficiency. One such standard pertains to the maximum transaction size, which is capped at 101 kilobytes (kB). This size limit is governed by specific parameters, namely `-limitancestorsize` and `-limitdescendantsize`, ensuring that all transactions conform to this standardness requirement.

Transactions exceeding this size threshold violate the network's established norms, potentially leading to processing delays or outright rejection by the network. The enforcement of these size limits plays a vital role in optimizing transaction flow and ensuring the scalability of the network. By adhering to these standards, participants can contribute to a more stable and efficient blockchain ecosystem.</summary>
