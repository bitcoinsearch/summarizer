    <summary>The issue of `bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent: 1376` primarily points to transactions that are either missing or have already been spent, suggesting these could be orphaned transactions. The inquiry emphasizes the importance of examining what occurs later in the transaction orphanage to understand the full scope of the problem. Orphaned transactions are those that reference inputs not yet available in the block being referenced, which may later be resolved as blocks are added to the blockchain. This indicates a need for a thorough investigation into how such transactions are handled subsequently within the system to ensure they are either properly linked to their parent transactions or discarded if found to be invalid.</summary>
