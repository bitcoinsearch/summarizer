    <summary>The introduction of a new Tapscript leaf version in Bitcoin script execution aims to address previous concerns by generalizing the sigops budget into what is now referred to as the varops budget, which applies across all operations. This adjustment was primarily motivated by the need to counteract denial-of-service attacks that leveraged excessive computational time and memory usage. The varops budget is linked to transaction weight, allowing for larger transactions to have more compute units proportionally, with the rate set at 5,200 units per weight unit. To ensure efficiency and feasibility, benchmarking has become crucial, focusing on block-sized scripts limited to 4M weight units, translating to a varops budget of 20.8 billion compute units. Tests on various operational patterns, including hashing loops and bit operations, aim to identify slow script validation scenarios under this new system, using signature validations, particularly with Schnorr signatures, as a comparison benchmark.
Community involvement is emphasized for refining the varops budget, with developers encouraged to participate by engaging with the GSR prototype implementation. Their contributions, especially through benchmark results detailing script performances and Schnorr checksig times, are invaluable for tailoring the varops budget to different systems. This collaborative effort is crucial for adjusting and validating the proposed budget to ensure its reliability and functionality across various hardware. Further details and opportunities for contribution can be found through provided GitHub links to both the BIP documentation and the GSR prototype implementation branch.
Additionally, discussions on benchmarking strategies highlight the importance of specifying build options accurately for comparable results and propose a repository for sharing benchmark data. Despite some script errors leading to inconclusive data points, the focus remains on capturing worst-case scenarios rather than exhaustive opcode performance analysis. The evaluation suggests that while certain hashing algorithms and operation costs appear variable across different hardware, assigning distinct varops costs based on these differences may not be practical due to their dependency on specific implementations. This insight into operational costs, alongside the challenges in measuring performance relative to input sizes, underscores the complexity of establishing a balanced and effective varops budget.</summary>
