    <summary>The v31.0 release of Bitcoin Core celebrates a decade since it shifted from OpenSSL to libsecp256k1 for ECDSA signature validation, a move that significantly sped up the process. This improvement, highlighted by Pieter Wuille, made signature validation 2.5 to 5.5 times faster. The performance gap has only widened thanks to ongoing enhancements, emphasizing libsecp256k1's focus on elliptic curve cryptography for the secp256k1 curve, unlike OpenSSL which aims for a broader cryptographic toolkit. A unique benchmarking technique was employed to compare both libraries across various versions, revealing libsecp256k1's superior performance in signature verification speed. This methodology involved dynamic loading to test each library version using input data generated by a statically linked version of libsecp256k1, ensuring a fair comparison. The results showed significant speedups in specific versions of libsecp256k1 due to optimizations like the GLV endomorphism and safegcd-based modular inverses, making it over eight times faster than OpenSSL in verifying ECDSA signatures on the secp256k1 curve.
Further analysis on script performance using a Ryzen 5950X CPU with 500,000 iterations exposed a variance in speed ratios, including an 8% speed increase in bc-27.0 attributed to the removal of x86_64 assembly. This discrepancy highlights the importance of considering hardware diversity and compiler optimizations in benchmarking efforts. The benchmarks maintained fairness by using identical hardware and compilers, despite the original code being optimized for a variety of hardware available at the time. This approach reveals how advancements in compilers have narrowed the performance gap between field assembly code and pure C machine code, leading to the removal of x86_64 assembly in version 0.4.1.
The concept of creating a graph to visualize software development and performance improvements over time was proposed, focusing on using a logarithmic scale on the Y-axis to accurately represent proportional changes and ensure readability as new updates are introduced. This structure allows for a clear depiction of the project's evolution and incremental advancements, enhancing the understanding and engagement of stakeholders. A commit has been pushed to include a &quot;date&quot; column in the benchmarking data, facilitating the creation of such graphs. This addition aims to make it easier to track the development milestones and performance enhancements of libsecp256k1 over time, offering a valuable tool for analysis and presentation.</summary>
