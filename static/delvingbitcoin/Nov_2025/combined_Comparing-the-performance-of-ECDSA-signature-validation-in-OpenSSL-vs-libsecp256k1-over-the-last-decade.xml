    <summary>The v31.0 release of Bitcoin Core represents a significant milestone, marking a decade since the pivotal shift from OpenSSL to libsecp256k1 for ECDSA signature validation in its consensus code. This transition, initiated with patch [6954](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6954) in November 2015 and officially introduced in version 0.12, significantly enhanced performance by making signature validation up to 5.5 times faster than its predecessor, as noted by Pieter Wuille, the creator of libsecp256k1. The advancement in performance was just the beginning, as ongoing improvements have consistently expanded the performance gap between libsecp256k1 and OpenSSL, which, despite its broader scope as a general-purpose cryptography toolkit, has not kept pace with the specific advancements in elliptic curve cryptography made by libsecp256k1, especially regarding the secp256k1 curve.
A unique benchmarking approach was utilized to measure the speed improvements across various versions of OpenSSL and libsecp256k1. This method involved dynamically loading each library version to test against a set of benchmarks, a process detailed on GitHub ([secp256k1-plugbench](https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1-plugbench)). This technique allowed for a fair and consistent comparison of the libraries' performances over time, demonstrating libsecp256k1's superior capability in verifying ECDSA signatures on the secp256k1 curve. Notably, specific updates in libsecp256k1 delivered considerable speedups, with a roughly 28% increase from bc-0.19 to bc-0.20 through the activation of GLV endomorphism optimization, and approximately a 30% improvement from bc-0.20 to bc-22.0 due to the introduction of safegcd-based modular inverses.
The comparison further highlighted that while there have been no significant performance improvements in OpenSSL over the years, libsecp256k1 has continuously optimized its operations for the secp256k1 curve, resulting in more than an 8x speed advantage over the latest OpenSSL version for ECDSA signature verification on this specific curve. Despite this, there has been a recent initiative to enhance OpenSSL’s handling of the secp256k1 curve, indicating a potential acknowledgment within the broader cryptographic community of the importance of optimized support for this curve.
Recent benchmarks run on a Ryzen 5950X CPU with 500,000 iterations revealed an 8.5 speed ratio favoring libsecp256k1 over OpenSSL. These results showed an 8% speed up in libsecp256k1 v0.4.1, attributed to the removal of x86_64 assembly code, highlighting the evolving nature of performance enhancements in response to advancements in hardware and compiler capabilities. However, it's crucial to consider potential biases in these numbers, such as the uniform hardware and compiler used for testing, which may not accurately reflect the diversity of environments and technological progress over time.
The discussion around generating a graph to visualize performance improvements over time suggests an interest in further analyzing and communicating the development and optimization trajectory of libsecp256k1, potentially offering insights into the library's efficiency gains and the technological shifts influencing these advancements.</summary>
