    <summary>In the domain of programming, especially when dealing with cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology, understanding the roles and limitations of certain tools is paramount. Output descriptors are a case in point. They serve the specific purpose of describing outputs, as their name suggests. This is crucial because without the supplementary information that comes from scanned transactions, output descriptors are essentially incomplete. Their functionality is inherently dependent on external data sources for generating any meaningful output.

This necessitates a clear definition and understanding of what output descriptors can and cannot do on their own. The core limitation lies in their inability to generate outputs without accessing information from scanned transactions. This highlights the need for comprehensive documentation and precise definitions when working with output descriptors to avoid any confusion regarding their capabilities and limitations. Understanding these constraints is vital for developers working in fields that require transaction analysis and interpretation.</summary>
