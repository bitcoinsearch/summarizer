    <summary>Starkware possesses the necessary resources and reputation to potentially emulate `OP_STARK_VERIFY` along with other opcodes critical for secure bridging to side systems. The proposed method involves cosigning transparent scripts embedded within an `OP_FALSE OP_IF &lt;.&gt; OP_ELSE OP_ENDIF` structure. This approach is suggested as a means for Starkware to offer a public service that allows for experimentation prior to a soft fork. The argument for a soft fork could be strengthened by the existence of a live, transparent system already handling significant financial transactions.

An interesting technical suggestion made is the replacement of `OP_FALSE` with `OP_FALSE OP_NOPX`. This modification implies that during a soft fork, the `OP_NOPX` could act to change `OP_FALSE` to `OP_TRUE` without requiring explicit permission from the committee responsible for cosigning the emulation. This technique suggests a seamless transition mechanism for the soft fork, potentially simplifying the implementation process and reducing reliance on external approvals.</summary>
