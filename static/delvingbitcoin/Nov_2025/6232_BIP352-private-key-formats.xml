    <summary>In a detailed analysis of the performance impact of adding labels to transactions, it's emphasized that each new label requires at least an elliptic curve (EC) point addition. This process also involves a comparison against all possible outputs for every transaction being analyzed. To provide concrete evidence supporting this claim, benchmarking figures were sourced from tests conducted using [Frigate](https://github.com/sparrowwallet/frigate). The testing environment consisted of a machine equipped with 8x RTX 3060 GPUs and spanned over a 64-week period. These figures were presented as a counterargument to a previously held belief, showcasing the computational demands imposed by additional transaction labeling.</summary>
