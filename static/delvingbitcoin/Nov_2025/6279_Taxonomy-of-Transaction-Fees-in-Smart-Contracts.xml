    <summary>The discussion highlights a crucial aspect of the mining process related to permissioning and fee acquisition. A specific pseudocode example, `100 op_csv op_checksigverify`, was acknowledged as an insightful catch, pointing towards an intricate detail in how transactions are verified and how fees are collected within this system. This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of mining operations, especially when it comes to the necessity for wallets to be aware of and to possess a copy of transactions for fees to be obtained. 

This scenario brings to light the largest systemic drawback of the discussed approach: it effectively makes mining a permissioned activity. The implication is that without the requisite knowledge and access provided to the wallets, miners cannot claim the fees they would typically earn for their computational efforts. This requirement introduces an additional layer of complexity and dependency, potentially affecting the efficiency and openness of mining activities.</summary>
