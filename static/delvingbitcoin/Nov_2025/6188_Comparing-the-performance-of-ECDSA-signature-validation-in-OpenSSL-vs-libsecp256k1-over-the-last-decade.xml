    <summary>The email discusses a recent update made to a project repository. A commit has been pushed to include a new "date" column in the generated .csv file for each benchmarked version. This addition is formatted in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd), aimed at improving data organization and facilitating future analysis, specifically for creating graphs that can effectively illustrate changes over time. The sender acknowledges the need to update an existing script, plot.py, to accommodate this new column but mentions plans to address this task later in the week. Furthermore, the sender invites others to contribute, particularly in enhancing the plotting functionality, admitting to having minimal skills in this area. The codebase, including the new feature, is openly accessible for contributions, with the specific commit available for review at [theStack’s GitHub](https://github.com/theStack/secp256k1-plugbench/commit/202d6358e48c31afcbee094992b617088be3d75d). This open invitation encourages collaboration, aiming to leverage community skills to improve the project’s data visualization capabilities.</summary>
