    <summary>The inquiry centers on the feasibility of implementing a security measure against attackers by integrating a 4-bit checksum, which would ostensibly necessitate additional computational effort on their part. However, the effectiveness of this approach is qualified by recognizing that if the checksum remains constant, it doesn't genuinely create a quadratic problem for the attacker but rather introduces a form of hardening with a specified number of iterations (c iterations). The proposal suggests setting a computational target time of approximately 2 seconds for verifying a single signature. This duration is strategically chosen to ensure that any attempt by an attacker to leak more than one bit of information at a time becomes significantly detectable and presumably impractical. The fundamental question raised pertains to identifying any potential flaws or oversights in adopting such a strategy for enhancing security measures.</summary>
