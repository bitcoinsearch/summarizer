    <summary>The core of the inquiry revolves around the conditions that make an attack feasible, particularly focusing on scenarios where a significant difficulty adjustment, specifically the 4x upwards limit, is activated. This stipulation suggests a vulnerability inherent to situations where such an adjustment occurs, pointing towards a potential for exploitation. The proposed solution to mitigate this risk involves a temporal regulation mechanism, essentially mandating that the last timestamp in any given window must be at least 3.5 days subsequent to the first timestamp. This measure aims to neutralize the impact of the 4x limit by ensuring that the timeframe for adjustments adheres to a minimum duration, thus indirectly addressing and potentially circumventing the exploitability associated with rapid difficulty increases.</summary>
