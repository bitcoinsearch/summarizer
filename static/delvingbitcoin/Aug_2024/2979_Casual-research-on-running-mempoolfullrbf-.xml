    <summary>The provided information highlights an ongoing project related to analyzing CSV data, which is accessible through a GitHub repository located at [https://github.com/ValuedMammal/mempool-util/tree/main/assets](https://github.com/ValuedMammal/mempool-util/tree/main/assets). Despite the progress made, there's a notable task pending in the project's completion: conducting an analysis of variance. This indicates that the project is in an advanced stage, focusing on statistical methods to understand the variability within the data. The mention of the analysis of variance suggests a deep dive into the data set is required to identify any significant differences between groups, which is crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions from the data. This step is essential for ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings derived from the CSV data.</summary>
