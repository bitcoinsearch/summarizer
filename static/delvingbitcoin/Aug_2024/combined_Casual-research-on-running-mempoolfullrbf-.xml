    <summary>The ongoing project discussed involves a detailed examination of CSV data aimed at understanding transaction data within newly confirmed blocks. The work is currently shared on a GitHub repository, which can be accessed through the provided [link](https://github.com/ValuedMammal/mempool-util/tree/main/assets). An important aspect yet to be addressed in this project is the analysis of variance. This statistical method is critical for assessing the variability in the data set, which will help in identifying significant differences between groups. Such an analysis is pivotal for ensuring that conclusions drawn from the data are both reliable and valid. Further insights into the project, including its scope and current status, are available on a website hosted at [https://valuedmammal.github.io/](https://valuedmammal.github.io/). The project's focus on using a fraction of block transaction data as expected by a node's recent block template suggests a sophisticated approach to analyzing blockchain transactions and their predictability.</summary>
