    <summary>The concern raised addresses the complexity of securing devices against threats not limited to malicious software or firmware but extends to the physical construction of the device itself. This introduces a nuanced challenge in cybersecurity, emphasizing that anti-exfiltration measures might not be sufficient in scenarios where a device is inherently designed with malicious intent. The risk encompasses potential vulnerabilities from side channel and radio frequency leaks, underscoring a distinct category of threat that requires consideration beyond the conventional software and firmware security practices. This distinction highlights the need for a broader approach to device security, acknowledging that safeguarding against external software threats does not necessarily equate to protection against all possible forms of compromise.</summary>
