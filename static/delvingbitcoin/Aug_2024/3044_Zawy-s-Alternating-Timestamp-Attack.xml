    <summary>The discussion revolves around the differentiation between "the future" as perceived in terms of wall clock time and "the latter," which is specified to refer to block timestamps within a blockchain context. The clarification sought is on the proper interpretation of these terms, specifically in relation to the acceptance criteria for blocks in a blockchain network. It is suggested that blocks should not be accepted if their timestamp exceeds the node's current wall clock time by more than two hours. This policy aims to maintain the integrity and chronological order of the blockchain, ensuring that blocks are processed in a timely manner relative to the real-world time experienced by the nodes participating in the network.</summary>
