    <summary>The email discussion highlights a disagreement about the necessity of introducing a new consensus rule for Bitcoin, specifically concerning its merkle tree structure. The sender references a previous debate regarding the [milk sad disclosure](https://milksad.info/disclosure.htmllibbitcoin-team-response-and-context), suggesting that the current argument mirrors past discussions where the effectiveness of referencing similar past situations was questioned. The sender criticizes the proposal for a new consensus rule, labeling it as unnecessary and attributing the advocacy for such a change to what they describe as "limited propagation of knowledge." This criticism points towards an underlying concern about the rationale behind proposing changes to Bitcoin's foundational technologies and questions the necessity and motivation for altering established consensus protocols.</summary>
