    <summary>The discussion revolves around the introduction of a new consensus rule aimed at addressing a security issue related to SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) proofs. The primary motive behind this proposal was not merely to optimize wallet functionality or to achieve bandwidth savings, although these were considered modest benefits. The essence of the controversy lies in the perception that the security problem being addressed is both suboptimal and unnecessary to fix through such a measure. Introducing a new consensus rule, especially under the assumption that it would be implemented via a roll-up soft fork, is highlighted as a significant step that warrants careful consideration. The critique suggests that the justification for this proposed rule does not sufficiently account for the complexities and potential drawbacks associated with its implementation, implying that its current consideration may be premature.</summary>
