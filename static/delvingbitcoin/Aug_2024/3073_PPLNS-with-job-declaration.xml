    <summary>The development of an SV2 extension aimed at enhancing the transparency and fairness in mining pool payouts is underway. This extension allows miners greater control by enabling them to select transactions, thereby choosing mining jobs with different fee structures. This initiative builds upon the Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) system, which is further elaborated in a proposal accessible [here](https://github.com/demand-open-source/pplns-with-job-declaration/blob/bd7258db08e843a5d3732bec225644eda6923e48/pplns-with-job-declaration.pdf). The specifics of the extension and its operational framework can be found in the specification document hosted on GitHub, available through this [link](https://github.com/demand-open-source/share-accounting-ext/blob/281c1cbc4f9a07b21a443753a525197dc5d8e18c/extension.md). It's important to note that the project is still in the developmental phase, actively seeking reviews and contributions to refine and finalize the proposed system.</summary>
