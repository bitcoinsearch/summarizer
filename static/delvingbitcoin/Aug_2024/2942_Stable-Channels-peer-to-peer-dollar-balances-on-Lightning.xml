    <title>Stable Channels - peer-to-peer dollar balances on Lightning</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the irony inherent in the performance and reliability of channels found within the Lightning Network. Despite their pivotal role in facilitating transactions and maintaining the network's efficiency, these channels are often characterized by a notable lack of stability. This instability can impact the overall functioning of the Lightning Network, affecting transaction speeds, reliability, and user experience. The paradox lies in the expectation that these channels, as integral components of the Lightning Network's infrastructure, should exhibit a high degree of reliability and stability to ensure seamless operations. Yet, the reality is quite different, with these channels frequently becoming bottlenecks or points of failure within the system. This situation underscores a significant challenge facing the Lightning Network: enhancing the stability and dependability of its channels to improve the network's performance and user satisfaction.</summary>
