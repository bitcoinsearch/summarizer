    <summary>The standalone repository mentioned is designed for mining Proof of Work (PoW) faucet coins and is accessible for use with a core node. This is an alternative to the requirement of running an inquisition node locally, which simplifies the mining process for users. The repository can be found at [https://github.com/ajtowns/powcoins](https://github.com/ajtowns/powcoins). This setup underscores a more user-friendly approach to engaging with cryptocurrency mining by reducing the technical barriers traditionally associated with the mining process.</summary>
