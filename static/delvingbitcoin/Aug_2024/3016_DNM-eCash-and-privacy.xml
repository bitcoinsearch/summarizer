    <summary>Lightning Network (LN) faces significant limitations in providing proper escrow services, a crucial requirement for the operation of anonymous markets. These platforms necessitate mechanisms to mitigate the risk associated with fraudulent sellers who may accept irreversible payments and fail to deliver on their promises. The primary role of Darknet Market (DNM) operators is to manage this risk, ensuring that transactions between buyers and sellers are conducted in a secure and trustworthy manner. Without effective escrow capabilities, LN struggles to meet the needs of these markets, highlighting a critical area where improvements are necessary to support the anonymity and security demands of users engaged in such transactions.</summary>
