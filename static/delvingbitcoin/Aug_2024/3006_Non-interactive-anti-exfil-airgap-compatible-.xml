    <summary>The term "vector commitment" is used in a way that might lead to confusion, especially since it already has a distinct significance within the field of cryptography, as detailed in a [document](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/495.pdf) on cryptographic techniques. The current discussion seems to align more closely with Scheme 2 outlined in discussions found on the [Linux Foundation's website](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2020-March/017667.html). This particular scheme is notable for its application to ECDSA rather than Schnorr signatures, drawing upon an idea originally proposed by Greg Maxwell in 2014, which can be reviewed in a forum post on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=893898.msg9861102msg9861102).</summary>
