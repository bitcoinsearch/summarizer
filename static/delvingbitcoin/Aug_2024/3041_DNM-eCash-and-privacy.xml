    <summary>The Lightning Network (LN) possesses the foundational capability to function as a proper escrow service. This potential hinges on the creation of the payment hash preimage by the escrow operator, which is subsequently released to the payment recipient once the escrow operator confirms that the goods have been delivered. However, it's important to note that the current implementation of LN, specifically LND, lacks the built-in functionality to support this type of escrow service. Despite this limitation, the underlying design of LN is flexible enough to be modified relatively easily to accommodate escrow operations, indicating that while LN in its present form does not offer proper escrow services, adjustments could be made to enable such functionalities in the future.</summary>
