    <summary>The discussion raises concerns about the potential noise introduced by utilizing a five-minute snapshot interval, particularly in relation to full-RBF (Replace-By-Fee) replacements. The core of the issue stems from the observation that transactions replaced under the full-RBF policy are more prone to subsequent replacements within a short timeframe compared to those not replaced. Consequently, these transactions might consistently appear as missing in analyses conducted under both configurations. An alternative approach suggested involves measuring the frequency of transactions that must be retrieved from peers following a block announcement, hinting at a more accurate method to gauge transaction replacement dynamics. The message also references @0xB10C, inquiring if they had recently published any relevant data or findings on this matter, indicating a community or previous discussions around this topic.</summary>
