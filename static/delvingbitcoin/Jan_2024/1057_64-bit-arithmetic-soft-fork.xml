    <summary>The recent review of OP_TLUV mailing list posts has highlighted the necessity for 64-bit arithmetic as an integral part of enabling TLUV and potentially benefiting other protocols. Developers from various protocols have expressed interest in the utility of 64-bit operations within their systems. To address this need, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been crafted and made available for public scrutiny at [BIP proposal link](https://github.com/Christewart/bips/pull/1). In addition, an implementation that aligns with this proposal has been developed and can be reviewed at [implementation link](https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/pull/2). The author of these developments is seeking early feedback on the proposal and its implementation and recognizes that the forum might not be the traditional platform for such discussions. Regardless, the initiative to gather preliminary impressions is seen as a step toward refining the proposal before it is presented to the broader mailing list.</summary>
