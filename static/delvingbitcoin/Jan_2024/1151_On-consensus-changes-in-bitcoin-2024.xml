    <summary>The recent correspondence highlights a discussion about the implications of not publishing LOT=FALSE clients and observing the resulting scenario. It is acknowledged that this approach aligns with previously shared views, given that it presents a binary outcome: the activation either occurs safely with minimal loss of users or computing power, or it fails to do so. This strategy operates under a 95% threshold, which serves as a decisive factor in determining the success or failure of the activation. The conversation reflects an agreement on the potential outcomes and appears to be a strategic decision rooted in past insights and understandings within the programming community.</summary>
