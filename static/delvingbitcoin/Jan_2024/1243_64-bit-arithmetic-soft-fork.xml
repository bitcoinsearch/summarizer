    <summary>Future advancements in Script programming will alleviate the need for programmers to factor in `SCRIPT_VERIFY_MINIMAL_DATA` while developing their scripts. This marks a significant shift from the practices of 'Legacy' script developers, who have historically had to account for this consideration due to policy reasons. It is noteworthy, however, that current policy stands firm and any changes to it remain unforeseen. The previous explanation may have lacked clarity, and for that, an apology has been extended. 

This evolution in scripting practice reflects an ongoing maturation within the field, signifying a move towards more streamlined coding processes. As such, the distinction between future and legacy Script programmers becomes increasingly pivotal, with the former poised to operate under a simplified set of considerations, thus potentially enhancing efficiency and reducing complexity in script creation.</summary>
