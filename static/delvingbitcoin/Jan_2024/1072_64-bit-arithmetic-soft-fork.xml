    <summary>The correspondence raises concerns regarding the implementation of a new encoding system for numbers in a proposed consensus change. It questions the necessity of introducing an entirely new encoding instead of expanding the capacity of existing opcodes to accommodate larger input values. The suggestion is made to consider an alternative approach, such as incorporating an `OP_ENABLE64BIT`, which would enable support for 64-bit input values without the need to duplicate current opcodes. By doing so, it is argued that this would help conserve the limited opcode namespace and minimize potential confusion among users. This alternative method is implied to be more efficient and less convoluted than creating a new number encoding system, advocating for a more streamlined modification to the existing framework.</summary>
