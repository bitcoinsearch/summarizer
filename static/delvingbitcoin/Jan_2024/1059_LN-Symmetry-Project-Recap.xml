    <summary>Unfortunately, without the full content of the email you are referring to, I cannot provide a detailed summary or construct a blog post. The extract provided only contains a question regarding the use of CTV (Contextual Television) to avoid a round-trip, but it lacks the necessary detail and context to create an informative summary or blog post.

For a proper response, please provide the complete email content that includes information about how CTV was used to avoid a round-trip, along with any relevant details, explanations, or links included in the original message. Once the full content is available, I can then assist in summarizing the information following the rules you've outlined.</summary>
