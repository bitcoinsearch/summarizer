    <summary>When considering the implementation of overflow checks in programming, the strategy of performing these checks after each 64-bit arithmetic operation comes into question. It is suggested that an alternative approach might be to allow computations with integers of arbitrary width and then detect overflows only when converting to LE64 or LE32 data types. While adding a VERIFY command after each 64-bit arithmetic operation may seem straightforward and not particularly burdensome mentally, it does have the consequence of increasing the script size.

However, one must be cautious about omitting the VERIFY step in such scenarios, especially within the Elements system. Neglecting to include the verification could lead to unforeseen behaviors in the event of an actual overflow occurrence. This emphasizes the importance of being vigilant in the implementation of safety checks in coding practices to ensure that the systems operate reliably and as expected even when handling edge cases involving possible integer overflows.</summary>
