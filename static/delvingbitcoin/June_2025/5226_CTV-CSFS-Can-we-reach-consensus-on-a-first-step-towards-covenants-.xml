    <summary>Greg has submitted a pull request (PR) on GitHub aiming to introduce the Combined Schnorr Signature Framework (CSFS) into the Inquisition project, which essentially integrates both CTV (CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY) and CSFS functionalities. This development is significant as it represents a notable proposal for enhancing the project's capabilities. However, it's concerning that this PR has not received any attention or reviews from the community or other developers in over three months. The lack of engagement with such contributions could potentially hinder the progress and innovation within the project. For those interested in exploring or contributing to this effort, more details can be found in the pull request [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/pull/72).</summary>
