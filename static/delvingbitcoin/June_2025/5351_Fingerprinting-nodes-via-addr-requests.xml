    <summary>The data in question encompasses a total of 894 IPv4 nodes, along with 42 clusters. A noteworthy observation within this dataset is the existence of small clusters that exhibit both IPv4 and IPv6 responses. This dual-response characteristic sets them apart from the majority of nodes, which exclusively responded via IPv4. The identification of these unique clusters suggests a nuanced approach to data analysis, highlighting the importance of considering both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols when examining network structures and behaviors. The presence of IPv6 capabilities within these clusters could indicate advanced networking configurations or future-proofing strategies employed by the administrators of these nodes. This differentiation not only enriches the dataset but also opens avenues for more detailed investigations into the interoperability and transition strategies between IPv4 and IPv6 within networked environments.</summary>
