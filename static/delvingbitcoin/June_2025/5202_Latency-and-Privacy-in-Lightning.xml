    <summary>The discussion revolves around the consideration of different options concerning time resolution in a specific context, with a focus on whether to maintain millisecond resolution or consider alternatives. The individual expressing their opinion is inclined towards retaining the current millisecond resolution for time measurements. They argue that addressing actual issues should not be deferred by obscuring them through less precise measures. This stance is rooted in the belief that if latency is a significant concern for users, they will seek out methods to accurately measure it, irrespective of the default system settings.

Furthermore, the individual advises against limiting the system's capabilities based on speculative future scenarios. The underlying message emphasizes the importance of dealing with present challenges without compromising system functionality for theoretical problems that may or may not arise. This perspective suggests a preference for practical solutions over precautionary measures that might constrain system performance or flexibility without concrete justification.</summary>
