    <summary>The discussion revolves around the potential enhancement of a current proposal through the integration of a tapscript-only `OP_CHECKTEMPLATE`. This suggestion is posited as a reasonable addition, particularly due to its benefits for the Lightning network and possibly other cases. The key advantage highlighted is the reduction in transaction size, quantified as a saving of approximately 8 weight units (WU), which originally might have been mistakenly referred to as 32 virtual bytes (vbytes). This improvement in efficiency could present meaningful optimizations for transaction processing and resource utilization within the network.</summary>
