    <summary>In the discussion about the potential implementation of a taproot-only push opcode, the idea of introducing a new witness version specifically for bare tapscript is proposed. This approach would allow for the continued support of bare CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) commitments while categorizing other types of bare scripts as non-standard. The introduction of a distinct witness version for bare tapscript could facilitate a more organized and efficient way to implement and manage these scripts within the system. This method suggests a tailored solution that addresses specific needs without broadly affecting the treatment of all script types, thereby maintaining a level of flexibility and specificity in script handling and execution.</summary>
