    <summary>The discussion focuses on the precision required for user experience in payment systems. It is argued that a 1ms precision level is not necessary for enhancing the payment user experience. Instead, it is suggested that a 100ms precision per hop would suffice for these purposes. This perspective highlights a balance between system performance and practical usability requirements, suggesting that overly precise measurements may not offer additional benefits to users or the overall transaction process. By advocating for a 100ms precision per hop, the argument implies a more pragmatic approach to system design, one that prioritizes efficiency and user satisfaction without overemphasizing technical specifications that may not yield perceivable improvements in user experience.</summary>
