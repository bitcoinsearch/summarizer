    <summary>Libbitcoin's approach to handling received transactions raises significant concerns regarding its vulnerability to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, the fact that libbitcoin does not delete any received transactions ever can lead to serious security and operational issues. Such a policy not only exposes the system to potential bandwidth waste but also escalates the risk to disk space being filled up maliciously. This problem is exacerbated when the system is out of sync with miners' policies or when an adversary manages to partition miners' mempools with pins, essentially allowing attackers to consume disk space at no cost to them.

Moreover, this policy implies that the required disk space for storing these transactions is only limited by the rate at which gossip protocols limit messaging traffic. Consequently, without effective mechanisms to mitigate these risks, libbitcoin users could find themselves frequently dealing with unnecessary data storage overheads and potentially serious disruptions. This situation highlights the importance of implementing robust data management and security measures to prevent such vulnerabilities from being exploited.</summary>
