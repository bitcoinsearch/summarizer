    <summary>The updated graph provided showcases the share of block reconstructions that did not require transaction requests, indicating that a higher percentage represents better efficiency. The visual data suggests an observable trend where increases in the mempool size, specifically when it exceeds 3 sat/vByte, correlate with a heightened necessity to request transactions for block reconstructions. This pattern is particularly evident during the periods of November 8 to November 15 and December 4 to December 17 of the year 2024, as highlighted by the examples given. These intervals demonstrate significant activities or events that lead to larger mempool sizes, subsequently impacting the efficiency of block reconstructions by increasing the dependency on transaction requests.</summary>
