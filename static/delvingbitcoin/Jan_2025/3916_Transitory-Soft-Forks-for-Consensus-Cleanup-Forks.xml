    <summary>Over the past three years, there has been contemplation regarding the transitory proposal concerning CTV (Check Template Verify) and similar proposals. A key concern raised revolves around the necessity of CTV if alternative methods for implementing covenants are developed. This issue, however, may be mitigated by the ongoing shift towards adopting the TXHASH approach, coupled with plans for future upgrades to CTV. This reflects a broader debate within the community on the evolution of blockchain technology and the search for optimal solutions to enhance its functionality and security.</summary>
