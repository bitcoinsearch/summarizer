    <summary>The discussion around the feasibility of an opcode that becomes non-functional after a certain period raises concerns about its applicability to long-term financial commitments, such as vaults, compared to short-term scenarios like lightning channels where a three-year operational window might be considered reasonable. This skepticism is rooted in the premise that users may hesitate to engage significant funds with something that has a built-in obsolescence, unlike more permanent solutions currently favored.

The conversation further evolves to address the inherent risks associated with the introduction of new Bitcoin-related products. It is noted that the cryptocurrency space sees the launch of numerous products annually, each vying for user adoption to sustain development. However, a significant portion of these products fails to secure enough interest, leading to their discontinuation. This cycle of innovation and obsolescence is not unique to Bitcoin or technology but is a common occurrence across various innovative industries. The mention of existing security-focused products like Casa, Unchained, and Liana underscores the reality that users must anticipate and plan for the potential discontinuation or failure of parts of these services. These circumstances necessitate the movement of funds to secure them against loss, highlighting the precarious nature of relying on digital financial products over extended periods.

The concept of a transitory soft fork is introduced as a counterargument to concerns about long-term reliability. Unlike traditional products that may become unsupported or fail, a soft fork designed to be temporary is posited as unlikely to suffer from premature obsolescence. This argument suggests a reassessment of how permanence is valued in the context of Bitcoin's evolving infrastructure, emphasizing the need for flexibility and adaptability in securing digital assets. The dialogue encapsulates the broader challenges facing the development and maintenance of Bitcoin-related services, reflecting on both the opportunities and vulnerabilities inherent to this dynamic sector.
