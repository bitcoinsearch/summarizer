    <summary>The discussion raises concerns regarding the reliability of ASIC firmware in acknowledging timestamps within its stratum job, suggesting that it is improbable for such firmware to disregard provided timestamps. This skepticism is rooted in personal experiences with older Linux machines, where Network Time Protocol (NTP) does not always function seamlessly upon initial setup. The implication here is that any significant bug related to timestamp recognition would likely have been discovered promptly due to the immediate and noticeable impact on functionality.

Furthermore, the text touches upon the broader implications of widespread NTP usage, particularly highlighting how its systemic implementation could potentially undermine security. This suggests a need for caution and perhaps a reevaluation of how NTP is integrated and relied upon within various systems, especially in contexts where precise timekeeping is crucial for security and operational integrity.</summary>
