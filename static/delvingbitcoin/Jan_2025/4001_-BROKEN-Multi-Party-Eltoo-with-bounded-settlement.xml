    <summary>The discussion raises an intriguing point about the effectiveness and feasibility of an attacker successfully hiding transactions from a specific victim, highlighting the complexity involved in such endeavors. The mention of a watchtower as a deterrent underscores the difficulty attackers face in keeping their actions concealed, suggesting that the mere threat of detection could significantly reduce the likelihood of successful deceit. This introduces a game-theoretic perspective, where the discovery of a hidden transaction before it is mined allows the victim to counteract promptly within the same block, thereby necessitating additional resources from the attacker to continue their ploy. Such dynamics underscore the intricate balance between the costs and benefits of implementing mechanisms to penalize or prevent deceptive actions, hinting at a nuanced evaluation of whether the added effort to enforce penalties or compel particular sequences of actions is justified by the potential advantages.</summary>
