    <summary>The discussion centers around the concept of "bikeshedding" in relation to extensions to CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), highlighting it as a focal point of contention and debate within the community. This term, borrowed from Parkinson's Law of Triviality, suggests that there is an excessive focus on minor details (in this case, extensions to CTV) at the expense of more significant issues. The use of "lowest common denominator" implies that the discourse may be dominated by the simplest or least sophisticated aspects of the technology, rather than engaging with more complex or impactful considerations. This phenomenon can hinder progress by diverting attention and resources away from more crucial developmental aspects of the technology.</summary>
