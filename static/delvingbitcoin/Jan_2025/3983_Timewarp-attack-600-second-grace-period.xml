    <summary>The email elaborates on the limitations and mechanisms of block production rate adjustment within a blockchain system. It clarifies that no existing theory supports the possibility of enhancing the rate at which blocks are produced. The intricacies of how difficulty adjustment works in response to changes in the network's hashrate are detailed, emphasizing that a decrease in difficulty is contingent upon a corresponding drop in hashrate. Specifically, the system is designed so that the difficulty level cannot decrease by more than 1.2% during a single adjustment period. This constraint is operational only if the reverse limit is set to 7200 and an attacker manipulates the timestamp of the last block to this future point.

Furthermore, the communication points out a critical aspect of the difficulty adjustment algorithm. It underscores that there cannot be an average decrease in difficulty over time since such a change would inadvertently lead to an increase in difficulty in the subsequent adjustment round. This mechanism ensures the stability and security of the blockchain against potential manipulation attempts.</summary>
