    <summary>The discussion highlights the importance of having a robust mining and relay policy in place as a metric for evaluating system performance, albeit acknowledging its vulnerability to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by malicious entities aiming to mine anomalous transactions. It points out that while certain features like CTV (Check Template Verify) or CAT (Covenants and Transactions) can be replicated through the use of signers, more complex operations such as block level introspections—which involve transaction sponsors or must-use outputs—are beyond the capabilities of signing federations.

Furthermore, the conversation casts doubt on the practicality of introducing opcodes that lose functionality after a set period. Such mechanisms, it is argued, might not entice users to commit significant amounts of funds, although they could be deemed suitable for specific applications like lightning channels that typically anticipate closure within a three-year timeframe. This skepticism extends to their use in more permanent structures like vaults, suggesting a limited appeal due to the inherent temporal limitations.</summary>
