    <summary>In the process of addressing the issue of duplicate coinbase transactions, a consensus has emerged around a novel solution: the implementation of a requirement for all coinbase transactions to have their `nLockTime` field set to the height of the previous block. This approach has been favored after extensive consultations with miners, who indicated their flexibility and acceptance towards either of the proposed fixes under discussion. The significant benefit of this method over others lies in its ability to facilitate the retrieval of the coinbase's block height without necessitating the parsing of Script. This feature not only simplifies the process but also enhances efficiency by streamlining access to critical transaction information. The openness to feedback indicates a collaborative effort in the decision-making process. Should there be any objections or compelling arguments for an alternative solution, stakeholders are encouraged to voice their opinions, ensuring that the chosen strategy is both effective and broadly supported within the community.</summary>
