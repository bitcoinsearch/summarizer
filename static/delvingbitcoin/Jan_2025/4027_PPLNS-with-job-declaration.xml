    <summary>Implementing the functionality of committing the share_index and then returning it to the miner presents significant challenges in terms of both correctness and efficiency. The primary justification for this feature is to prevent pools from providing false information about share indexes within a slice during challenges. However, this concern may be mitigated by the fact that the path itself suffices to determine the index of a leaf, a task for which the pool is already responsible for providing the necessary data. This suggests a potential redundancy in requiring the share_index to be committed and returned, given that the path information alone accomplishes the objective of index verification without the need for additional mechanisms.</summary>
