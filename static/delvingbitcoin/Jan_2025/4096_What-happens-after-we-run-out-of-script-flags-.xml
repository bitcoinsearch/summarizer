    <summary>In the process of evaluating a potential change within a codebase, it's been determined that altering the type as previously considered may not be a practical approach. This conclusion arises from the observation that such a modification introduces significant changes, undermining the simplicity and portability of the code. Despite the fact that the code compiles without errors, there's an implicit acknowledgment of underlying bugs that are not immediately apparent. 

A suggestion has been made to improve readability and clarity in the code by renaming `flags_t` to `ScriptFlags` or a similarly descriptive identifier. This naming convention would likely enhance the understanding of the code's purpose and functionality for future developers.
