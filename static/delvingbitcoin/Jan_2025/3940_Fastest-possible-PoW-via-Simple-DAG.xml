    <summary>The Nb/Nc Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) demonstrates resilience against variations in latency topology, effectively maintaining network consensus even when a minority of miners experience significantly higher latencies. Specifically, the algorithm's stability is not compromised by up to 5% of miners facing latency that is up to 20 times higher than average. This robust performance is attributed to the DAA's method of referencing a broader spectrum of blocksâ€”extending beyond immediate parents to include grandparents and great-grandparents within its scope of consideration. Such an approach ensures that the difficulty level remains appropriately high, aligning closely with the optimal Nb/Nc ratio of 2.42 per block for parents, as opposed to the 1.44/block ratio seen with parent-only referencing methods.

Despite the introduction of higher latency among a small fraction of miners, the grandparent method's impact on the difficulty adjustment does not significantly diverge from that observed with the parent method. This observation underscores the limited influence of a 5% hashrate contribution operating under elevated latency conditions on the overall difficulty adjustment mechanism. The maintained difficulty level, as illustrated in the referenced chart, highlights the algorithm's capacity to sustain a near-ideal difficulty setting across varying network conditions, thereby ensuring consistent block generation times and reinforcing the network's consensus mechanism.</summary>
