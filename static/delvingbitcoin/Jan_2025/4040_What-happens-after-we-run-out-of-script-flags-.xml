    <summary>The discussion revolves around the impact of a proposed change, emphasizing that it is not expected to disrupt other projects since it is confined to the core. The change involves adjusting a type, which is considered manageable. Currently, the project identified as LNHANCE utilizes only three flag bits. However, due to a preference for C3PO among many, there is an exploration of options for enabling concurrent overlapping activations. This exploration suggests a potential shift or expansion in the project's functionality to accommodate broader use cases or improve its operational flexibility.</summary>
