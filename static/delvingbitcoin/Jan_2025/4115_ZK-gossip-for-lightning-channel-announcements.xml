    <summary>Utreexo stands out for its determinism and ease of maintenance as a full-node, thanks to efficient updates to the accumulator. This system requires the use of an accumulator for both the creation and verification of proofs, offering an efficiency advantage over the approach of generating a new UTXO snapshot every six hours. The discussion around integrating a suitable proof scheme into lightning consensus has been challenging, with no viable solution identified in past discussions. This has been identified as a significant obstacle. An alternative method proposed involves dividing the UTXO snapshot into separate trees based on different amount ranges, allowing for proofs against a single amount range. This method suggests a potential pathway to circumvent the challenges associated with finding a suitable proof scheme for integration into lightning consensus.</summary>
