    <summary>The email addresses an inconsistency which arose from a confusion during the data compilation process, specifically distinguishing between the minimum block weight and the minimum coinbase weight. The sender clarifies having updated the coinbase chart after segregating coinbase weight statistics from block weight metrics. This action suggests a meticulous approach to data accuracy and presentation.

Furthermore, there's an indication that F2Pool might be utilizing a version of Bitcoin Core that includes modifications from a specific GitHub pull request ([https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31384issuecomment-2593329870](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31384issuecomment-2593329870)). This assertion implies a need for thorough review and verification of the data to confirm the utilization of the patch, highlighting the importance of cross-referencing and validation in ensuring the reliability of the information presented.</summary>
