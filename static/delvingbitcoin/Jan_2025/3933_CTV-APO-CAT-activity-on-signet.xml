    <summary>Promoting rationales considered unfavorable can lead to unintended consequences, especially in environments such as permissionless wiki pages, which are inherently vulnerable to sybil attacks. These attacks involve the creation of multiple fake identities for malicious purposes, undermining the integrity of content and discussions. In such contexts, it is crucial to focus on enhancing whatever valuable information (signals) exists rather than contributing to or amplifying the disruptive elements (noise). This approach not only helps in maintaining the quality and reliability of the information but also in safeguarding the platform against manipulative practices that could compromise its usefulness and credibility.</summary>
