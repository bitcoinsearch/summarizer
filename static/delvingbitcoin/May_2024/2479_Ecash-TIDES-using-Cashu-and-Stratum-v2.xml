    <summary>Cryptographic attestation is proposed as a means to enhance the transparency of share logs in mining pools, providing an additional layer of verification that miners can utilize. This concept revolves around allowing any participant within a pool to comprehensively audit the payouts being made by the pool. In the event of discrepancies or dishonest practices by the pool, users have the ability to publish a concise proof highlighting the issue at hand. The simplicity of this protocol is emphasized, noting its minimal overhead as a significant advantage. However, it's acknowledged that there exists a time lag in the auditing process, which is countered by the argument that mining pools inherently experience delays before executing payouts. This delay is deemed inconsequential, suggesting that the benefits of cryptographic attestation in maintaining transparent and verifiable share logs outweigh the potential drawbacks associated with timing.</summary>
