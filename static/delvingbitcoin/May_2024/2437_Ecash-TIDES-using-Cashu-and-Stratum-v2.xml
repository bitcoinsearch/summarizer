    <summary>The TIDES documentation provides clarity on how shares are weighted, specifically mentioning the role of the `share_log_window` in this process. It outlines that a blinded signature, which is matched with a target difficulty, is used as a method for valuation within the `share_log_window`. This implies that an `eShare` does not equate directly to satoshis, suggesting a nuanced approach to valuation that diverges from a straightforward 1:1 conversion rate.

An interesting alternative was considered, where the mint could determine the value of blind signatures retrospectively, meaning that the user wouldn't need to assign a value when sending the blind message. However, this option was ultimately set aside in favor of a simpler, more direct approach that does not require the mint operator to keep track of all outstanding blind messages for later valuation. This decision reflects a preference for simplicity and efficiency in the system's design, avoiding the complexities associated with post-transaction value assignment. The exchange on GitHub highlighted an original idea that was reconsidered in light of these practical considerations, leading to the adoption of the current methodology.</summary>
