    <summary>The primary focus of the discussed proposal is to introduce privacy into payout processes. The complexity of the proposal does not lie in the aspect of quick payments but rather in the mechanism for migration when a pool fails to pay out sufficiently. This addresses a significant concern within the system, aiming to enhance the security and privacy of transactions. Despite this core aim, much of the ongoing discussion appears to deviate towards topics that are either unrelated or only marginally connected to the main issue at hand. The emphasis on privacy for payouts marks a critical step towards improving the overall functionality and trustworthiness of the system, suggesting that more attention should be directed towards directly relevant matters to fully realize its potential benefits.</summary>
