    <summary>Hosted channels are recognized as custodial entities, which may present a simplistic view to those not deeply immersed in the nuances of stabilizing the purchasing power of sats. This observation highlights an underappreciated complexity within the digital currency ecosystem, particularly concerning the use of fiat channels. Fiat channels operate by relying on independent oracles to establish consensus on pricing. However, this reliance introduces a significant risk factor, as discrepancies or disagreements among these oracles can precipitate the forced closure of actual transaction channels. This situation underscores the multifaceted challenges faced when attempting to ensure stable value exchange in the realm of digital currencies, pointing towards the intricate balance required between technical solutions and financial stability mechanisms.</summary>
