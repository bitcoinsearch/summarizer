    <summary>Cryptographic attestation refers to the process where a pool or mint authenticates individual shares by signing them, ensuring their integrity and authenticity. This method allows for immediate verification that any alterations made after the fact are unauthorized, thereby safeguarding against malicious tampering. The discussion suggests that this form of attestation could be seamlessly integrated into existing protocols, such as Sv2, by enabling pools to sign all successful share submissions without complicating the system with unnecessary extensions.

The primary aim of the proposal in question appears to be the enhancement of privacy concerning payout processes. It emphasizes the need for discretion without fundamentally altering the underlying mechanisms of transaction or share validation. The critique points out that the proposal may be overly intricate given its straightforward objective. To achieve the desired level of privacy for payouts, the suggestion is to utilize lightning or ecash for transactions. This approach would negate the need for directly associating shares with ecash or engaging in complex modifications, thus streamlining the process.</summary>
