    <summary>In discussing the critique of blockchain technology, it's acknowledged that there doesn't seem to be a technical solution available to address the concerns raised. However, the varied legal responsibilities held by miners across different jurisdictions might offer some hope. There's an optimistic view that despite these challenges, there could be miners willing to process every transaction, ensuring none are left unattended. This perspective suggests a reliance on the diverse global landscape of blockchain operation and compliance with local laws as a potential pathway to mitigate issues within the blockchain infrastructure.</summary>
