    <summary>The discussion highlights the potential economic impact of a blockchain reorganization, commonly referred to as a reorg, that extends beyond six blocks in depth. It suggests that the consequences of such an extensive reorg could be more detrimental than those arising from a block that requires an hour for validation. This point underscores the significance of work parity among competing blocks in the validation process. In essence, only blocks that encapsulate the same amount of computational work, or those within a fork characterized by equivalent work metrics, are deemed capable of engaging in a legitimate competition for validation. The rarity of this scenario is acknowledged, casting doubt on the practical utility of any feature designed to exploit this competitive mechanism. The implication here is twofold: firstly, it questions the viability of leveraging block validation races as a means to enhance network performance or security; secondly, it raises concerns about the overall frequency and impact of such events within the blockchain ecosystem, suggesting that their occurrence may be too infrequent to justify the development of specialized features aimed at managing them.</summary>
