    <summary>Radpool introduces a novel framework aimed at decentralizing the block template generation process, which is conventionally centralized within mining pools. This initiative seeks to mitigate the centralization of mining operations by establishing an open syndicate of nodes known as Mining Service Providers (MSPs). By enabling MSPs to independently construct block templates and operate stratum servers, Radpool empowers miners with the flexibility to build their own templates, thereby fostering a decentralized structure. The use of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) community implementations within Radpool's node implementation offers MSPs a variety of options, supporting the platform's commitment to decentralization.

The payout mechanism implemented by Radpool leverages Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) to provide miners with compensation based on their hash rate at predetermined intervals. This system ensures that MSPs, who fund these contracts, can settle them using FROST threshold signatures. Additionally, MSPs earn returns from the coinbase transactions of pooled blocks through a Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) scheme. This model reduces the risk associated with the variance in block discovery and guarantees miner payouts by preventing unilateral withdrawals by MSPs. Such a setup promotes stability and reliability within the Radpool ecosystem, offering a compelling proposition for entities capable of funding DLC contracts to operate as MSPs and earn yields by attracting miners.

Radpool's design strategically positions it between centralized pools and peer-to-peer (p2p) pools, creating a hybrid model that combines the benefits of decentralization with the efficiency of centralized pools. This approach aims to reduce variance for miners and increase yield opportunities for MSPs, thereby encouraging a competitive market for pool fees and fostering network growth through a classic network effect. Key features of Radpool include the decentralized construction of block templates, payment to miners via futures contracts built on DLCs, and the use of Radpool as an oracle for attestation generation by MSPs. Transparent share accounting and the facilitation of unilateral exits for both miners and MSPs are also integral to Radpool's innovation, making the transition seamless for miners accustomed to centralized pools.

Development efforts are currently focused on the FROST Federation, which underpins the federation of MSPs, along with the early stages of implementing DLC contracts using Rust-DLC. The community is encouraged to engage in discussions on Discord to explore potential vulnerabilities and contribute to the project's ongoing development.</summary>
