    <summary>The matter of consensus on share distribution is critical for ensuring that payments are made appropriately. Without a unified agreement on the ownership and division of shares, it becomes impossible to execute payments in a decentralized manner. This necessity paves the way for the development of a consensus mechanism specifically designed to manage the accounting of shares accurately.

In addressing this need, the Braid mechanism emerges as a notable solution. Currently, there is an ongoing project to port this mechanism to Rust, highlighting its significance and utility in this domain. The Braid mechanism operates fundamentally on the principles of Nakamoto consensus but applies it within the structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This approach suggests that while the concept of achieving consensus on a DAG is straightforward, executing it correctly requires adherence to established methodologies without much room for variation.</summary>
