    <summary>The [Great Consensus Cleanup](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710) proposal is an initiative aimed at addressing the issue of worst-case block validation times through a consensus change in the Bitcoin network. The challenge lies in the potential for blocks that are time-consuming to validate, which could be exploited or occur accidentally, posing risks to network integrity and efficiency. Traditional methods of dealing with these issues, such as SegWit and Taproot, have provided some relief by making it easier to manage block validation concerns. Furthermore, innovative approaches like Simplicity are fully accounting for these considerations, suggesting a shift towards more sustainable solutions.

One novel idea proposed to mitigate the risk of slow blocks is parallel block validation. This approach allows nodes to validate competing blocks simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The objective is to preferentially propagate faster-to-validate blocks when they are in direct competition with slower ones, thus increasing the stale risk for the latter. However, implementing pure parallel validation poses significant technical challenges. A proposed workaround involves a node continuing to listen for announcements of competing blocks while validating another. If a competing block appears that potentially validates quicker, the node would switch its validation efforts to the new block. An additional heuristic could involve aborting the validation of a block if its validation time exceeds the average by more than five standard deviations, assuming a competing block has been announced.

Despite the appeal of these strategies, several concerns arise. Implementing such mechanisms in Bitcoin Core is complex and could leave existing nodes without parallel validation capabilities at a disadvantage. Moreover, the effectiveness of these strategies in mitigating malicious attacks remains uncertain, given the various ways attackers could exploit block validation times. For instance, attackers might craft transactions in non-SegWit blocks that are particularly costly to validate, creating a potential advantage for miners with higher-end hardware or those willing to bypass validation rules among trusted peers. Additionally, there's speculation on whether such measures could inadvertently encourage the mining of empty blocks or if the safeguards, like the proposed five-sigma threshold, are sufficient to prevent misuse.

The discussion also touches on the dynamic between block size, validation times, and propagation advantages. While compact blocks have addressed some of the disadvantages smaller blocks faced due to transmission times, the issue of validation speed remains a more significant bottleneck, potentially impacting network performance far more than bandwidth limitations. This complex interplay of factors underscores the need for a careful analysis of proposed solutions and their implications for the broader Bitcoin network.</summary>
