    <summary>The discussion revolves around the efficiency and performance of Libbitcoin in terms of syncing time with the blockchain. The benchmarks previously published highlight the performance on a network connection of 2.3Gbps download and 40Mbps upload speeds. Under these conditions, downloading to block 850k would not be feasible within 20 minutes, as initially questioned. The theoretical limit, considering the given network parameters, stands at approximately 40 minutes, though practical experiences suggest a closer approximation to 60 minutes for completing this task. It is speculated that an enhanced network speed, specifically a 5Gbps connection, could potentially reduce the synchronization time to around 30 minutes, indicating a significant improvement in performance with higher bandwidth availability. This information suggests that while Libbitcoin's performance is notably influenced by the quality of the internet connection, achieving optimal sync times requires substantially faster networks than what was initially tested.</summary>
