    <title>A Fast, Scalable Protocol For Resolving Lightning Payments</title>

    <summary>The explanation provided sheds light on the nature of a specific type of attack that is not associated with the usage of a burn output but can similarly impact the current lightning protocol. The distinction lies in the duration of a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which necessitates a longer timeframe under the existing protocol due to extended expiry times. This situation underscores an underlying tradeoff between the maximum payment resolution latency and the availability requirements of each node within the network. The balance point between these factors in practical scenarios remains uncertain.

Furthermore, the ability to negotiate this tradeoff without encountering the latency issues associated with onchain transactions, along with avoiding additional congestion on the blockchain for resolving Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), presents an intriguing prospect. This capability may offer a strategic advantage, suggesting a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in optimizing network performance while ensuring robust security measures against potential attacks.</summary>
