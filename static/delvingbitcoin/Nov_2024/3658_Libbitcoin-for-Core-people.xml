    <summary>Libbitcoin employs a sophisticated method for handling block input points by incorporating them into a hashmap. This process is crucial for verifying the uniqueness of each point during the addition phase, ensuring that no duplicates are entered. The technique leverages the efficiency of hashmaps to achieve constant time complexity for each input operation. This means that regardless of the size of the data or the number of inputs, the time taken to add a new input remains consistent and does not increase.

The verification and addition of block input points to the hashmap occur during the `block.check` phase. This phase is strategically positioned to coincide with the block download process. A significant advantage of this setup is that it allows for full concurrency during the download. By synchronizing the checking of block inputs with the downloading process, Libbitcoin optimizes the use of resources and time, enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. This approach not only streamlines the verification of block input points but also contributes to the rapid and secure processing of blocks within the Libbitcoin system.</summary>
