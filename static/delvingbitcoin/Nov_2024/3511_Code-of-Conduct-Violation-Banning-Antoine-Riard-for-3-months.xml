    <summary>The decision to remove Antoine Riard from the GitHub lightning organization was made after a period of ongoing harassment, in accordance with the Code of Conduct (CoC). The action extends to blocking his contributions to the repository for three months. This measure underscores a principle that while diversity and tolerance within the community are highly valued, individuals causing more harm than benefit will be directed to leave. Such decisions are deemed beneficial not just for the community but also for the individual involved, offering them an opportunity to engage in more constructive activities.

The founding principle of the initial Lightning IRC channel emphasized mutual respect and excellence towards one another, a standard that the community has proudly upheld. This recent action reaffirms the commitment to maintaining a positive and respectful environment for all members. Rusty and Vincenzo express their appreciation for the community's adherence to these values.</summary>
