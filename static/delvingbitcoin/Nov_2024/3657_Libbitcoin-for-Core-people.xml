    <summary>In the realm of software performance optimization, particularly within core architecture, strategic architectural adjustments can significantly enhance efficiency. One notable example involves a proposed change in the handling of transaction graph connection logic within Bitcoin's core system. The suggestion, detailed in a pull request ([#14837](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/14837)), advocates for separating this logic from the broader transaction processing workflow. This separation not only aims to streamline the current process but also sets the stage for future refinements. Specifically, it opens up opportunities to make script processing more efficient. Such proposals highlight the ongoing need and potential for revisiting and implementing refactors that target core architectural components to unlock improved performance.</summary>
