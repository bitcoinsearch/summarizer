    <summary>Libbitcoin significantly enhances the efficiency and functionality of indexing transactions compared to traditional methods. By always indexing all transactions along with all spenders, Libbitcoin provides a comprehensive relational storage of chain objects with full constant time bidirectional indexation. This approach not only facilitates a huge amount of information but also ensures faster query responses, markedly improving upon the performance observed with Core benchmarks, where transaction indexing (txindex) is typically disabled.

Moreover, Libbitcoin offers the option to incorporate a full Electrum style address index, similar to ElectrumX, with an additional synchronization time of merely 30 minutes. This is a stark contrast to the days it can take for ElectrumX to extract and index similar information from a local Core node. The efficiency extends to shutdown times as well; whereas Core might take upwards of 10 minutes to shut down, Libbitcoin nodes generally complete the process in less than a minute even following a full synchronization, highlighting its superior performance and reliability. This comparison does not even account for the significantly reduced shutdown time, which further underscores Libbitcoin's advantages.</summary>
