    <summary>The discussion revolves around the experimentation with replacement cycling using Warnet, highlighting prior efforts before a significant refactor was mentioned by Jonas. These experiments were primarily based on a replacement cycling example developed by Ariard, which can be explored in detail through the provided GitHub links ([Warnet Pull Request 422](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet/pull/422) and [Warnet Pull Request 373](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet/pull/373)). Furthermore, Jonas has indicated that the Warnet team is in the process of introducing a new system aimed at deploying lightning nodes into Warnet. Alongside this development, there's an initiative to implement a new plugin system. This system is being designed to simplify the process for users who wish to extend functionality, making it more user-friendly and accessible for enhancements and customizations.</summary>
