    <summary>Implementing a stronger measure to mitigate slow-block attacks poses a significant alteration in behavior during non-attack scenarios, notably making single confirmations considerably less secure. The challenge lies in effectively differentiating between an attack and a non-attack situation. If the script is intrinsically considered an attack, the proposal suggests a softer approach, like a soft fork, to eliminate it. This method aims at addressing the issue without drastically changing the normal operational behavior, ensuring that legitimate activities are not unduly impacted while still providing a solution to the identified problem.</summary>
