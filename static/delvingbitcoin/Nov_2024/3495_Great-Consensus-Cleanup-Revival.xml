    <summary>A neat solution proposed for enhancing the security and integrity of blockchain transactions involves modifying the `nLockTime` parameter within the coinbase transaction to match the height of the block that is currently being created. This modification aims to synchronize the transaction's validity with the specific block height, thereby ensuring that each coinbase transaction is uniquely tied to a particular block. To support this mechanism effectively, it becomes crucial to adjust the `nSequence` field of the coinbase input to `SEQUENCE_FINAL`. This adjustment is essential because without setting the `nSequence` to its final value, the coinbase transaction would not pass the `IsFinalTx()` validation. The validation process checks whether a transaction meets the criteria for being considered final and valid for inclusion in the next block. By mandating these changes, the proposal seeks to fortify the transaction process against potential issues by leveraging the locktime and sequence fields to enforce transaction integrity at a block level.</summary>
