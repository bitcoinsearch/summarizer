    <summary>The Warnet team has expressed their willingness to provide support, mentioning that they previously included Lightning Network (LN) support which was temporarily disabled due to a recent refactor. They anticipate achieving feature parity within two weeks. The conversation began with a positive note towards collaboration, and there is an interest in initiating discussions sooner to ensure the most effective use of the refactor. To facilitate this, a review of the [warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet) repository is planned, alongside a desire to engage directly with a team member for a deeper understanding of how to align the project's goals with the upcoming changes. This approach underscores the importance of communication in collaborative projects and the readiness to adapt and discuss strategies for mutual benefit.</summary>
