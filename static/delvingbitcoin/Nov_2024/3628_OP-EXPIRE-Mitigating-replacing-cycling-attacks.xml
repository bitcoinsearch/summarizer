    <summary>The topic revolves around a specific issue related to LN (Lightning Network) script-oriented problems and the lack of available Warnet for deploying LN. The discussion highlights that although there was previously support for LN within the [warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet) framework, it has been temporarily disabled due to recent restructuring efforts. However, there is a clear indication that the feature will be reintroduced, with expectations set for achieving feature parity within two weeks. The correspondence reflects an openness towards initiating conversations on this matter at the current moment, suggesting a collaborative approach towards resolving the identified challenges. The involvement of the warnet team is notably positive, as they express eagerness to support endeavors related to Lightning Network integration.</summary>
