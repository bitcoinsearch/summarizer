    <summary>Implementing post-processing after linearization offers significant benefits in programming, especially when dealing with data organization and manipulation. This technique ensures that sub-chunk linearization is effectively achieved. It is particularly useful at the end of a block where fitting a full chunk might not be possible. Instead of employing a comprehensive search or skipping clusters to locate ones with smaller chunks, this approach provides a streamlined solution.

Moreover, the efficiency of re-running post-processing on an already-post-processed linearization is noteworthy. The process operates in \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) time without necessitating swaps, which underscores its computational efficiency. This aspect is crucial for maintaining the integrity and order of clusters in their linearization format, as opposed to a chunked format.

The strategy of performing post-processing at the time of chunking and preserving the outcome merits attention. By adopting this method, one can ensure that the quality benefits of chunkings are always leveraged. Additionally, this approach guarantees that re-chunkings, when they are sufficiently trivial, remain linear in terms of time complexity. This dual advantage highlights the practicality and effectiveness of incorporating post-processing early in the workflow, thereby enhancing the overall structure and accessibility of the data.</summary>
