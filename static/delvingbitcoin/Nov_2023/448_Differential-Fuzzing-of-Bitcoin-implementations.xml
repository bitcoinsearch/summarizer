    <summary>The focus of the recent project is on differential fuzzing, specifically targeting Bitcoin implementations and libraries. The work is currently centered around miniscript, with both Core's and rust-miniscript being subjected to this fuzzing process. The initiative aims to gather ideas and feedback from the community to enhance the effectiveness of the fuzzing strategy. The project can be accessed and reviewed on GitHub at [bitcoinfuzz](https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoinfuzz). This endeavor is an open invitation for contributions and discussions that could lead to improvements in the security and reliability of Bitcoin's underlying technology.</summary>
