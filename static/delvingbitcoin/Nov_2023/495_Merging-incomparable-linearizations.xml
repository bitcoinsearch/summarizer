    <summary>In the discussion, the focus is on considering $C$ as an operation applied to a list of chunks. These chunks are characterized by their generalized feerates, which do not necessarily follow a monotonically decreasing order. The primary objective is to establish a proof that demonstrates $C(\epsilon_n + \delta_n) \geq \gamma_n$. This involves a strategic placement of $C()$ invocations within the derivation process, adhering closely to the predefined rules governing these operations. The approach suggests an adaptation of the existing derivation, highlighting the necessity of careful application and manipulation of $C()$ to achieve the desired outcome. This method emphasizes not only the mathematical rigor required but also the nuanced understanding of how $C$ operates within this context, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical formulation and practical application.</summary>
