    <summary>The discussion centers on the importance of consensus checks in programming, specifically in the context of ensuring that standardness checks do not permit any exceptions that consensus does not. This process is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of programming standards. The consensus checks serve two primary purposes: they are instrumental in priming the script/validation cache and guaranteeing that there are no discrepancies between what is considered standard and what is agreed upon by consensus.

It's also highlighted that this procedure is not a new practice but one that is currently employed in the programming community. This reaffirms the ongoing relevance and necessity of these checks in upholding programming protocols and standards. The emphasis on consensus checks underscores their role in preemptively identifying and mitigating potential issues that could arise from inconsistencies between standardness checks and consensus agreements.</summary>
