    <summary>BIP141, also known as Segregated Witness (SegWit), specifies a requirement for pushing between 2 and 40 bytes. This specification is crucial for understanding the technical underpinnings of SegWit's approach to scaling and improving Bitcoin. The question raised about the limitation against a 1-byte push highlights an inquiry into the design decisions embedded within BIP141. These design choices are pivotal in ensuring the efficiency, security, and overall functionality of the protocol. The discussion around byte pushing in BIP141 touches on fundamental aspects of Bitcoin's scalability solutions, where each technical requirement, such as the specified byte push range, serves specific purposes in optimizing transaction processing and block size issues.</summary>
