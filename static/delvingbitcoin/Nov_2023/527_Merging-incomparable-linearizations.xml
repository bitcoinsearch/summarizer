    <summary>The discussion revolves around the nuances of a mathematical proof in which the inclusion of case $\gamma_0 + \zeta_0$ is debated. The contention lies in whether or not it is necessary to explicitly mention this case within the proof, considering that if all subsequent points lie above a certain diagram, it would seem intuitive that the line from the origin to the first point would as well. The requirement hinges on the level of clarity needed before omitting what could be perceived as an obvious element.

Furthermore, the method of comparing two diagrams by assessing whether all points on one are below all the points on the other has been brought into question. It was initially suggested that this approach might not be viable, with the possibility raised that a graph could exist above another graph at every point without having higher derivatives (feerates). However, this critique was reevaluated upon realizing that the comparison pertains to the average feerate for the entire setup up to a certain point, rather than the feerate of an individual chunk or section. This insight leads to the understanding that having a higher fee diagram essentially implies a higher average feerate.</summary>
