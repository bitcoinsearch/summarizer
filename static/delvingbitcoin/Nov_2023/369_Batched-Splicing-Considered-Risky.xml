    <summary>The email highlights the possibility of having multiple splice transactions in-flight within a network, suggesting that managing these transactions is feasible by adjusting certain parameters. Specifically, it mentions the strategy of removing an offending channel from a batch as a viable solution to potential issues, provided there is a willingness to increase the feerate. This approach implies a level of flexibility in handling transactions but also underscores the necessity for a batched splicing implementation to actively monitor for such scenarios. The discussion points towards a technical consideration in the management of splice transactions, emphasizing the balance between operational flexibility and the need for vigilant monitoring to ensure smooth transaction flows.</summary>
