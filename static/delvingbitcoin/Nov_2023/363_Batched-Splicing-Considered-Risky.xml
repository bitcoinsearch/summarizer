    <summary>The necessity for a `splice_cancelled` feature within the splice protocol is highlighted due to the current lack of options when a splice transaction fails to confirm. This feature would provide a means to retract from a splice without having to resort to unilateral closure of channels. The concern stems from the risky nature of batched splices involving multiple participants. In such scenarios, the failure of one participant's transaction to confirm could lead to the unilateral closing of all other involved channels. This scenario underscores the importance of developing mechanisms for safe withdrawal from failed splice transactions, thereby mitigating the risks associated with batched splice operations. The discussion points towards an area in the splice protocol that requires further development to enhance reliability and safety for users engaging in complex transactions involving multiple parties.</summary>
