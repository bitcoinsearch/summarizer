    <summary>The correspondence highlights an issue encountered during programming, specifically with the `OP_ROLL` operation. The problem arises when attempting to use `OP_ROLL` in a context where the operand isn't static, leading to an error. This situation is described as both understandable and disappointing by the programmer, suggesting a mix of acceptance of technical limitations and a wish for more flexibility or capability within the programming environment.</summary>
