    <summary>John Law's tunable penalties protocol offers a significant advantage in dealing with the assignment of penalties among multiple parties, similar to the benefits provided by LN-Symmetry, but does so without necessitating any changes to consensus. However, its complexity is seen as a major barrier to implementation, unlike the more straightforward ln-sym. There's curiosity around whether modifications akin to APO or other covenant alterations could simplify the system to a level comparable to Daric, while still facilitating multiparty penalties. Despite the critique on the excessive focus on penalties within the system, it's acknowledged that since penalties were one of the first features implemented, altering this aspect would incur costs.</summary>
