    <summary>Implementing a system where two instances run simultaneously, one for importing and the other for displaying data, is indeed feasible. This approach eliminates the need for switching between tasks, as one instance could continuously clone from GitHub. Upon completion, the second instance can perform a GitLab to GitLab clone, which is significantly faster since it primarily involves database dumping without relying on APIs. Such a setup would streamline the process for viewers by providing them with a single URL to access the data.

However, there's an underlying question regarding the actual necessity of making the data viewable before it's required. The anticipation of a significant interest in accessing the data beforehand might not align with reality. Despite this, ensuring the integrity and cleanliness of the backup data is crucial. Regular checks to confirm the backup's functionality and the absence of corrupt data are essential. These verifications could potentially be automated through scripting, adding an additional layer of efficiency and reliability to the system.</summary>
