    <summary>The discourse introduces the concept of property-based testing, specifically in the realm of 64-bit arithmetic operations within a programming context. The simplicity of arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction (`OP_ADD`, `OP_SUB`) is highlighted as an ideal starting point for those interested in applying property-based testing methods. This approach is suggested without necessitating speculation on the activation of a soft fork, thereby providing a straightforward option for testing existing opcodes. The emphasis is on the practicality and accessibility of beginning with basic arithmetic functions to explore the benefits and applications of property-based testing in programming.</summary>
