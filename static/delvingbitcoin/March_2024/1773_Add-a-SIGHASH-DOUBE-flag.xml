    <summary>The principal concern raised involves the limitations in flexibility and expressiveness when comparing certain technologies to TXHASH, highlighting a notable disparity. An additional issue is the necessity for a new script version whenever there's a need to define fresh flags. This situation prompts a reconsideration of alternatives like SIGHASH_BUNDLE and APO/AS, especially under circumstances where TXHASH might not be an option. 

The discussion further suggests the potential for improvement in the context of a hypothetical "Taproot 2.0" iteration. This would aim to address and rectify major shortcomings identified in Taproot's initial implementation. Within this scenario, the incorporation of new sighash modes within that updated script version emerges as a worthy consideration. The conversation implies that such enhancements could significantly bolster the system's overall functionality and user experience.</summary>
