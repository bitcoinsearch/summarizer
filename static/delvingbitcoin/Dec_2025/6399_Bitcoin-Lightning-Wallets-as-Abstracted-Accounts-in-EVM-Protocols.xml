    <title>Bitcoin Lightning Wallets as Abstracted Accounts in EVM Protocols</title>

    <summary>The recent initiative by SatsBridge introduces a pioneering protocol that integrates Bitcoin's Lightning Network (LN) with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, focusing on enhancing user experience and security in cross-chain wallet architecture. This protocol utilizes LNURL AUTH to extend its application towards managing Ethereum abstracted accounts, thus enabling Lightning wallets to serve as remote signers for these accounts without necessitating any modifications to the existing Lightning wallets. The essence of this integration lies in leveraging the cryptographic compatibility between Bitcoin’s secp256k1 signatures and Ethereum's signing schemes, underpinned by the privacy and security features inherent in LNURL AUTH. This synergy allows for a seamless bridge between Bitcoin users and the DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum, maintaining their preferred security models while accessing a wider range of services.

A notable implementation of this protocol was demonstrated during the Unite DeFi hackathon, showcasing the potential of LNURL with Safe Protocol vaults and 1inch libraries to create secure and configurable multi-signature vaults. These vaults capitalize on the QR-code-driven user experience of the Lightning Network and the programmable flexibility of Ethereum smart contracts, thereby creating a three-layer architecture where authentication keys generated by Lightning wallets can own Safe multisignature vaults. This structure ensures that all keys, derived from the main seed phrase, are closely integrated yet distinct across Bitcoin L1, L2, and LNURL AUTH levels.

The operation of this protocol involves a sequence of interactions starting from user registration via LNURL AUTH to the final creation of a Safe vault on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. This procedure encapsulates key steps such as session initialization, authentication, account abstraction preparation, Safe account configuration, and transaction execution, culminating in the establishment of a new vault. The protocol benefits from Ethereum's ERC-4337 standard for gas abstraction, eliminating the need for Lightning users to possess ETH for transaction fees, thereby lowering barriers to entry into the DeFi space.

Despite its innovative approach and the removal of certain barriers to DeFi adoption for Bitcoin users, the SatsBridge protocol acknowledges inherent risks associated with blind signing, a vulnerability exploited in significant hacks like the $1.5 billion Bybit incident. Lightning wallets' inability to fully interpret Ethereum transaction data poses a challenge in securely authorizing operations beyond simple token transfers. To mitigate these risks, SatsBridge proposes an open-source Web3 paired app that enhances situational awareness and interaction with the LNURL-AA protocol, promoting a 'trust but verify' attitude among users. Additionally, integrating Metamask as a co-signer could further bolster security by leveraging Ethereum's established standards for safe smart contract interactions.

This convergence of Bitcoin's Lightning Network and Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem through the SatsBridge protocol marks a significant step forward in cross-chain interoperability, aiming to foster a more accessible and secure DeFi landscape.
