    <summary>In response to the need for clearer documentation and in light of significant technical updates, Ethan Heilman, Isabel Foxen Duke, and Hunter Beast have thoroughly revised BIP 360. The revision was deemed necessary due to the introduction of substantial changes in previous updates that required a new approach to enhance the clarity of the proposal and effectively articulate strategies for mitigating quantum-related risks. The updated version of BIP 360 does not incorporate post-quantum signature schemes but introduces a new output type named &quot;Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH).&quot; This innovation is designed to omit the key path spend, thus protecting it from vulnerabilities in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that could be exploited by advancements in quantum computing or other cryptographic developments. This change aims to strengthen Bitcoin's defense mechanisms against potential threats to ECC, marking a vital progression in the cryptocurrency's journey towards quantum resistance.
The revised proposal also enriches its technical framework by including test vectors in Python and Rust, which are intended to facilitate a broader understanding and easier implementation of the proposed changes. The authors have invited the community to review these modifications through platforms such as the [BIP Repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1670) and [BIP360.org](http://bip360.org), highlighting their dedication to improving Bitcoin's security in collaboration with users, developers, and enthusiasts. This initiative underscores the significance of proactive measures in safeguarding against advancing cryptanalytic technologies.
Furthermore, the use of the term Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH) for a specific transaction type has raised concerns regarding future compatibility and clarity, particularly with the potential integration of Simplicity—a high-level programming language for smart contracts and blockchain applications. The evolution of blockchain technology necessitates a careful consideration of naming conventions to ensure they remain intuitive and accurately descriptive of their functions amidst growing complexity and diversity. The introduction of Simplicity and other advancements highlights the importance of adopting forward-looking and reflective terminologies that can accommodate future developments without leading to obsolescence or misinterpretation. This concern emphasizes the broader challenge of developing a lexicon for blockchain technology that evolves alongside the technology itself.
Additionally, there's a notable mention of enabling TXHASH, which would permit committing to a spending path requiring multi-step secret reveal, thus allowing transactions under adversarial quantum conditions without the need for signatures. This concept suggests that even in the face of quantum breakthroughs, it would be possible to securely vault and spend coins without an established signature scheme, as discussed on [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/a-quantum-resistance-script-only-using-op-ctv-op-txhash-and-no-new-signatures/2168). This idea contributes to the ongoing dialogue on enhancing Bitcoin's quantum resilience, further illustrating the dynamic nature of blockchain technology's development and the continuous search for innovative solutions to emerging challenges.</summary>
