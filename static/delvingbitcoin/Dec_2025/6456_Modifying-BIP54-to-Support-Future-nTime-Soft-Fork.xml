    <summary>The discourse on whether to undertake a hard fork in blockchain technology presents nuanced arguments, emphasizing the need for caution while acknowledging potential exceptions. The primary concern against hard forking is the risk it poses to users' access and ownership of their digital assets. This risk emerges from the possibility of software incompatibility post-fork, which could render users' coins inaccessible, effectively confiscating their assets without consent. Such a scenario underlines the importance of maintaining continuity and compatibility within the blockchain network to safeguard users' interests.

Moreover, the argument extends to the logistical challenges associated with forcing users to upgrade their software to remain compatible with the network. In contexts where deployment schedules span decades, the urgency and feasibility of enforcing mass upgrades diminish, suggesting that the negative impact of a hard fork might be overstated in such long-term perspectives. However, this does not entirely mitigate the concerns around user inconvenience and the broader implications for network integrity.

The discussion also touches upon the technical limitations imposed by opting for soft forks over hard forks. Soft forks limit the scope of changes that can be introduced to the network, potentially hindering significant improvements or corrections, such as adjustments to the total supply limit of the currency. Nonetheless, the suggestion to limit hard forks to infrequent occurrences (e.g., once or twice per century) aims to strike a balance between innovation and stability. This approach proposes a middle ground where the blockchain can evolve through substantial updates without frequent disruptions, thereby preserving user trust and system coherence.</summary>
