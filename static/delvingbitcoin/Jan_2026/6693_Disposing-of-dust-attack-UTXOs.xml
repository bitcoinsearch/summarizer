    <summary>In the discussion regarding transaction broadcasting, there's acknowledgment of the inherent risks involved. However, it's pointed out that using a full-node for broadcasting a de-dusting transaction doesn't compromise privacy more than any other transaction would. The example provided to illustrate this point is the [ddust tool](https://github.com/bubb1es71/ddust), which includes an option for users to broadcast transactions through their local bitcoind node, a requirement for its operation. This approach underscores the importance of utilizing secure and private methods for transaction broadcasting, especially in contexts where privacy concerns are paramount.</summary>
