    <summary>Hornet is an initiative concentrating on the consensus mechanisms within the protocol, aiming to establish a clear, declarative, and executable specification of consensus rules. This endeavor also showcases an innovative engineering approach geared towards rapid and memory-efficient validation and synchronization processes. A key feature of Hornet's architecture is its layered design, which distinctly segregates consensus from mempool and policy aspects, ensuring a streamlined and focused development in each area. This structure facilitates enhanced performance and scalability by allowing for targeted optimizations and updates without interfering with other components of the system.</summary>
