    <summary>The simplex algorithm is a method used in linear programming for solving optimization problems. It operates by maintaining a set of n-1 variables, designated as **free variables**, which are initially set to zero. The remaining variables, known as **basic variables**, are then determined based on these free variables through a series of calculations. These calculations involve the use of m+1 equations, contrary to the common misconception that it requires m+2 equations. This adjustment in understanding is crucial for accurately applying the simplex algorithm to optimization challenges.

Furthermore, within the context of the simplex algorithm, the optimization target, represented as $g$, should not be misconstrued as a variable. Similarly, the goal function, expressed mathematically as $g = \sum_i t_i \mathrm{fee}$, should not be treated as one of the equations utilized in determining the basic variables. This distinction is important for a correct application of the simplex algorithm, ensuring that the number of equations corresponds precisely to the number of basic variables to be computed. This nuanced understanding of the algorithm's components and their interrelations is essential for leveraging its full potential in solving optimization problems efficiently and effectively.</summary>
