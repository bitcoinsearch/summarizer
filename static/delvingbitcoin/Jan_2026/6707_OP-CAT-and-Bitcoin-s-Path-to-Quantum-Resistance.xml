    <summary>This summary provides insights into a specific type of cybersecurity threat, referred to as a "short-range" attack. The term highlights the proximity required between the attacker and the target for the attack to be successful. Such attacks necessitate the physical closeness of the threat actor to the victim's digital devices or networks, indicating a limited but focused operational range that could significantly impact security measures and protocols. Understanding and acknowledging the existence and specifics of short-range attacks are crucial for developing more robust defense mechanisms against such targeted cybersecurity threats.</summary>
