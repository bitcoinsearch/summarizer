    <summary>Ethan Heilman, Isabel Foxen Duke, and Hunter Beast have initiated a thorough revision of BIP 360 in response to community feedback seeking clearer documentation. This overhaul was chosen over minor edits due to significant technical updates previously made, which necessitated a new approach to enhance the proposal's clarity and effectively communicate the strategy for mitigating risks associated with quantum computing. The revised version of BIP 360 continues to reject the inclusion of post-quantum signature schemes but introduces a novel output type known as &quot;Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH).&quot; This addition aims to protect against vulnerabilities in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that could be exploited by advancements in quantum computing or other cryptographic technologies. By omitting the key path spend, P2TSH strengthens Bitcoin's defenses against potential threats to ECC, marking a crucial step towards quantum resistance. Furthermore, the updated proposal enriches its technical framework by incorporating test vectors in Python and Rust, making the proposed changes more accessible and easier to implement. The authors encourage community review of these modifications at the [BIP Repo](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1670) and on [BIP360.org](http://bip360.org), demonstrating their commitment to enhancing Bitcoin's security through collective effort.
The terminology Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH) raises concerns regarding future compatibility and clarity, especially with the possible introduction of new tapleaf versions that might include Simplicity—a high-level programming language for smart contracts and blockchain applications. This situation underscores the importance of selecting names that clearly reflect the functionality and compatibility of different transaction types, considering the evolving complexity of blockchain technology and its components. Future-proof naming conventions are vital for preventing obsolescence or misinterpretation as the ecosystem expands and diversifies, aiding in the seamless integration of new features and technologies.
A proactive approach toward defending cryptocurrency transactions from potential threats posed by quantum computing emphasizes eliminating conventional signatures. Leveraging TXHASH for a multi-step secret reveal mechanism enables secure vaulting and spending of coins under advanced quantum scenarios without new signature schemes. This shift towards script-only transactions, incorporating operations like OP_CTV and OP_TXHASH, signifies an important move towards quantum resistance, with further details available at [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/a-quantum-resistance-script-only-using-op-ctv-op-txhash-and-no-new-signatures/2168).
There's a clarification needed regarding the term initially thought to describe a `scriptPubKey` involving a hash of a BIP-342 tapscript. A more accurate description would be &quot;pay to script tree merkle root,&quot; reflecting the concept's essence more precisely than P2TSH, by emphasizing it's not merely a hash of a script but a Merkle root, and its application extends beyond tapscript alone.
The choice of P2TSH, influenced by its phonetic similarity and visual alignment with existing Bitcoin protocol elements, reflects a balance between aesthetic cohesion and technical representation. Despite alternative suggestions, P2TSH was favored for its continuity and clarity within Bitcoin's evolving transaction nomenclature. This decision also acknowledges the subjective nature of naming conventions in technology, where balancing form and function is critical for widespread adoption and understanding.
Pay to Script Tree (P2ST) represents a significant advancement in enhancing the security and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. It allows locking funds to multiple conditions encoded in a script, broadening the possibilities for transaction verification and execution. This mechanism supports the creation of complex smart contracts and conditional transactions such as multi-signature, escrow, and time-locked transactions, contributing to a more versatile blockchain infrastructure. P2ST offers improved privacy and efficiency over earlier methods by condensing complex conditions into a single hash, facilitating a simpler and more private transaction process. Its backward compatibility ensures a smoother adoption process across platforms, highlighting P2ST's role in extending blockchain functionality, improving security and privacy, and providing greater flexibility in contract conditions.</summary>
