    <summary>In a recent performance comparison on a 32 core development workstation, two systems were evaluated for their efficiency in revalidating the entire mainnet chain, excluding script or signature validation processes. Bitcoin Core completed the task in 167 minutes, while Hornet UTXO(1) showcased significantly faster results, finishing in just 15 minutes. This comparison highlights the stark differences in processing times between the two systems, underlining Hornet UTXO(1)'s superior speed.

Furthermore, the inquiry seeks additional information regarding the hardware specifications used during the test, specifically asking about the RAM, swap, and storage details (whether HDD, SSD, NVMe, etc.). There's also interest in understanding the nature of the Hornet UTXO database's storage solution—whether it operates in-memory, on-disk, uses disk-backed memory, is cached to disk, etc., to gain a deeper insight into the architectural choices that contribute to its high performance.</summary>
