    <summary>The minimum transaction size for relay in Bitcoin has been updated to 65 bytes with the release of [Bitcoin Core 25.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/25.0/). This is a decrease from the previously required minimum of 82 bytes. A practical illustration of a transaction that adheres to this new requirement can be seen through a [mainnet example](https://mempool.space/tx/cdaf44120c3dd94aae3771e90dcb0059a0c556e82abf9f9c741565275aa68f7a), which showcases a 75-byte transaction. Notably, this transaction includes 13 bytes dedicated to OP_RETURN data.

To ensure transactions meet the minimum size requirement while optimizing for blockspace efficiency and feerate improvement, utilizing an `ANYONECANPAY|ALL` signature is recommended. Specifically, when creating a transaction that spends to a single 0 satoshi output with a 3-byte OP_RETURN containing the text `"ash"`, it not only ensures compliance with the 65-byte limit but also facilitates the combination of transactions. This technique results in a blockspace saving of 23 bytes per input alongside a corresponding increase in feerate, demonstrating a strategic approach to transaction creation within the Bitcoin network's parameters.</summary>
