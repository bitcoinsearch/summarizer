    <summary>The proposal under discussion focuses on a mechanism that does not depend on numerical points (NUMS) for its operation. Instead, it introduces an alternative approach where the primary fallback or safety mechanism is a return to the original construction of the system. This design choice inherently limits the potential damage an attacker can inflict, confining their actions to causing disruption or "griefing" rather than enabling them to expend resources from the system. This strategic decision to decouple the operational dependency from NUMS and rely on the foundational structure as a safeguard offers a nuanced perspective on enhancing system resilience against malicious activities. By doing so, it emphasizes the importance of a robust baseline defense that curtails the extent of harm an adversary can achieve, focusing solely on the prevention of resource depletion.</summary>
