    <summary>The configuration and scalability of Bitcoin nodes vary significantly depending on their use cases. Public instances of Bitcoin nodes are designed to handle high volumes of requests efficiently, showcasing their ability to serve a substantial user base without degradation in performance. This capability is attributed to the inherent design of Bitcoin software, which establishes connections with 8 peers at any given time, ensuring a robust and distributed network.

On the other hand, private node instances present a different scenario. These nodes, while integral to the Bitcoin network, do not possess the same capacity for handling millions of users as their public counterparts do. The limitation primarily stems from their configuration and intended use case, which does not necessitate or often even support such high demand levels.

However, it's crucial to note that with proper configuration, a private Bitcoin node could be optimized to serve demands similar to those handled by public instances. This involves careful planning and understanding of the node's capabilities and limitations, as well as applying best practices in network management and optimization. Through this approach, private nodes can significantly enhance their service capacity, contributing to the robustness and resilience of the overall Bitcoin network.</summary>
