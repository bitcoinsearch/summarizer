    <summary>Determining the optimal number for a specific operation can involve various considerations, and it's evident that there might be multiple suitable values. However, in the absence of compelling reasons to deviate, it seems prudent to adhere to the initially proposed value of 600 seconds. To ensure thoroughness, reaching out to the mining development mailing list for further insights or overlooked aspects is a planned step. This approach underscores the importance of community input in refining technical parameters, highlighting a methodical process in decision-making.</summary>
