However, upon further consideration, the programmer realized that when dealing with sequences like `A B C`, it is more logical to arrange them from smallest to largest. This adjustment underscores a thoughtful approach to enhancing code readability and efficiency by aligning the sequence order with natural numerical or alphabetical ordering.</summary>
