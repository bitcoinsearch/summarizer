    <summary>The recent update to our repository includes significant enhancements, specifically the addition of Groups 1 &amp; 2. Alongside these additions, the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) manager has been updated, and suitable tests have been integrated to ensure functionality and reliability. This comprehensive update ensures that all post-quantum algorithms included in the repository have been thoroughly checked and verified for performance and compatibility, with one notable exception. The algorithm 'SQIsign' presents a unique case; it has not yet received standardization by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This situation raises an important discussion point regarding whether to retain or remove 'SQIsign' from our collection, considering its current standing with NIST.</summary>
