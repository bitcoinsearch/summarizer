    <summary>The discussion in the original post (OP) did not clearly present arguments that would suggest a need for more restrictive measures concerning the Minimum Tradable Price (MTP). The concern was primarily about the MTP being set too low, indicating an apprehension towards the potential undervaluation rather than its upper limits. There's an open stance on whether the MTP could be significantly higher, showcasing a neutrality towards the possibility of increasing the threshold. This suggests a flexibility or uncertainty in defining the optimal value for the MTP, pointing towards an ongoing evaluation of what constitutes an appropriate minimum level for trading activities.</summary>
