    <summary>In the provided context, there's a focus on the behavior of specific operations based on the value of `n`. When `n` equals 0, the operation is designed to return the sum of all input amounts that share the same script. This functionality is crucial for transactions involving multiple inputs with identical scripts, providing a consolidated view of the total input amount.

For cases where `n` is less than 0, the operation takes an interesting turn by calculating the sum of the last absolute value of `n` input amounts, including the current one. This feature is particularly useful for analyzing transactions in a rolling window format, allowing users to assess the total input amounts over the most recent entries up to a specified limit.

Conversely, when `n` is greater than 0, the operation shifts its focus to the beginning of the transaction, summing up the first `n` input amounts. This capability enables a forward-looking analysis of transactions, giving users insight into the initial contributions without considering the entire transaction volume.

Two critical questions arise concerning the limitations of these operations. First, there's an inquiry about whether `OP_INPUTAMOUNTS` can handle values exceeding 31 bits, roughly equivalent to 21 BTC. This question is significant given the potential for transactions to involve substantial sums, necessitating an understanding of the operation's upper limit. Similarly, the second question probes the capability of `OP_TEMPLATEHASH` to accept input amounts over 31 bits. This inquiry highlights the need for clarity on the scope and limitations of these operations, ensuring they can accommodate larger transactions efficiently.</summary>
