    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the importance of linking BMM transactions in a sequence, where each new transaction is designed to spend a specific output, labeled as the "canonical" `1234sat`, from its predecessor. This structured approach ensures that all transactions are interconnected in a continuous chain. Instances where this chain appears broken can usually be attributed to testing phases. During these periods, the existing transaction chain might be temporarily abandoned for experimentation or debugging purposes, before finalizing and sharing the outcomes publicly. This practice allows for thorough verification and refinement of the transaction process, ensuring its reliability and integrity when made accessible to a broader audience.</summary>
