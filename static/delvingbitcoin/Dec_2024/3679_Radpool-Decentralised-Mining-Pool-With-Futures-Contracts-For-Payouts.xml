    <summary>The discussion around Radpool and Braidpool's development timelines suggests that Radpool might be completed sooner. This observation stems from the realization that many components from one proposal could be repurposed for the other, indicating a level of flexibility and efficiency in their development process. The concept of building delay-tolerant protocols emerges as a significant consideration. The notion is that protocols capable of handling delays not only enhance the robustness of interactive systems but also ensure that they can operate effectively under various conditions, including those with less predictable timing. The emphasis on well-defined timing within these protocols underscores the importance of reliability and predictability in communications and operations, suggesting that such qualities are fundamental to the success and functionality of future interactive systems.</summary>
