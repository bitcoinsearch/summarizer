    <summary>The discussion revolves around the concept of miners operating as Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to potentially circumvent any associated fees. The idea posits that while miners would need to invest capital upfront, this strategy could technically allow them to manage their operations without incurring additional expenses. This approach raises questions regarding the feasibility and implications of miners having Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) with no inherent value, essentially suggesting that miners would be allocating funds to themselves. The inquiry seeks clarification on the specific "fees" being avoided through this model, suggesting a need for a deeper understanding of the financial and operational mechanics at play when miners assume the role of MSPs.</summary>
