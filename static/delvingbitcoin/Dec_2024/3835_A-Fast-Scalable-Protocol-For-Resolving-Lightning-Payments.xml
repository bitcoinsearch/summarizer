    <summary>The revised paper, now available as version 1.1 at [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnLaw2/ln-opr), incorporates feedback from Matt and Dave to highlight the speed and scalability improvements introduced by the OPR protocol. The document elaborates on how the security measures of the OPR protocol are similar to those of the existing Lightning protocol, especially in the context of processing small payments. It emphasizes that adherence to the protocol by all parties involved is crucial for maintaining a positive long-term reputation and for preventing theft. This alignment in protocol adherence underscores the shared goal of ensuring secure transactions across both platforms.</summary>
