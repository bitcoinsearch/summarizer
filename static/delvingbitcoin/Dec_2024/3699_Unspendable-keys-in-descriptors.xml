    <summary>The discussion revolves around the standardization requirements for wallet policies, particularly in handling taproot addresses and the associated public keys (`pubkeys`). The challenge mentioned involves wallet policies that may list the same `@i` multiple times. To address this issue, a method of sorting and removing duplicate extended public keys (xpubs) before concatenating them and applying a SHA256 hash is suggested as the simplest implementation strategy. This approach necessitates a restriction where all xpubs adhere to the specific format `xpub/&lt;0;1&gt;/*`, explicitly excluding the use of [optional derivation paths](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/532c4c10f2e04b3dca7d39ce1b1a4bdbf0c88e52/bip-0388.mediawiki). The rationale behind this limitation is to streamline the process, considering that legacy wallets, which might require such optional paths, would unlikely support taproot features. This proposal aims at creating a uniform standard for internal xpubs across descriptors and wallet policies by eliminating redundancies, thereby facilitating a more efficient and simplified system for managing public keys within wallet software.</summary>
