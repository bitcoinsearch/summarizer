    <summary>The recent pull request on GitHub, found at [https://github.com/vostrnad/inquisition.observer/pull/1](https://github.com/vostrnad/inquisition.observer/pull/1), introduces a notable improvement to the project. However, it has been suggested that incorporating statistics for transactions that generate bare CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) outputs could significantly enhance the utility of the analysis. This addition would allow for a deeper understanding of the usability and potential issues surrounding CTV outputs, specifically focusing on instances where users might face difficulties in spending these outputs after their creation, particularly during testing phases. This enhancement aims at providing a more comprehensive overview of the CTV output's functionality and its interaction within the system, highlighting any potential areas for improvement or further investigation.</summary>
