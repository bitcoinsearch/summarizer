    <summary>The process of validating new transactions within the JDS (Job Distribution System) poses notable challenges in terms of scalability and efficiency. When a `DeclareMiningJob` transaction is introduced, it necessitates verification for validity, which involves its incorporation into the system's mempool. This step can require the eviction of other transactions that conflict with the new entry, further complicating the process. Despite these hurdles, the current mechanism represents the most effective compromise discovered thus far, balancing scalability concerns with the operational capabilities of a mining pool. The strategy, while not perfectly scalable, supports the necessary functions of a pool, indicating a deliberate trade-off between operational efficiency and the system's ability to scale.</summary>
