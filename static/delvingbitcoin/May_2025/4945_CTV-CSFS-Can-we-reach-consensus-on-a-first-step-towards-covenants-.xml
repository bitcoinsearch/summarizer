    <summary>In 2010, a significant change was made to the Bitcoin codebase, specifically involving the removal of the operation code (op code) named 'CAT'. This alteration can be traced back to a commit on GitHub, accessible through this [link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/4bd188c4383d6e614e18f79dc337fbabe8464c82diff-8458adcedc17d046942185cb709ff5c3R94). The motivation behind this change was linked to an incident that highlighted a critical vulnerability within the Bitcoin system, known as the "Value Overflow Incident". Detailed information about this occurrence can be found on the dedicated page at [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident).

The removal of 'CAT' from the Bitcoin protocol was not arbitrary but a direct response to the exposure of a flaw that could potentially undermine the integrity and security of the network. The discovery and subsequent resolution of such vulnerabilities are crucial in the evolution and strengthening of cryptographic currencies like Bitcoin. By addressing these issues, developers ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the digital currency ecosystem.</summary>
