    <summary>The case study delves into the innovative application of Script opcodes, particularly focusing on implementing amount locks within blockchain transactions through the use of `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY`. This exploration builds upon two pivotal proposals: enhancing Script with 64-bit arithmetic capabilities and introducing `OP_IN_AMOUNT` and `OP_OUT_AMOUNT` to manage transaction input and output values directly within the Script. These enhancements are aimed at ensuring that the transaction amounts adhere to specified conditions without needing to start from scratch but rather by retrofitting existing opcode proposals.

Amount locks, as discussed, restrict transaction values to meet certain predefined conditions. In contrast to destination locks which control where funds may be sent, amount locks focus solely on the value constraints of inputs and outputs. The case study revisits the original `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` proposal, proposing a shift from mode-based amount locks to a more direct implementation using the aforementioned opcodes. This shift not only simplifies the execution but also expands the flexibility and potential applicability of amount locks within scripts.

The technical breakdown includes a detailed look at the witness stack for `OP_CCV`, outlining how transaction elements such as indices and modes are managed within the stack to implement the amount locks. Four distinct modes were initially defined in the `OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY` BIP, each catering to different aspects of transaction validation without necessarily enforcing amount constraints. However, the case study proposes modifications to these modes to incorporate amount locks efficiently, illustrated through Python implementations and test cases showcasing the practical application of these changes.

A comprehensive script demonstrates the adaptability of this approach, allowing for dynamic selection of modes based on the transaction's requirements. This "one big beautiful Script" concept underscores the versatility and potential customization offered by integrating amount locks directly into the Script.

The insights gained from this case study highlight several key advantages, including enhanced extensibility, which allows for the introduction of new features without necessitating soft forks. It also emphasizes the importance of separating concerns, such as distinguishing between destination and amount locks for more refined covenant proposals. Moreover, the discussions revisit the necessity of specific opcodes like `OP_LSHIFT`/`OP_RSHIFT` to facilitate the efficient manipulation of bitvectors corresponding to input/output indices, underscoring the continuous evolution and optimization of script capabilities in blockchain technologies.</summary>
