    <summary>The discussion involves a clarification of the concepts of TCP reassembly and IP reassembly, particularly in the context of syncing a bitcoind node. The observation was made that during this process, it was not IP fragmentation that was occurring, as initially thought, but rather TCP reassembly. This distinction is crucial because, in practice, routers typically do not fragment IP packets. Instead, what happens is that TCP segments the data to fit within the maximum transmission unit (MTU) for IP packet transmission. This process ensures that packets are transmitted efficiently across the network without exceeding the size limits imposed by the network path, thus avoiding potential issues related to packet size and transmission. Furthermore, the mention of a limit referred to by @tnull underscores the technical constraints inherent in network communications, specifically relating to how data is segmented and reassembled to maintain the flow of information between nodes on a network.</summary>
