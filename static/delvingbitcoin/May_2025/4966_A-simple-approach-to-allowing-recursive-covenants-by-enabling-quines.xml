    <summary>The concept of OP_ASSERT_OUTPUT is introduced as a simplified alternative to OP_CTV, aimed at reducing complexity by focusing on individual transaction outputs rather than the entire transaction. This approach allows for greater flexibility and specificity in targeting outputs, which is a central aspect of covenants in blockchain transactions. By enabling multiple calls for different outputs, OP_ASSERT_OUTPUT adheres to the pattern established by OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, concentrating on specific transaction components.

The primary motivation behind developing OP_ASSERT_OUTPUT is to facilitate gaming over state channels, an area yet to fully emerge. The creator of this concept has completed a proof of concept, demonstrating its practical application in enabling game play through state channels without the need for additional modifications. Having dedicated several years to this project, the developer possesses a comprehensive understanding of the requirements to make this functionality viable, highlighting their deep commitment and insight into the potential of state channel gaming.</summary>
