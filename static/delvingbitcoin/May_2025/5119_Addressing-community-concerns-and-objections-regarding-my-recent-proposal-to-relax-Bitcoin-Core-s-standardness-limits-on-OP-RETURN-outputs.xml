    <summary>The discussion highlights the ongoing debate surrounding Bitcoin Core's standardness rules and their impact on the ecosystem, particularly regarding the use of private APIs or alternative peer-to-peer relays by JPEGers. The argument posits that while there may be a temporary cost to JPEGers for adapting to tightened standardness rules, these costs are deemed minimal compared to the benefits, notably discouraging unnecessary mining centralization pressure. This reflects an understanding that Bitcoin Core has consistently prioritized mitigating mining centralization as a core concern for the network's health and user interests.

Further, the conversation addresses misconceptions regarding proposals to alter standardness rules specifically to benefit Citrea or similar systems. It clarifies that such changes are not intended to cater to any particular side system but rather aim to correct incentives that lead to the creation of forever-unspendable outputs, which are viewed as detrimental to the network. The critique extends to certain arguments perceived as strawman tactics, emphasizing that the focus should remain on the broader implications of current standardness rules rather than individual cases like Citrea's usage.

An additional point raised involves the practices of large miners who already process transactions that might be affected by these standardness rules. It is suggested that Bitcoin Core should inherently support the relay and inclusion of these transactions in block templates as standard practice, pointing towards a need for adjustment in the project's approach to ensure alignment with existing mining activities. This aspect introduces a practical consideration into the debate, suggesting that adjustments to standardness rules could harmonize Bitcoin Core's functionality with the operational realities of significant network participants. The discussion also incorporates a link to further information, facilitating deeper exploration of the topic at hand.</summary>
