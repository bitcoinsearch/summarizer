    <summary>Regtest, short for regression testing mode, is a feature that allows developers to operate on a private blockchain exclusively accessible on one's own computer. This mode is particularly useful for development and testing purposes, enabling programmers to have full control over the blockchain environment. It facilitates the testing of new features or the debugging of existing functionalities without the risk of affecting the live blockchain network. By using regtest, developers can initiate transactions, mine blocks, and test various scenarios in a sandboxed environment that mimics the behavior of the actual blockchain but within a controlled setting.

This isolated testing environment ensures that any experimental code or potential bugs do not interfere with the main network. It provides an ideal setup for developers to experiment with blockchain technology, understand its nuances, and develop applications with a clearer insight into how they would perform in real-world situations. Regtest mode, therefore, becomes an indispensable tool for developers looking to innovate and enhance blockchain applications securely and efficiently.</summary>
