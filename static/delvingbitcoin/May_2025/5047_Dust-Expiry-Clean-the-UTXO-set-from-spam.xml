    <summary>The integration of a 2-octet-long anecdotal code, derived from a SHA256 32-byte-long hash, into the development of a "Bitcoin Core Light" node represents an innovative approach towards optimizing blockchain technology. This proposed solution aims to streamline the communication process within the network by incorporating Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs on-demand, thereby facilitating transactions that require less storage space. Importantly, this method promises to maintain the integrity and verification standards of current Bitcoin Core nodes without necessitating any modifications to the existing blockchain via soft or hard forks. This concept underscores a potential advancement in making blockchain technology more efficient and accessible, reflecting a thoughtful consideration of the balance between maintaining robust security measures and improving system scalability.</summary>
