    <summary>In exploring optimal strategies for avoiding xpub derivation reuse across wallets while maintaining a user-friendly approach, a specific derivation path format is proposed. The suggested format, `m/87'/0'/0'/[UNIX-TIME]/{0,1}/*`, incorporates UNIX time to uniquely distinguish between derivation paths in an intuitive manner. This method stands out because it leverages a universally understandable metric—time—as opposed to block height (`H`), which, although smaller numerically, may not be as readily grasped by all users. Furthermore, the use of either UNIX time or block height in the derivation path offers the added benefit of serving as a rescan hint, significantly enhancing the functionality and future usability of the system. For more detailed discussions on this topic, one can refer to the thread available at [delvingbitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/avoiding-xpub-derivation-reuse-across-wallets-in-a-ux-friendly-manner/1644/7). This approach underlines the importance of adopting user-friendly yet secure methodologies in cryptocurrency wallet design, ensuring that even in the distant future, users can easily navigate and understand their transaction histories without compromising security.</summary>
