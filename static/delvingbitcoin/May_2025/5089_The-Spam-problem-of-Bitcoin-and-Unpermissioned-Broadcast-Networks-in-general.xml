    <summary>The concept of "layer-0" in the context of technology and networking is often debated, with various interpretations existing. However, one perspective posits that if there is to be considered a layer-0, it should be the internet. This viewpoint stems from the understanding that the internet serves as a foundational platform upon which additional layers and technologies are built and developed. The argument suggests that alternative definitions attempting to pinpoint what constitutes layer-0 tend to complicate rather than clarify the discussion. By recognizing the internet as the most fundamental layer, it simplifies the conceptual framework and acknowledges the internet's role as the base infrastructure enabling further technological advancements and innovations.</summary>
