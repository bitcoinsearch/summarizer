    <summary>The correspondence highlights optimism regarding the future of quantum computing, acknowledging current skepticism but pointing to ongoing work that suggests a promising outlook. The focus is on the practical application once quantum computing becomes more feasible, with an emphasis on addressing immediate concerns in the field. Specifically, the discussion acknowledges the need to move away from address re-use, a recognized bad practice, and highlights efforts aimed at mitigating short-range attack vulnerabilities. This approach is part of a broader strategy to enhance security and encourage more careful practices among users. The ultimate goal mentioned is to motivate individuals towards greater caution, suggesting that even incremental improvements in this area would represent significant progress.</summary>
