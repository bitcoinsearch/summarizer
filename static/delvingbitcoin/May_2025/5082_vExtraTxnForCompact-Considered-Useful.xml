    <summary>The discussion revolves around the utility of vExtra in non-filtering nodes within a network. Despite these nodes not engaging in additional filtering compared to their counterparts, vExtra has proven to be somewhat beneficial. This suggests that while the original implementation might have utilized a significantly large buffer, which may not be entirely justifiable, opting for a smaller increase in buffer size could potentially yield similar advantageous outcomes. This insight highlights an area of network design where efficiency can be enhanced without necessarily adhering to the initial specifications regarding buffer size, suggesting a reevaluation of resource allocation towards a more optimized and cost-effective approach.</summary>
