    <summary>The content highlights the potential for optimizing network bandwidth across nodes, suggesting that current proposals could indeed shift bandwidth into becoming a decisive limitation for a broader array of nodes. This discussion implies that the issue might not be solely about the number of nodes currently limited by bandwidth but also about the strategies employed to mitigate such limitations. One such strategy mentioned is the adoption of more efficient serialization methods for transactions, which could significantly reduce both bandwidth and storage requirements by approximately one-third. This approach hints at the technical possibilities for enhancing network efficiency and performance without necessarily expanding the existing infrastructure, thereby addressing both current and future concerns regarding bandwidth limitations within networks.</summary>
