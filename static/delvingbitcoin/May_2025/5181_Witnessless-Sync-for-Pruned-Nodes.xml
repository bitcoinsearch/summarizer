    <summary>The discussion highlights the potential for optimizations in network bandwidth usage, particularly through proposals that could shift more nodes to be predominantly limited by bandwidth rather than other factors. The current scenario where only a small fraction of nodes are constrained primarily by bandwidth is noted, suggesting that this might change with improved efficiency measures. An example provided is the implementation of a more efficient serialization method for transactions, which could significantly reduce bandwidth requirements—as well as storage needs if applied there—by approximately one-third. This approach points towards a broader strategy for enhancing network performance and scalability by focusing on the optimization of data handling and transmission techniques.</summary>
