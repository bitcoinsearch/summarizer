    <summary>In the realm of blockchain and cryptocurrency, the debate surrounding the OP_RETURN function and its implications for protocols like the watchtower light-client protocol illuminates a complex challenge. This protocol exemplifies the necessity for certain transactions to embed a specific amount of data—in this case, 144 bytes—within a single transaction. This requirement challenges the commonly held belief that splitting data across multiple transactions is always a viable solution for data storage on the blockchain. The discussion extends to the broader benefits of modifying current policies to ease the creation of more optimal block templates. Such modifications could potentially diminish the reliance on centralized template providers by simplifying the process for miners, thus fostering a more decentralized and efficient framework for transaction processing.

The [Consensus Cleanup proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/72af87fc72999e3f0a26a06e6e0a7f3134236337/bip-0054.md) addresses some of these concerns. However, questions remain about the tangible benefits of the proposed changes, particularly in terms of quantifying the ease they would bring to building optimal block templates. Critics argue that the advantages need to be clearly defined and justified, especially when considering the potential for a soft fork. The conversation also touches on the role of centralized template providers and whether their services genuinely offer a significant advantage over what miners can achieve independently. This discourse suggests a gap in understanding or agreement on the practical implications and benefits of such policy adjustments.

Furthermore, the discussion sheds light on the BitVM-related transactions, specifically focusing on the scenarios under which large nonstandard transactions become necessary. These transactions, often exceeding 100 KB, are typically only required in the event of a dispute within the bridge operation process. The rarity of such disputes suggests that the impact of these large transactions on block construction and mining efficiency might be minimal. Therefore, the necessity and urgency of implementing a soft fork to accommodate these cases are called into question. This perspective invites further examination of the actual incidence of large transactions and their anticipated frequency in the future, urging a careful consideration of whether such changes are indeed warranted based on the current and projected state of blockchain operations.</summary>
