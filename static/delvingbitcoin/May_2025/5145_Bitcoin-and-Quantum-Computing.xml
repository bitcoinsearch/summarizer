    <summary>The recent collaboration between our team and @deadmanoz has culminated in the publication of a comprehensive report addressing the implications of quantum computing on Bitcoin. This document explores the potential challenges and proposes several strategies for the Bitcoin ecosystem to adapt to the advent of quantum computing technology. The full report is accessible through this [link](https://chaincode.com/bitcoin-post-quantum.pdf), providing an in-depth analysis for those interested in understanding the nuances of this issue.

Quantum computing presents a unique set of challenges to the current cryptographic foundations of Bitcoin. As these computers become more powerful, they threaten to break the cryptographic security that protects Bitcoin transactions and wallets. The report meticulously examines these threats and evaluates their timelines based on the progression of quantum computing technologies. It is crucial for stakeholders in the Bitcoin community to be aware of these developments as they have significant implications for the security and viability of the cryptocurrency.

To address these impending challenges, the report outlines several potential pathways forward for Bitcoin. These include both short-term and long-term solutions aimed at enhancing the quantum resistance of Bitcoin's underlying technology. Among the recommended strategies are upgrades to quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and the implementation of specific network changes to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing advancements.

In conclusion, while quantum computing poses a serious threat to the cryptographic underpinnings of Bitcoin, proactive measures and strategic planning can help safeguard the future of the cryptocurrency. The report encourages an open dialogue within the community to explore these solutions further. Engaging with this challenge now will be critical to ensuring the resilience and security of Bitcoin in the face of quantum computing advancements.</summary>
