    <title>Dust Expiry: Clean the UTXO set from spam</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implications of introducing an additional hash for a root in every block header to manage some output tree, and its potential necessity for everyone to resync the chain. Instead, it suggests that utilizing txout proofs would be adequate, as the scenario where someone wishes to spend a dust Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) from a 1MB transaction after it might expire is highly improbable. Moreover, the proposal provides ample time for users to consolidate such dust outputs before its activation. This approach places the onus on users who wish to maintain these dust outputs, which are seen as a burden on the system due to their indistinguishability from spam, constituting half of the UTXO set. 

It is emphasized that this change would likely go unnoticed by the majority of regular users. For instance, a UTXO valued at $5 today would remain available for use for over 100 years, underscoring the minimal impact this proposal would have on everyday transactions while addressing the issue of spam within the system.</summary>
