    <summary>The discussion revolves around the integration of two methodologies, GGT and SFL, into a code base, highlighting that at least one of them is anticipated to be applied. There is an acknowledgment of prototype implementations for both, which have been subject to benchmarking exercises. The conversation tilts in favor of SFL, despite the recent uncovering of a significant limitation where it could theoretically execute indefinitely. This issue was detailed in a [discovery](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/spanning-forest-cluster-linearization/1419/6) related to its operational bounds. The narrative suggests a careful consideration of both techniques' advantages and potential drawbacks, emphasizing ongoing evaluation to guide the final decision on their adoption within the project framework.</summary>
