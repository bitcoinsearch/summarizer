    <summary>Recent experiments with syncing on a ramdisk, which significantly reduces I/O costs, suggest that synchronization processes are primarily bound by CPU and network capabilities when sufficient RAM is available. This observation points to an inherent inefficiency in the use of available computing resources, as the lack of parallelization means that, despite having multiple cores, typically only one is fully utilized at any given moment. This bottleneck is particularly evident when operating below the assumevalid height with default settings.

The introduction of Utreexo, aimed at reducing the RAM needed for fast validation, does not address this core issue of underutilization of CPU resources due to its potential to further complicate efforts towards improving parallelization. The phenomenon where synchronization appears mainly CPU-bound, especially while the UTXO set remains within the capacity of unused RAM, can be attributed to the opportunistic write-through memory caching employed by operating systems. This mechanism explains why nodes do not notably benefit from increased dbcache settings under these conditions.</summary>
