    <summary>The communication addresses a specific issue related to an overflow bug that does not affect the muhash value, ensuring its consistency across different versions. There is no included migration function within the final code version, despite initial experimentation with such a feature. The suggestion against developing an external script for index migration stems from a preference for a simpler solution.

The recommended approach for dealing with the mentioned issue involves utilizing an updated and synced version of the index from a fast machine. By transferring this updated index to the `index/coinstatsindex/` directory on a slower node, the problem can be circumvented. This method requires that the slow node's last block is ahead of the last block of the newly copied index, ensuring compatibility and functionality without the need for complex migration scripts or manual interventions.</summary>
