    <summary>The discussion revolves around the feasibility and potential improvements in the visualization of JPEG images through blockchain technology. The current method allows for embedding images in a blockchain via a specific operation, known as `op_return`, which can store data up to 100KB. This capability is significant because it suggests that the process of visualizing JPEG images from hexadecimal code could be simplified. The assumption was that a new approach to using `op_return` would make it easier to extract and view these images, reducing the complexity and the need for sophisticated tools. However, it appears that the proposed changes to `op_return` might not offer any substantial benefits over the existing methods in terms of simplifying the visualization process. This clarification underlines that the ease of converting hex into visible images remains unchanged, challenging the initial claim that a single op_return with a larger data capacity would inherently simplify the procedure.</summary>
