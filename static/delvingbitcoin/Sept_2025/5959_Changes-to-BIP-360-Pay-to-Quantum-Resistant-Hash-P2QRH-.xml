    <summary>In the exploration of cryptographic security in the face of quantum computing advancements, a significant vulnerability has been identified with P2TR (Pay to Taproot) addresses that are associated with NUMS (Nothing Up My Sleeve) points. This vulnerability centers on the ability of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) to compromise the tweaked key of a P2TR address without prior knowledge of whether the primary path utilizes a NUMS point or not. The implications of such an attack extend beyond mere theft, as it would serve as cryptographically provable evidence of a quantum computer's existence and its capability to break elliptic curve cryptography.

The process for demonstrating that a quantum computer was responsible for stealing funds from a wallet involves the original user revealing a valid script path spend alongside the NUMS point. This revelation would allow any external observer to verify conclusively that the funds were indeed stolen by a quantum computer breaking the tweaked key, rather than through traditional cryptographic failures. This scenario underscores a critical consideration in the ongoing dialogue about quantum resistance in cryptographic protocols and the urgent need for developing systems that can withstand the potential threats posed by quantum computing technology.</summary>
