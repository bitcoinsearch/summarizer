    <summary>The discussion highlights various methods of pushing data onto the blockchain, emphasizing that utilizing OP_RETURN is a comparatively better approach than some alternatives. For instance, one could consider employing a future version of Segwit to push data in large 4 MB continuous witness data chunks. This method, however, might not be as efficient or straightforward. Despite potential fragmentation across multiple outputs, transactions, and coins, the text points out that assembling 520-byte chunks remains a feasible task. The ease with which a parser can be developed to collect and display these fragmented pieces of data to users underscores the flexibility and accessibility of managing blockchain data. This capability suggests that concerns over data fragmentation might be overstated, given the right technical approaches and tools.</summary>
