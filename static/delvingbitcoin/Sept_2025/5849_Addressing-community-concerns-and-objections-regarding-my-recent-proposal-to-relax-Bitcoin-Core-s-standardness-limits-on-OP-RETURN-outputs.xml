    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the irrelevance of data encoding on its legality within the Bitcoin network. It is highlighted that achieving a large `OP_RETURN` output is currently feasible, even without changes to Bitcoin Core's policy, dismissing concerns over potential attackers' limitations. The critique extends to the proposed policy adjustments for Bitcoin Core regarding `OP_RETURN` outputs, asserting that such changes do not significantly alter existing risks. Instead, it is argued that the real threat to node operators stems from those who amplify public concern over these issues, rather than the technical aspects of the network itself. This perspective suggests that the fundamental risks associated with Bitcoin remain unchanged by policy modifications, and attention should rather focus on mitigating undue alarm raised by individuals outside the technical community.
