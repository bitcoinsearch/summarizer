    <summary>The discussion revolves around the implementation of Approach s2, which aligns with the descriptor changes outlined in a document linked by a colleague. This approach is noted for its straightforwardness and ease of explanation. Despite necessitating the inclusion of additional information within the descriptor, this is regarded as an acceptable tradeoff in favor of its simplicity. The assessment suggests that the benefits of implementing Approach s2, primarily owing to its uncomplicated nature, outweigh the minor drawback of increased descriptor complexity.</summary>
