    <summary>The current state of email responses has been temporarily disabled, which is attributed to concerns regarding spam. This issue is under investigation as there are potential risks that need to be addressed. The individual responsible for managing the email system, referred to as AJ, has been approached to consider re-enabling the email responses. However, due to the ongoing examination of these spam-related issues, it remains uncertain when functionality will be restored. The situation points towards a cautious approach being taken to ensure the integrity and security of the email system before reactivating the response feature.</summary>
