    <summary>The evolution of Bitcoin and its protocol changes have become increasingly politicized as the community around it grows. The concept of omnibus soft forks is presented as a potential solution to this issue. It suggests that due to the expanding diversity of stakeholders, achieving consensus for changes in the Bitcoin network necessitates appealing to a wide array of interests. This means that modifications to the protocol must offer benefits or incentives to various groups within the community to garner sufficient support.

The size or scale of proposed changes is becoming less significant compared to the political aspect of gaining consensus. As the 'tent'—or the community of people invested in Bitcoin—becomes larger, aligning the interests of all these parties becomes more challenging. The implication here is that the politics involved in making any changes to Bitcoin, including forks, are complex and require careful navigation to ensure enough people are on board for successful implementation. 

This reflection on the state of Bitcoin governance underscores the importance of strategy and compromise when proposing upgrades or alterations to the system. The pursuit of broad-based agreement might lead to the conclusion that omnibus soft forks, which bundle multiple features or improvements together, could stand a better chance of success than smaller, isolated proposals. This approach potentially satisfies a wider range of community members, facilitating the difficult process of change within a decentralized and politically diverse ecosystem.</summary>
