    <summary>The correspondence addresses a proposal for enhancing the security of taproot, a Bitcoin upgrade that allows users to set conditions for spending bitcoins. The author suggests implementing a soft-fork to restrict the usage of 'G,' which is currently recognized as an internal public key and can be seen as an obvious anyone-can-spend condition due to its quantum vulnerability. In order to future-proof the system against potential quantum computing threats, the idea is to create a quantum-resistant script-only Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) output.

Additionally, the author posits an interim solution involving the adoption of a specific Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point that the community could use by convention. This NUMS point would serve as a placeholder until the necessary protection is warranted and enacted. The concept implies that there would be a commitment to secure this point as needed in response to the evolving technological landscape, particularly concerning quantum computing advancements.

By considering these changes, the author is engaging with the community to evaluate the viability and potential impact of such a modification on the Bitcoin network's resilience to quantum decryption capabilities.</summary>
