    <summary>In a discussion about potential modifications to a system's transaction handling, the capacity of diagram checks was examined in relation to the number of clustered transactions. The conversation centered on the implications of removing the upper limit on conflicted transactions. Concerns were raised that eliminating this constraint may inadvertently increase the workload associated with diagram checks due to the potential for a high number of elements resulting from the product of maximum inputs per standard transaction and the cluster count limit. It was suggested that, should the bound on conflicted transactions be removed, it might become necessary to lower the maximum number of transactions permitted within a cluster to manage the system's workload effectively. This measure would serve as a control mechanism to prevent an excessive number of elements in a diagram check, ensuring that the system remains manageable and efficient.</summary>
