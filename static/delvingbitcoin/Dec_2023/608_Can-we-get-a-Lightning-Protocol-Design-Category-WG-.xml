    <summary>Mailing list mode in the context of website notifications is designed to send users all updates from the site. For those who prefer to receive updates only for specific categories or tags, an alternative approach is recommended. To customize the flow of information, users should disable mailing list mode. After disabling it, they can then choose to "watch" particular categories or tags of interest. Additionally, users have the option to adjust their notification settings to ensure that they receive emails for these watched categories or tags even when they are actively online. This approach allows users to tailor their email notifications to more relevant content, reducing the volume of emails and enhancing the overall experience with the site's communication features.</summary>
