    <summary>The Lightning-Dev mailing list is currently contemplating a transition to a new platform for conducting their work. A suggestion has been put forth to create an independent instance tailored specifically for their needs. The current system in use has the capability to send emails, known as mailing list mode, which is already activated. However, there appears to be a limitation within this feature; users are unable to filter and receive emails exclusively from a selected Category or Sub-Forum. This constraint poses a challenge as it prevents members from receiving only Lightning Network (LN)-specific content via email, which deviates from the existing setup that is in place. The conversation highlights the need for a more refined email filtering option to cater to the specific requirements of the Lightning-Dev group.</summary>
