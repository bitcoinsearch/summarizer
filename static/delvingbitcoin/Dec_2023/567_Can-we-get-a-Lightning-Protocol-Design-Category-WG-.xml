    <summary>The Lightning-Dev Mailing List (ML) community is contemplating a transition to a new platform for conducting its collaborative efforts. The primary consideration being discussed is whether the group should be positioned within an existing Protocol Design category, functioning as a working group, or if it warrants the creation of a dedicated category tailored to its needs. This decision hinges on the nature of the work and discussions that the Lightning-Dev ML engages in, and how these would fit into the broader structure of collaboration platforms. The outcome will impact how the community organizes itself and interacts, influencing the efficiency and accessibility of shared information and ongoing projects. The objective is to enhance communication and workflow within the Lightning-Dev ML while aligning with the overall framework of the platform they choose to migrate to.</summary>
