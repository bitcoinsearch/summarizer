    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Agustin Cruz introduced the *Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP)*, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal designed to safeguard the Bitcoin network against quantum computing threats by transitioning funds from legacy to quantum-resistant addresses. The proposal outlines a detailed plan for implementation, including backward compatibility and security considerations, and invites community feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxxx.md).\n\nJose Storopoli and Trey Del Bonis, among others at Alpen Labs, developed the Bitcoin Output Script Descriptor (BOSD) to enhance the standardness of on-chain withdrawals for Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, minimizing the risk of non-standard transactions. This open-source Rust implementation, available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bitcoin-bosd), aims to streamline validation logic, with detailed specifications and the motivation behind BOSD provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/alpenlabs/bitcoin-bosd/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md).\n\nPythcoiner has been working on joinstr, a library to support the development of privacy-centric applications for coinjoin, currently in an experimental stage. This effort signifies a broader engagement with developers to enhance privacy in digital currency transactions, inviting collaboration and feedback through email or simplex chat.\n\nAJ Towns highlighted the release of Bitcoin Inquisition 28.1, incorporating features from [Bitcoin Core 28.1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/28.1/) and supporting several proposed consensus changes to improve Bitcoin's operational framework. This version, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/releases/tag/v28.1-inq), also emphasizes the importance of establishing social consensus before implementing code changes, as discussed in the [bcap project](https://github.com/bitcoin-cap/bcap) and a guide on making consensus changes within Bitcoin, underscoring the necessity for widespread agreement and a cooperative approach to modifications in the network.",
