    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Gloria Zhao announces the release of Bitcoin Core version 29.0, featuring performance improvements, bug fixes, and new functionalities such as `-natpmp` for better IPv4 and IPv6 support, alongside a significant shift from Autotools to CMake in the build system, aimed at enhancing the software's development process. Users are advised to follow specific upgrade procedures based on their operating system and to consult the [official release notes](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-29.0/) for detailed information on all changes, including adjustments to P2P networking, mining, and the introduction of new RPCs to improve developer interactions with Bitcoin Core.\n\nJonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, and Yannick Seurin introduce DahLIAS, an innovative cryptographic protocol allowing for constant-size, interactive aggregate signatures compatible with secp256k1. This advancement, detailed in their [published paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf), presents a significant step forward in reducing transaction sizes and verification costs for Bitcoin and similar applications, marking a key development in the efficiency and scalability of cryptographic practices within digital currency systems.\n\nA debate surrounding the moderation guidelines in the Bitcoin Core metadata repository has emerged, with proponents arguing for the removal of such policies citing concerns over formal governance structures potentially influencing consensus rules. This discussion, fueled by references to decentralized development philosophies and legal considerations like the Berne Convention, underscores the tension between maintaining civility within the community and adhering to the foundational principle of decentralization. The dialogue encapsulates a broader discourse on the balance between structured governance and the anarchic ethos that has historically underpinned Bitcoin's development community, as detailed in [this forum post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/some-problems-with-current-bitcoin-core-moderation-md/1616).",
