    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Ava Chow announced the release of Bitcoin Core version 28.1, featuring enhancements like new peer-to-peer (P2P) configuration options and improved compatibility across various operating systems. This version also addresses certain bug fixes, introduces performance improvements, and updates translations. Users are advised to follow specific upgrade instructions, particularly when migrating from older versions, and can download the update from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1). Significant technical advancements include modifications to address port collisions and improvements in key handling and build systems.\n\nIn a separate discussion, mcelrath explored the development of covenant-based solutions for Bitcoin mining pools, focusing on secure and accurate transaction management without custody risks. By leveraging covenants, the proposal aims to ensure theft-proof payouts in alignment with a \"can't-be-evil\" philosophy, offering an alternative to the [FROST federation](https://github.com/pool2win/frost-federation) model. These covenants would enforce specific transaction paths, include safeguards against pool failures, and adjust for dynamic payout changes, highlighting a proactive approach to enhancing transaction security within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFinally, cdecker addressed the dynamics of channel finalization within blockchain networks, emphasizing the limited impact of attack strategies aimed at disrupting this process. The discussion highlighted mechanisms allowing victims to counter outdated updates published by attackers effectively, suggesting that collusive attacks requiring majority control are unlikely to achieve indefinite censorship. This analysis underscores the resilience of blockchain systems against such disruptions, though it acknowledges vulnerabilities in systems reliant on timelock or CSV mechanisms.
