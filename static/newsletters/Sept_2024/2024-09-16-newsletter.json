    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Ethan Heilman introduced a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to add a new opcode, FOLDFUNCTIONSTREAM, modifying the existing NOP4 opcode for more complex and safer script executions in Bitcoin, such as efficient hashing over concatenated strings. This proposal aims to address computational and memory concerns within Bitcoin's scripting language, suggesting activation via the BIP9 \"versionbits\" method for a cautious and phased deployment. The discussion also touches upon considerations for optimizing the opcode's security and practicality, with further details and a reference implementation available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/XXX).\n\ndgpv announced an update to B'SST on GitHub, shifting the project from a proprietary license to AGPLv3 with the update version 0.1.4, which includes a minor fix. This licensing change is intended to improve accessibility and foster a more inclusive development environment, as detailed [here](https://github.com/dgpv/bsst).\n\nJaswanth, a computer science student, is working on a project to enhance reward mechanisms in mining pools to defend against Fork After Withholding (FAW) attacks, aiming to design a system that tracks miner reputation through Proof of Partial Work (PPoW) submissions. This project seeks to improve the security of blockchain against fraudulent activities, with further insights and related studies accessible for additional reading on [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3133956.3134019).\n\nZmnSCPxj explored how Bitcoin's halvening events impact its economics and consensus mechanism, suggesting a 'Law of Ossification' that implies it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve consensus on changes as the Bitcoin community grows and new users integrate into the ecosystem. This evolving dynamic suggests a gradual stiffening of Bitcoin's protocol, potentially making significant changes harder to implement over time, a detailed discussion of which is available [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/modeling-social-consensus-about-cryptographic-consensus-change/1136).",
