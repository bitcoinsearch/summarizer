    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Recent discussions within the Bitcoin development community have touched on various aspects of the ecosystem, from updates on Bitcoin Core's security to proposals for enhancing Bitcoin's computational capabilities. Antoine Poinsot provided an update on the security status of Bitcoin Core, noting the absence of new vulnerabilities and advising users to upgrade to the latest version for optimal security. This proactive communication ensures the community remains informed and vigilant ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/PCICTEFQzuVnp0QSpl4KG8Sy2AHp1pVj8kqApUPSbnSwuF7FsidCpQnDsc-xwxfxKBJhLH3il2lrh71gkeUiXv71mkojRAfXEX_AAeWD0p8=@protonmail.com/T/#u#m0961ca009770bc2d72e6015cf7797585eac6a386)).\n\nIn parallel, Antoine Riard and Ava Chow have discussed initiatives aimed at strengthening the Bitcoin network's resilience and user engagement. Riard emphasized the importance of real-world testing for security improvements, proposing \"free-to-pwn\" lightning nodes to facilitate cross-layer attack demonstrations ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/a647a2e2-2742-4b0e-ae84-6f84b018136fn@googlegroups.com/T/#u#md98692398d3858c104cbee92637b05fecabc89f8)). Meanwhile, Chow announced the release candidate for Bitcoin Core version 28.0rc1, inviting community feedback to ensure the software's reliability and efficiency ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/7754f1e7-c4b0-4472-a357-4926da542363@achow101.com/T/#u#m3cd672eee98a2d3ba1b7a0c5b385399d75ca64fe)).\n\nContributions from Victor Kolobov and Fi3 focus on fostering community involvement in protocol development and enhancing mining transparency. Kolobov highlighted StarkWare's $1 million bounty for insights on activating OP_CAT, seeking to engage the community in meaningful discourse on Bitcoin's computational evolution ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/d707772f-dff9-4572-84bc-84173ff6303e@mattcorallo.com/T/#m59e5bf67ad30378d8a911b61c91831829fd9d586)). Fi3 discussed the development of an SV2 extension for mining pools, aiming to bring greater fairness and transparency to mining operations by allowing miners more control over transaction selection ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/pplns-with-job-declaration/1099)).\n\nOverall, these discussions reflect a dynamic and collaborative effort within the Bitcoin community to enhance the ecosystem's security, engage users in the development process, and expand Bitcoin's computational and operational capabilities.",
