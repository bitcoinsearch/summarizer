    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Antoine Poinsot and the Bitcoin Core team have disclosed a vulnerability within Bitcoin Core versions prior to 25.0, alongside announcing a new security policy aimed at enhancing transparency and security through regular updates on potential system vulnerabilities. Full details of the disclosed vulnerability and the new policy can be found on [Bitcoin Core's website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/09/18/disclose-headers-oom) and their [security advisories page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/security-advisories/policy), respectively.\n\nAva Chow highlighted the availability of Bitcoin Core version v28.0rc2 binaries, marking a significant step towards the final release of this new major version, with details and preliminary release notes accessible on [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/test.rc2) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.0rc2). This update signifies the release candidate stage, crucial for rigorous testing and final adjustments before the official launch.\n\nZmnSCPxj presented the SuperScalar mechanism, a novel construction for efficient offchain liquidity allocation in the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which utilizes Decker-Wattenhofer decrementing-`nSequence` mechanisms, timeout trees, and laddering strategies to address the Last-Mile Problem (LMP) without blockchain consensus changes. More in-depth discussion on this mechanism and its implications for the Lightning Network can be explored at [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/superscalar-laddered-timeout-tree-structured-decker-wattenhofer-factories/1143).\n\nFinally, halseth introduced the `utxozkp` tool, advancing privacy in Lightning Network channel announcements by enabling zero-knowledge proof of UTXO set inclusion. This development not only enhances privacy but also serves as a potential anti-DOS mechanism. The tool, based on the RISC Zero STARK platform and the Utreexo data structure, is still in its early stages, with details available for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/halseth/utxozkp/blob/c3402a72005d8d1058f758ed277df9e6cafcac72/README.md).",
