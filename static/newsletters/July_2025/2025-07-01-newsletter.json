    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Ava Chow announced the release of Bitcoin Core 28.2, which introduces new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements, aiming to make the software more accessible globally. This version, available for download on the [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.2/), maintains compatibility with older wallet versions and supports a wide range of operating systems. It emphasizes the importance of community contributions, acknowledging individuals like 0xB10C, achow101, and Sjors Provoost for their roles in the development process. Significant changes include improved build processes, compatibility adjustments, and documentation updates, with detailed instructions provided for upgrading from older versions.\n\nIn a separate discussion, roasbeef proposes reimagining onion messaging within the Lightning Network (LN) to address limitations of the current model by establishing an overlay layer bootstrapped using the LN gossip layer. This approach aims to enhance deployment speed, privacy, and payment efficiency by reducing reliance on the channel graph, allowing for incremental adoption and facilitating key management improvements. The technical foundation for the overlay involves a series of TLV-based handshake messages for secure onion messaging link establishment, promising better scalability, flexibility, and innovation in LN communications. The proposal, detailed at [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/reimagining-onion-messages-as-an-overlay-layer/1799), highlights the potential for a more efficient and private messaging infrastructure within the LN ecosystem.",
