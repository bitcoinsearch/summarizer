    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "The \"confidential-script-lib\" library, introduced at the BTC++ hackathon, proposes a novel approach for executing advanced scripts on Bitcoin's mainnet, leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like AWS's Nitro Enclave to ensure the confidentiality and security of transactions. This architecture enables the testing of new features and soft fork upgrades with minimal trust, utilizing a two-step emulation and signing process that enhances privacy and functionality. The failsafe mechanism and the emphasis on security through AWS's Key Management System (KMS) highlight the library's potential to serve as a middle ground in soft fork debates by demonstrating genuine demand for upgrades. [Confidential-Script-Lib](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/confidential-script-emulate-soft-forks-using-stateless-tees/1918)\n\nYnniv's proposal for a Layer 3 Protocol aims to transform Bitcoin transactions by introducing Zero UTXO Trust-Minimized Lightning Wallets, offering users greater control and eliminating certain operational limitations. This protocol leverages cross-validation networks and strategic recovery processes for enhanced security, scalability, and efficiency, potentially broadening Bitcoin's adoption through improved Lightning Network transactions. The protocol's innovative approach to managing liquidity, privacy, and security could redefine user and operator experiences, emphasizing the role of auditors in maintaining system integrity. [Layer 3 Protocol](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proposal-bitcoin-deposits-a-zero-utxo-trust-minimized-lightning-wallet/1922)\n\nThe discussion by zawy on the Qubic attack on Monero brings to light the importance of non-repurposability in securing Proof of Work (PoW) systems, contrasting ASIC-resistant and CAPEX-intensive PoWs in terms of security advantages. The conversation extends to the potential vulnerabilities of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to state-level actors aimed at undermining digital assets to maintain control over fiat currencies and financial surveillance. This analysis underscores the complexity of ensuring the security of cryptocurrency networks against a backdrop of technological innovation and the evolving landscape of threats, including state-sponsored attacks.
