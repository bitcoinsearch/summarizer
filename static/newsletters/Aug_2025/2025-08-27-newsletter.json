    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Jeremy introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for a new opcode, OP_TWEAKADD, aimed at enhancing Bitcoin's scripting capabilities by allowing for more efficient script execution. This proposal, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1944), seeks to introduce flexibility in Bitcoin scripting without requiring immediate modifications to existing infrastructure, encouraging community feedback for further refinement.\n\nLiam Eagen discussed an innovative approach named \"Glock\" for optimistic smart contract verification on Bitcoin, which significantly reduces on-chain data requirements and simplifies verification processes. This method, detailed in a [research paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1485) and supported by code on [GitHub](github.com/alpenlabs/dv-pari), leverages Garbled Circuits and advanced cryptographic techniques to enhance Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities while maintaining compatibility with current protocols.\n\nOlaoluwa Osuntokun proposed the addition of Elliptic Curve operation opcodes to Bitcoin's script, leveraging Taproot infrastructure to enable more dynamic smart contracts directly on the blockchain. This proposal, which is accessible [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1945), suggests a significant step forward in expanding Bitcoin's scripting abilities, catering to a variety of use cases including Discreet Log Contracts and partial musig2 signature verifications.\n\nMatias Monteagudo and Caraveo introduced separate BIPs aimed at enhancing Bitcoin's security and operational efficiency. Monteagudo's proposal focuses on covenant-only Taproot outputs to provide an additional security layer for institutional Bitcoin holdings, detailed [here](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/6778d5ec-91dc-4c3b-9718-581ec2cf7be6n@googlegroups.com), while Caraveo's BITCOIN C.H.I.P introduces a lending protocol that utilizes Bitcoin and HASH power as collateral, aiming to support miners and secure the network, as outlined in its [documentation](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-c-h-i-p-capital-hash-investment-protocol-bip/1941). These proposals represent significant advancements in Bitcoin's development, focusing on security, efficiency, and the expansion of its scripting capabilities.",
