    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "A meeting is set to discuss BIP 119's activation parameters, urging participants to prep with related pull requests and past meeting records, aiming for a productive dialogue on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List group [source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALiT-Zqo-gRCeMDd2VtmXL7Ox31OT3pFmsfXQ5mq6SzeuFnMzg@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#me7eb4a1d593c073163e2163e717798c4a62d8a8e). Defenwycke's DustSweep proposal introduces a solution for reducing Bitcoin's UTXO set by proposing a transaction category to consolidate uneconomical dust, with its draft for public review on GitHub [here](https://github.com/defenwycke/bip-dust-sweep). The exploration of hash-based post-quantum cryptographic solutions highlights their potential for Bitcoin, focusing on schemes like SPHINCS+ for their robustness against quantum attacks, with detailed insights provided in a report and supporting scripts available [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2203) and [here](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SPHINCS-Parameters).\n\nA soft fork proposal addresses the Bitcoin timestamp overflow issue, suggesting a method to extend functionality without a system overhaul, relying on miner and node compliance with new rules, detailed further on [Bitcoin Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/75831/what-is-time-warp-attack-and-how-does-it-work-in-general/7583475834). Victor introduces a non-custodial vault system, seeking feedback on using pruned nodes within Bitcoin's PSBT workflows for efficient UTXO management, aiming for a robust solution without custodial risks. Lastly, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems see a potential bridge via SatsBridge's protocol, integrating Lightning Network with Ethereum smart contracts to enhance cross-chain wallet security and user experience, with an invitation for community engagement on their [Telegram group](https://t.me/SatsBridge).",
