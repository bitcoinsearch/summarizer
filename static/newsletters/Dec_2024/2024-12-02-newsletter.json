    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Jeremy proposes a novel method for implementing Bitcoin covenants without altering the blockchain's native protocol, utilizing covenant emulators and signing servers. This approach relies on oracle signers depositing bonds, which are at risk if they authorize transactions violating covenant rules, ensuring compliance through financial penalties. The detailed framework and operational mechanics of this system are explored in a comprehensive paper available at [Jeremy's Paper on Bitcoin Covenants](https://rubin.io/bitcoin/2024/11/26/unfed-covenants/).\n\nA new initiative, as discussed by /dev /fd0, seeks to consolidate opinions from Bitcoin developers on covenant proposals, aiming to build consensus for future soft forks through a collaborative wiki page. This endeavor reflects the process used for SegWit support, with the wiki page inviting developers to contribute towards refining opcodes and sharing insights, particularly regarding OP_CTV, to enhance Bitcoin's functionalities such as covenants for pools and coinjoin improvements. The presentation detailing the rationale behind OP_CTV and its benefits can be found at [Rationale for OP_CTV](https://notes.dunst.be/slide//2/slide/view/Ekky-cAegV9dSOaNOjH9TStNOmAnrhDDc9hxHlmRs5M/embed/present/).\n\nAjtowns introduces the concept of \"Flexible Coin Earmarks,\" a method allowing the value of a single coin to be earmarked for various purposes, facilitating conditional spending within financial mechanisms like lightning networks, vaults, and payment pools. This approach promises to streamline transactions and improve security by enabling dynamic fund management and reducing the complexity of multi-party transactions. The potential for this concept to revolutionize blockchain applications is further discussed, with the full conversation available at [Flexible Coin Earmarks Discussion](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/flexible-coin-earmarks/1275).\n\nIn collaboration between sCrypt and StarkWare, a demo bridge covenant on Bitcoin illustrates the feasibility of connecting the Bitcoin blockchain to the Starknet Layer 2 network, demonstrating efficient management of deposits and withdrawals through a batched transaction system. This bridge utilizes a recursive covenant script and Merkle trees for secure transaction processing, with the detailed implementation and codebase accessible at [GitHub Repository for Bridge Covenant](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Wildlife-Sanctuary/scrypt-poc-bridge), showcasing a significant step towards enhancing Bitcoin's interoperability and smart contract capabilities.",
