Robert Netzke proposes a new file format for descriptor-based wallets, aiming to simplify the inheritance process for digital assets, with a reference implementation developed in Rust, advocating for the adoption of data encoding practices from Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) to enhance developer accessibility and wallet interoperability ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/4c51d18b-2444-4939-8f12-d0abe6d11e20n@googlegroups.com/T/#u#m0927acdfbd44f01a5509d914c9d12e44f95fe033)).\n\nThe release of Bitcoin Core version 27.2, announced by Michael Ford and fanquake, introduces bug fixes, performance enhancements, and supports a broad compatibility range across operating systems, with significant contributions from developers like Ava Chow, Cory Fields, and Matt Whitlock to ensure its ongoing evolution ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CAFyhPjWx0qSuBgBqboxWwWjkFZPbsWrEx8sW0Me8=kXQRppbbg@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#mdabc1118c9d2fe5e0e777e50d77308aa3fab2c41), [source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-core-27-2-released/1239)). Additionally, Antoine Poinsot discusses the latest security advisories for Bitcoin Core, emphasizing the project's commitment to transparent and responsible security practices, while ZmnSCPxj introduces SuperScalar, a mechanism designed to solve the Lightning Network's Last-Mile Problem by enhancing liquidity provisioning without blockchain consensus changes, focusing on security and scalability ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/uJpfg8UeMOfVUATG4YRiGmyz5MALtZq68FCBXA6PT-BNstodivpqQfDxD1JAv5Qny_vuNr-A1m8jIDNHQLhAQt8hj8Ee9OT6ZFE5Z16O97A=@protonmail.com/T/#u#m1bab216dee18c20e39cbf90f1261a736c18cd3a1), [source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/superscalar-laddered-timeout-tree-structured-decker-wattenhofer-factories-with-pseudo-spilman-leaves/1242)).",
