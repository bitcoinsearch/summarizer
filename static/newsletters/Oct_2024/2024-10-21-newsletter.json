    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Scott Beeker and Agustin Cruz have raised the urgency of integrating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms into the Bitcoin protocol, like SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Dilithium, to mitigate potential threats from quantum computing. These transitions necessitate significant changes in Bitcoin's core protocol, including adjustments to signature sizes and transaction structures, which could impact block size and network bandwidth ([Trail of Bits Blog](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/08/15/we-wrote-the-code-and-the-code-won/), [SLH-DSA GitHub Repository](https://github.com/slh-dsa/sloth), [Latacora Blog on Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://www.latacora.com/blog/2024/07/29/crypto-right-answers-pq/), [CSO Online](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3562701/chinese-researchers-break-rsa-encryption-with-a-quantum-computer.html/amp/), [https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md](https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md)).\n\nAndrew Toth and /dev /fd0 discuss enhancements to the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) format and address re-use issues, proposing solutions such as silent payments and adjustments to the mempool policy. These measures aim to enhance privacy and efficiency in Bitcoin transactions, though they highlight the need for broad consensus and careful implementation to avoid centralization and increased complexity ([https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/cde77c84-b576-4d66-aa80-efaf4e50468fn@googlegroups.com/T/#u#ma28015d36d7afba0a7738d191ef1d63074a9b25f](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/cde77c84-b576-4d66-aa80-efaf4e50468fn@googlegroups.com/T/#u#ma28015d36d7afba0a7738d191ef1d63074a9b25f), [https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/b383aad2-1abc-4b82-9851-1750b1b52f12n@googlegroups.com/T/#u#ma5658318128c12ee3958e6713df5d809230c7d5f](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/b383aad2-1abc-4b82-9851-1750b1b52f12n@googlegroups.com/T/#u#ma5658318128c12ee3958e6713df5d809230c7d5f)).\n\nAntoine Riard and MishaKomarov discuss the development of libbitcoinkernel and Bitcoin PIPEs, respectively, showcasing efforts to enhance Bitcoin's security and capability without altering its core protocol. These initiatives focus on isolating the consensus engine and introducing covenants for advanced spending rules, highlighting ongoing innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem to address security threats and expand functionality ([https://github.com/ariard/standalone-bitcoinkernel](https://github.com/ariard/standalone-bitcoinkernel), [https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-pipes-covenants-on-bitcoin-without-soft-fork/1195](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/bitcoin-pipes-covenants-on-bitcoin-without-soft-fork/1195)).\n\nEllemouton's discussion at a recent summit emphasizes the need for updates to protocol proposals, particularly in structuring new messages to enhance efficiency, security, and usability within the network. These proposed updates reflect the collaborative efforts of the community to refine and evolve the system, ensuring its adaptability to technological advancements and user needs ([https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/updates-to-the-gossip-1-75-proposal-post-ln-summit-meeting/1202](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/updates-to-the-gossip-1-75-proposal-post-ln-summit-meeting/1202)).",
