    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Ava Chow announced the release of Bitcoin Core version 28.0, available for download at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.0/), featuring new functionalities, bug fixes, performance boosts, and translation updates. This version introduces significant updates, including Testnet4/BIP94 support and improved JSON-RPC 2.0 support, alongside wallet enhancements and GUI improvements aimed at bolstering security, usability, and efficiency. Users are advised to report any encountered bugs on the project's GitHub issue tracker and are recommended to upgrade from older versions by shutting down their current version and replacing it with the new release, which supports direct upgrades from versions that have reached EOL.\n\nIn another development, AntoineP, alongside Niklas G\u00f6gge, identified and rectified a consensus bug in btcd, prompting the release of [btcd v0.24.2](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases/tag/v0.24.2) to address the vulnerability that allowed attackers to potentially hard fork btcd nodes via a simple transaction. Despite the minor impact on the network, the discovery emphasizes the crucial nature of updating to the latest software versions for enhanced security. The authors advocate for transparency and timely disclosure of such vulnerabilities, adhering to scheduled public disclosures unless there are compelling reasons for delay, highlighting the importance of trust in software and its release processes.\n\nLastly, ajtowns discusses the integration of Plotly.js into a Discourse theme component, significantly enhancing data visualization capabilities within forums and discussion platforms. This development allows for the creation of interactive and complex graphs, such as XY plots and geographical data representations, directly within posts using simple text markup. The discourse component, which utilizes Plotly.js, is detailed in a guide available on GitHub, facilitating rich data representation and interaction for users. This advancement underscores the potential of integrating sophisticated graphing tools in user-generated content, as further explored in Plotly's comprehensive documentation at [Plotly's official website](https://plotly.com/javascript/).",
