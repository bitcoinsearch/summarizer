    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Antoine Riard discusses the necessity of updating pool software to mitigate the timewarp attack on the Bitcoin network by introducing a new consensus rule. This rule requires the timestamp for each block at heights divisible by 2016 to be no less than 600 seconds earlier than the previous block's timestamp, a measure aimed at preventing block orphaning due to time discrepancies. Despite its implementation in Bitcoin Core's testnet4, broader adoption across mining software remains limited, prompting calls for more documentation and guidance, especially for compatibility with Stratum V2 ([Stratum V2 specification document](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/07-Template-Distribution-Protocol.md)).\n\n1440000bytes presents an innovative soft fork activation method within the Bitcoin network that deviates from BIP 8 and BIP 9, utilizing `nLockTime` signaling combined with a flag day activation. This community-centric approach aims to assess support for soft forks through transaction signals, culminating in a consensual activation on a predetermined date, thereby addressing divisiveness observed in previous mechanisms. Detailed implementations for this process and its execution are provided to facilitate smoother protocol upgrades ([activation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/ab91bf39b7c11e9c86bb2043c24f0f377f1cf514.diff), [exclusion in relay or mining](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/commit/18cd7b0ef6eaeacd06678c6d192b6cacc9d7eee5.diff)).\n\nsCrypt-ts introduces an enhancement to Bitcoin's covenant mechanism by leveraging OP_CAT with the Schnorr signature scheme, aiming to improve the efficiency of signature computations and address the challenges posed by Bitcoin Script's limitations in integer operations. This advancement facilitates a more effective process for transaction grinding, especially in scenarios with multiple inputs, by extending the modification range of the least significant byte, as detailed in their [Github commit](https://github.com/sCrypt-Inc/cat-contracts/commit/3f48ae33da08046a3c2121083031ef523dd7aef9).\n\nIn an effort to improve community engagement and content quality, ajtowns reports an update to forum moderation flags, expanding the \"inappropriate\" flag to \"not constructive\" to encompass a wider range of non-productive behaviors. This change, along with the addition of warnings against",
