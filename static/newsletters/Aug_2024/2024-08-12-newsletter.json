    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Cory Fields highlights the ambitious project led by Hennadii Stepanov to transition Bitcoin Core's build system from Autotools to CMake, aiming to modernize and streamline development. This effort, set to integrate into the master branch after the v28 feature-freeze, underscores a shift towards a more efficient build process while continuing support for Autotools in older branches. The [CMake migration](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30454) represents a significant step forward in Bitcoin Core's development, emphasizing the importance of community feedback and collaboration for a smooth transition.\n\nAmin Bashiri and Majid Khabbazian's paper, presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2024 conference, addresses the denial-of-service threats in Onion Messaging with proposed mitigation strategies. Their research introduces innovative concepts like the \"Hard Leash\" and \"Soft Leash\" approaches to limit message hops and requires proof-of-work for additional hops, aiming to enhance the security of the Lightning Network. These propositions, alongside recommendations for rate limiting and routing based on channel capacities, offer promising avenues for protecting against DoS attacks. The complete paper is available at [FC'24 Preproceedings](https://fc24.ifca.ai/preproceedings/104.pdf).\n\nThe discussion by Murch explores Zawy's Alternating Timestamp Attack on Bitcoin Testnet 4, detailing a sophisticated manipulation strategy that could destabilize the network by altering difficulty adjustments through controlled block timestamps. This attack method, different from the known Timewarp Attack, poses significant risks including the invalidation of transactions and reorganization of blocks. A proposed softfork aiming to enforce consistent timestamp increases across difficulty periods is suggested as a countermeasure to such vulnerabilities, highlighting the critical need for ongoing security enhancements in blockchain technology. Further insights into this discussion can be found at [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/zawy-s-alternating-timestamp-attack/1062).",
