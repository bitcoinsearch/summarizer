    "summary_of_threads_started_this_week": "Sjors Provoost introduced Testnet 4 in BIP94, supported by Bitcoin Core version 28, aimed at addressing the impracticality of Testnet3, while preserving backward compatibility for users who choose to remain with the older testnet. This development reflects the Bitcoin community's commitment to enhancing testing environments for developers and exploring innovative approaches like a proof-of-work signet to improve network functionality ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/C899E966-6444-41EC-B977-96CFFCBF936A@sprovoost.nl/T/#m3c7b2c859613fc8c66511c5012274855f2b92f7c)).\n\nMartin Habov\u0161tiak discussed the security of hashed keys against quantum computing threats, proposing a Quantum Resistant (QR) signing mechanism that allows for secure transactions even after quantum computers become viable. This approach, which includes a method to secure bitcoin through QR scripts, highlights the ongoing efforts to enhance Bitcoin's security in anticipation of future quantum computing advancements ([source](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALkkCJY=dv6cZ_HoUNQybF4-byGOjME3Jt2DRr20yZqMmdJUnQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#m5c0e99289f1ada916372eb653f7c769864aca3a9)).\n\nThe Lightning Network Daemon (LND) version 0.18.0 introduced a revised sweeper subsystem that improves transaction batching and fee bumping by incorporating HTLC deadlines and budget considerations. This advancement supports more dynamic and efficient fee adjustments, enhancing security and reducing risks associated with missed deadlines or inadequate fee payments, marking a significant step forward in managing on-chain transactions for the Lightning Network ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/lnds-deadline-aware-budget-sweeper/1512)).\n\nJosh proposed a cross-input scripting capability for Bitcoin, enhancing transaction functionality by allowing additional spending criteria commitments at the time of signing. This proposal, seeking feedback for a potential soft fork, could significantly expand Bitcoin's programmability and transaction capabilities, underscoring the community's role in guiding the future of Bitcoin's scripting capabilities ([source](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-signature-cross-input-scripting-using-the-taproot-annex/1520)).",
