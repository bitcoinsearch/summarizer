What is the gold standard for storing crypto for non-technical people? Is a hardware wallet good enough? If my crypto has been on my hardware wallet for a year now is it more or less likely to be hacked over time?\"}, {\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"text\":\"A - Here\u2019s the thing. Different audiences, different groups of people are going to have different risk models and they are also going to have different tolerance for technical complexity. The important thing to realize here is that technical complexity is part of the risk model. Meaning that if what you are trying to do with security is more technically complex than your level of skill you introduce a very serious risk, that you will lose your crypto. Not because it is stolen but because your ambition for technical excellence exceeded your skill level for technical execution and you frankly messed it up. This applies to every level of technical expertise. There is always a higher level of security you can achieve by adding a bit more complexity. Security is not an on, off thing. It is not \u201cIt is secure\u201d or \u201cIt is not secure.\u201d There is no gold standard for security that applies for everyone. There is a sweet spot where the risks that you face from external factors, from the adversarial model that you have identified where you understand who might be after your crypto and under what circumstances they might access it. The risk model you have for resilient long term storage and also you should be thinking about inheritance and how your loved ones will deal with this is if something happens to you. The risk model you have for simple loss which includes a fire, a flood, an environmental disaster, a problem with your home or the other areas where you store keys, termites that eat through your paper backups or whatever else the risk model might be. Then you balance against your technical skill and you find which of these risks you can eliminate in a way that both you and the people you will designate as helping your loved ones recover your crypto if something happens to you can execute that technical plan flawlessly. That\u2019s the sweet spot. Trace\u2019s sweet spot is Bitcoin Core for network validation, Armory for managing private keys, Glacier protocol for standard operating procedures, Purism laptop for hardware. Other people have a higher sweet spot. For example for Coinbase\u2019s cold storage they use a Faraday cage. They have a room that is lined with an electromagnetic shield so it won\u2019t leak RF. Other people use nothing. There is a range here. What Trace is doing is identifying his sweet spot based on his level of technical expertise and the people around him that he has able to assist him and others if the need comes. He is also balancing this against his lifestyle and where he lives, what access he has to secure locations to store his keys etc. None of this is going to be same for you. You have to figure out what is right for you. For 99 percent of users this is not right. The reason it is not right is because 99 percent of users of crypto do not have the technical expertise to execute on a plan of this complexity. As a result what they will do is they will overextend and underachieve on technical execution. They stand a much bigger risk of losing crypto because of key loss than having crypto stolen because of an external adversary. Your own lack of technical expertise and your overambition in execution is going to cause you to lose your crypto, not some nefarious hacker. Having said that, what can you do that is practical? If you have your crypto on a hardware wallet that is a fairly high level of security. The important question then comes where is that hardware wallet backed up? Where are those backups stored? How are those backups stored? And do you have additional layers of security? For example, if you have a hardware wallet with a PIN then the hardware device itself is somewhat secure but it is still vulnerable to physical attacks. Meaning you have to secure the physical location where you have that hardware wallet. A wall safe, floor safe or even a hidden compartment where you can hide your hardware wallet is often enough security if people don\u2019t know that you have crypto. If people know that you have crypto and they know where you live then you have a slightly higher degree of risk and you need to account for that. Now about the backups. Writing 24 English words on a piece of paper with your own handwriting is probably the most resilient way you can backup your hardware wallet. You have to protect that seed. Most people are very worried that someone is going to break in, identify what the 24 words are and steal their money. That is not the biggest risk. The biggest risk is you lose it, you forget where you put it, you didn\u2019t do the backup in the first place, it got moisture, that is going to be a real problem. Paper gets wet and it gets destroyed, the ink bleeds, whatever. Or you had a fire, termites or some other natural disaster that destroyed your only backup. You can protect against many of these risks. Step one, create another layer of protection. Make a passphrase on top of the seed so that you have this additional layer of security. You still need to backup your passphrase because if you pass or are involved in an accident and you are the only one who knows the passphrase then that is a point of failure, your crypto is lost. It would be very difficult to brute force. A simple 4-6 word, random English word passphrase is sufficient if you physically protect your seed from disclosure. I would also add important measures. Make two or more copies of your seed and store them in geographically distant locations. The seed on its own without the passphrase is not sufficient to break it. Take that paper seed and laminate it so that it is protected from moisture which is the number one risk. Then put it in a tamper evident sealed envelope. You can buy these by the hundreds from retailers. They are often used for cash donations in religious institutions and things like that. This will allow you to ensure with easy inspection whether anyone has peeked at your seed. And give you piece of mind that no one has accessed that particular copy of the seed. Create more than two copies of it. Put it in a standard fireproof safe that can resist a fire and put two copies in two different locations that are unlikely to burn down at the same time. With these measures in place you have protected yourself from the biggest risks which are accidental damage, environmental damage and loss due to insufficient backups. You have to also backup those 4-6 word passphrases. Write those down on paper, laminate those, put them in a tamper evident envelope, store 2 or more copies in 2 or more different locations from where their seeds are. Finally write a letter so that people know that these things exist. Coordinate with your family so that they know that these things exist but they can\u2019t easily access them and take away your crypto. For most people the simple Stone Age technology of paper, pencil with a little modern addition of a laminated sheet so you don\u2019t get moisture damage and a simple cheap, plastic envelope that makes it obvious if someone has peeked at your seed is sufficient. You don\u2019t need to go to the extremes and the technical complexity of Glacier protocol. Here\u2019s the problem. When people give advice like this, when they say that if you don\u2019t achieve this level of \u201cI feel confident\u201d you are not secure, what they are doing is not encouraging people to achieve better security. They are either pushing people to try to overextend their technical skill and making them at risk of losing their crypto due to a variety of technical problems or they are pushing people to go to custodial exchanges. The vast majority of people having read things like the Glacier protocol will go \u201c I don\u2019t even know.\u201d They will either try to do it without understanding it fully, be very uncomfortable with their knowledge and probably lose their crypto because they messed it up or they are just going to give up on the first page and move their crypto into custodial storage and let someone else take care of the security. We have an intermediate level that people can use. Hardware wallets with paper backups, properly secured with a passphrase, are very effective, they are easy to do for most people and if you follow instructions\u2026. Don\u2019t try to improvise. Don\u2019t try to do things like cutting up your seed into groups of words and sprinkling them in different locations. Don\u2019t try to use overly complex passphrases or take the words, put them in a file, encrypt that file with PGP, store it on Dropbox\u2026. None of that. Old fashioned, low tech, paper, pencil, protection from water, protection from fire, multiple redundant copies, second factor passphrase. That is achievable by most people. Mike, your crypto is fine on the hardware wallet. It won\u2019t get hacked. It is not more likely to be hacked now than it was anytime in the past. 99 percent of the attacks you see against hardware wallets, you read about in academic papers or you see at academic security conferences, require physical access to the device. And even then they don\u2019t work if you\u2019ve updated your firmware correctly. More importantly the biggest risk you face is losing your crypto because you didn\u2019t properly backup your hardware wallet or because you tried to follow a set of instructions that started with \u201cObtain the unobtainium Linux distribution and install on an airgapped Faraday protected supercomputer in an underground bunker\u201d and you went \u201cHands up\u201d and put your money on Coinbase.\"}",

    "summary": "In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency security, Andreas Antonopoulos sheds light on the complexities and misconceptions surrounding the safest methods for storing digital assets. With a focus on practicality over perfection, Antonopoulos emphasizes the importance of aligning security measures with individual technical expertise to avoid the pitfalls of overreaching one's capabilities.\n\nThe notion of a \"gold standard\" for crypto security is debunked by Antonopoulos, who argues that such a concept fails to account for the varied risk models and technical proficiencies of cryptocurrency users. Instead, he advocates for a balanced approach, where the level of security implemented is directly proportional to the user's understanding and ability to execute technical procedures without error. This perspective challenges the high-security protocols endorsed by figures like Trace Mayer, suggesting they may only be suitable for a small fraction of users with the necessary skills and resources.\n\nAntonopoulos points out that the majority of crypto holders are at greater risk of losing their assets through self-inflicted errors than from external threats. The pursuit of overly complex security measures can lead to critical mistakes, resulting in the loss of digital assets. He stresses the significance of recognizing one's limitations and opting for security solutions that are manageable.\n\nFor most individuals, hardware wallets present a viable and secure option for storing cryptocurrencies. These devices offer a significant layer of protection, especially when complemented with proper backup procedures. Antonopoulos underscores the importance of safeguarding the physical hardware wallet and its backups against potential threats, including environmental damage and unauthorized access. \n\nHe proposes straightforward, yet effective strategies for backing up wallet seeds, such as using paper and pencil, adding an extra layer of security with a passphrase, and creating multiple copies stored in separate locations. These measures enhance resilience against a range of risks while remaining accessible to the average user. Laminating paper backups and enclosing them in tamper-evident envelopes further protects against moisture and unauthorized viewing, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, Andreas Antonopoulos advocates for a realistic and achievable approach to cryptocurrency security, tailored to the individual's technical skill level and unique risk factors. By simplifying the backup process and avoiding unnecessary complexity, users can effectively secure their digital assets without succumbing to the fear of hacking or the lure of custodial solutions. This pragmatic advice encourages the adoption of security practices that safeguard cryptocurrencies against both external threats and human error, ensuring peace of mind for the broad spectrum of crypto users."
