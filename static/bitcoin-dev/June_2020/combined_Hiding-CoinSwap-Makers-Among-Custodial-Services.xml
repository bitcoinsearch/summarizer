    <summary>In a recent email exchange, ZmnSCPxj and Chris discuss the potential benefits of using batching in CoinSwap operations. By slowing down the process, CoinSwappers can pretend to be a service provider and improve privacy. This would also allow makers to use batching and potentially save on fees. However, ZmnSCPxj later realizes that the same kind of batching can also be done by the taker. By contacting two makers in parallel, each CoinSwap operation would look like an ordinary pay-to-someone-and-get-back-change transaction. This method could potentially provide extra privacy and reduced cost for the taker, but its effectiveness is uncertain.The conversation between ZmnSCPxj and Chris revolves around the idea of CoinSwappers slowing down the CoinSwap process to enable makers to use batching. This strategy not only improves privacy by pretending to be a service provider using batching but also offers practical benefits for CoinSwap takers who want greater privacy. By being willing to wait longer, takers can save on miner fees as well.The email exchange briefly discusses the idea of CoinSwappers slowing down the CoinSwap process to allow makers to utilize batching. It seems that CoinSwappers act as intermediaries in the CoinSwap process. Slowing down the process gives makers more time to batch their transactions and potentially save on fees. The email exchange acknowledges that there are important links provided in the email to provide more context for those unfamiliar with the terms used. CoinSwap refers to a specific type of transaction that allows users to swap cryptocurrencies without revealing their identities, while batching is a technique that combines multiple transactions into a single one to save on network fees.ZmnSCPxj, a Bitcoin developer, proposes a technique to enhance CoinSwap user privacy. The approach involves makers operating in rounds and using transaction batching to serve multiple clients with a single transaction. This not only addresses blockchain size issues but also incentivizes makers to adopt the technique by reducing their overall transaction costs. By spreading taint and increasing the effort required for chain analysis, this method can slow down the CoinSwap process and enable makers to utilize batching for improved user privacy.In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, ZmnSCPxj suggests a method to enhance the privacy of SwapMarket customers. This proposal entails makers operating in rounds and using batching to combine multiple client transactions into a single one. By doing so, makers can mitigate blockchain size issues associated with CoinSwap. Although this increases the effort required for chain analysis and spreads taint, makers are incentivized to adopt this technique due to reduced transaction costs and increased profitability.</summary>
