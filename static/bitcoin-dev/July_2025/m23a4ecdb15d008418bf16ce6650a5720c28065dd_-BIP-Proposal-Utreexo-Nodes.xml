    <summary>In the process of conceptual analysis, a detail pertaining to the validation aspect in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was identified as missing. To address this, it's highlighted that the necessary information is contained within a specific section of the validation BIP, which is dedicated to covering the order of operations. This can be found in detail at [this link](https://github.com/utreexo/biptreexo/blob/main/utreexo-validation-bip.mdorder-of-operations). The intention behind keeping the accumulator BIP devoid of Bitcoin-related operations was explicitly mentioned, with an emphasis on segregating validation of Bitcoin blocks into its own separate BIP. This strategy ensures clarity and focus within the BIPs, with each addressing distinct aspects of the system without overlapping functionalities.</summary>
