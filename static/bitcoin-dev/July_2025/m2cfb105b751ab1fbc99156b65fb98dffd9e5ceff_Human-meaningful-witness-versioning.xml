    <summary>In a recent discussion among programmers on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a consensus was reached regarding the use of Witness Version 2 for BIP-360. This decision highlights the collaborative nature of development within the Bitcoin community, where proposals are discussed openly and decisions are made collectively. The inquiry about the rationale behind BIP-0173's introduction of a special rule for making Witness Versions legible reflects a deeper interest in understanding past decisions to inform future developments. Such discussions are crucial for maintaining a transparent and informed development process, ensuring that changes are well-considered and documented for posterity. The conversation underscores the importance of historical context in evolving technological standards, suggesting that a thorough documentation of reasoning behind key decisions could be beneficial for ongoing and future protocol enhancements.</summary>
