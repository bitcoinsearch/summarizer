    <summary>The conversation around the feasibility of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has shifted dramatically in recent times. With significant scientific and engineering advancements, the skepticism surrounding CRQCs has largely dissipated. The consensus within both quantum and cyber communities now leans towards the inevitable arrival of CRQCs. This shift in perspective is reflected not just in academic circles but also in practical, regulatory, and financial actions worldwide. Governments and regulators are rolling out quantum readiness roadmaps, financial institutions such as banks are initiating their preparatory programs, insurers are identifying and carving out quantum risks, and there's an increasing trend of quantum readiness questions during earnings calls by shareholders and analysts. This surge in activity is matched by a growing public awareness and media interest, signaling a broad recognition of the impending quantum era.

This heightened awareness brings to the fore the necessity for the Bitcoin community to address the quantum threat proactively. The public's expectation for clear assurances or plans regarding Bitcoin's resilience against quantum attacks is growing. Ignoring these concerns or dismissing the potential of CRQCs could significantly undermine confidence in Bitcoin. In response, the proposition of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) tailored to enhance Bitcoin’s defense against quantum threats is gaining traction. Together with BIP-360, a structured plan is emerging to fortify Bitcoin's infrastructure against quantum vulnerabilities.

The discourse on enhancing Bitcoin's quantum resistance includes several critical discussions. Firstly, addressing the technical aspects of safeguarding BIP-39 wallets from post-quantum threats, which is seen as a relatively straightforward challenge. Secondly, the need for increasing crypto-agility within Bitcoin’s architecture to swiftly adapt to quantum advancements. Thirdly, a more philosophical debate centers on the approach towards legacy non-Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets - whether to render them obsolete or allow them to be compromised in the wake of quantum computing. These discussions underscore the complexity and multifaceted nature of preparing Bitcoin for a post-quantum world, highlighting the urgent need for strategic planning and action within the community.</summary>
