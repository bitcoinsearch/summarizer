    <summary>The discourse surrounding the evolution and the impending reality of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has shifted markedly within the past year. With significant advances in science and engineering, the debate over their feasibility has largely been settled among experts in the quantum and cyber fields. The focus has now moved beyond mere speculation to preparation and action across various sectors. Governments and regulatory bodies are developing quantum readiness roadmaps, financial institutions like banks are initiating programs to address potential quantum vulnerabilities, and insurers are identifying quantum-related risks. This proactive stance is fueled by increasing scrutiny from shareholders and analysts during earnings calls, along with a growing media spotlight on the subject. Consequently, there is a burgeoning public awareness and expectation for clear strategies to mitigate the quantum threat, especially concerning technologies like bitcoin.

The urgency of addressing this issue is underscored by the proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), which aim to fortify bitcoin against quantum threats. These include BIP-360 among others, signaling a comprehensive plan to enhance bitcoin's quantum resistance. The strategy encompasses several key initiatives. Firstly, there's a technical solution in sight for Phase C, focusing on Post-Quantum Legacy Recovery for BIP-39 wallets, which represents a relatively straightforward challenge. Secondly, the need to increase cryptographic agility within bitcoinâ€™s infrastructure is acknowledged as a critical step forward. Finally, a more philosophical debate looms regarding the treatment of legacy non-HD wallets, with options ranging from their complete eradication to allowing them to be potentially compromised or "liberated."

These discussions highlight the community's shift from skepticism to proactive planning in response to the quantum computing horizon. The emphasis is on ensuring bitcoin's resilience in a future where quantum computing capabilities could pose significant security challenges.</summary>
