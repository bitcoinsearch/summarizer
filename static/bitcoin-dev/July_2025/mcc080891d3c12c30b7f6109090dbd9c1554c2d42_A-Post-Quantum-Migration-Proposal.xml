    <summary>The discourse around the feasibility of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has shifted significantly over the past year, with recent advancements in science and engineering making their eventual arrival a consensus among quantum and cyber communities. As various sectors, including regulators, governments, banks, insurers, and analysts, begin to prepare for the impact of quantum computing, there is a growing public expectation for assurances against the quantum threat, especially concerning bitcoin's security.

A proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is gaining traction as part of a broader plan to address these concerns. This plan includes efforts to ensure bitcoin's resistance to quantum computing threats, highlighting the general movement towards quantum readiness across different sectors. The proposal outlines a multi-faceted approach to enhance bitcoin's security in the face of potential quantum computing challenges.

The strategy to counteract the quantum threat involves three distinct discussions. Firstly, there is a technical solution on the table for Phase C (Post-Quantum Legacy Recovery) specifically for BIP-39 wallets, which appears to be the most straightforward problem to solve. Secondly, the conversation turns towards making bitcoin more "crypto-agile" to adapt to future quantum-related challenges efficiently. Lastly, there is a philosophical debate regarding the treatment of legacy non-HD wallets, pondering whether they should be considered forfeit or allowed to be "stolen" or "liberated." This comprehensive approach underscores the need for the bitcoin community to adapt and prepare for the quantum computing era, reflecting a proactive stance in safeguarding digital assets against emerging technological threats.</summary>
