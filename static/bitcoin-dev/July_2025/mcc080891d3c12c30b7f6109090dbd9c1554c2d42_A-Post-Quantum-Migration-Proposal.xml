    <summary>The conversation around the feasibility of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has significantly shifted in recent times. Previously, there were doubts about their viability, but due to recent advancements in science and engineering, the consensus within quantum and cyber communities now firmly supports the inevitability of CRQCs. This shift in perspective is largely reflective of a broader change in attitude across various sectors. Regulatory bodies and governments are actively preparing for the quantum era by developing quantum readiness roadmaps. Similarly, financial institutions such as banks have initiated programs to address this future, while insurers are identifying and categorizing quantum-related risks. Moreover, the scrutiny from shareholders and analysts during earnings calls increasingly includes questions about quantum readiness, indicating a growing concern about the potential impact of quantum computing on current technologies.

The public's awareness and interest in quantum computing and its implications are also on the rise, fueled by extensive media coverage. This growing curiosity and concern have led to expectations for clear assurances or plans, particularly regarding how cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will navigate the threats posed by quantum computing. The lack of a robust response or the dismissal of these concerns could undermine confidence in digital currencies' security and viability in a post-quantum world.

In response to these developments, there's momentum building around specific Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that aim to address the challenges posed by CRQCs. The discussions have advanced to the point where a plan is being formulated, notably with proposals such as BIP-360, which outlines steps towards enhancing bitcoin's resilience against quantum threats. The discourse has branched into three key areas: firstly, addressing the technical solutions for Post-Quantum Legacy Recovery, particularly for BIP-39 wallets, which is seen as a relatively straightforward challenge. Secondly, the conversation is exploring ways to make cryptographic practices more adaptable and agile in anticipation of quantum advancements. Finally, there is a philosophical debate on how to handle legacy non-HD wallets, weighing the options between allowing them to be compromised or effectively "burning" them to prevent unauthorized access.

These discussions underscore the critical need for the bitcoin community and other stakeholders to proactively engage with the evolving landscape of quantum computing. By doing so, they can ensure that digital assets remain secure and viable in the face of potentially disruptive technological advancements.</summary>
