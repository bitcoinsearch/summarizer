    <summary>The discourse on the inevitability of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has shifted dramatically over the past year, thanks to numerous scientific and engineering advancements. The consensus among the quantum and cyber communities is that the arrival of CRQCs is not a matter of if but when. This shift in perspective is mirrored by proactive measures across various sectors. Regulatory bodies and governments worldwide are drafting quantum readiness roadmaps, while financial institutions have initiated programs to address potential quantum threats. Insurers are also adjusting their policies to include quantum risks, and this heightened awareness is reflected in the scrutiny from shareholders and analysts during earnings calls. Media coverage has significantly contributed to increasing public awareness about quantum computing's implications.

Amidst this backdrop, there is a growing expectation for tangible assurances or strategies against quantum vulnerabilities, particularly concerning bitcoin. The skepticism held by some regarding the feasibility of CRQCs poses a risk to confidence in bitcoin's security against quantum threats. In response, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aims to address these concerns comprehensively alongside BIP-360, signaling the formation of a strategic plan.

This strategy encompasses several key discussions. Firstly, there is a technical consideration on how to implement Phase C, which focuses on Post-Quantum Legacy Recovery for any BIP-39 wallets affected. This aspect is deemed relatively straightforward. Secondly, the conversation shifts towards enhancing crypto-agility, aiming to make the system more adaptable to future quantum technological advances. Lastly, a more philosophical debate emerges regarding the treatment of legacy non-HD wallets, weighing the options between destroying them or allowing them to be "stolen" or "liberated". These discussions are crucial in shaping the future resilience of bitcoin against quantum computing threats, highlighting the community's commitment to addressing these challenges head-on.</summary>
