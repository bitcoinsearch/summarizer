    <summary>The discourse around the feasibility of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) has shifted significantly in recent times. The question of their eventual development is no longer speculative; it’s a matter of consensus among experts in quantum and cyber communities. This change in perspective is reflected in the proactive measures being adopted across various sectors. Regulatory bodies and governments are drafting quantum readiness roadmaps, financial institutions have initiated programs to address potential quantum computing threats, and insurance companies are identifying quantum-related risks. Furthermore, the increasing public awareness and media coverage on this topic underscore the urgency for preparedness against the quantum threat.

In the context of Bitcoin, there's a growing expectation for visible plans or assurances that address how the cryptocurrency can withstand quantum vulnerabilities. The skepticism of some regarding CRQCs poses a risk to confidence in Bitcoin’s security. In response, the proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), including BIP-360, outline a strategic approach to enhance Bitcoin's quantum resilience. These developments signify a collective effort to fortify Bitcoin against quantum computing threats.

The strategy encompasses several key areas requiring focused discussion. Firstly, there's a technical path to safeguarding BIP-39 wallets through what’s termed as Phase C (Post-Quantum Legacy Recovery), which appears to be a more straightforward challenge. Secondly, the need to increase Bitcoin’s cryptographic agility is identified as a crucial step towards enhancing its security framework. Lastly, a philosophical debate surrounds the treatment of legacy non-HD wallets, weighing the options between rendering them obsolete or exposing them to potential 'liberation' or theft. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a multifaceted effort to secure Bitcoin in a future where quantum computing capabilities are advanced.</summary>
