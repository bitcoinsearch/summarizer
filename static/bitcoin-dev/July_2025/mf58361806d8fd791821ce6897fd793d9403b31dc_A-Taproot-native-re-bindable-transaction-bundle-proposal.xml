    <summary>The recent correspondence from Antoine highlights several key points about the adoption of Taproot in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Firstly, it acknowledges the utilization of a 90-day moving average on the [0xb10c's website](https://0xb10c.me/) for tracking Taproot adoption trends. This statistical approach reveals a significant increase in the share of created outputs (by value), moving from 1.6% to 6.7% within a year. This growth, albeit slower than desired by many within the community, signals a positive trend towards embracing newer technological advancements within the Bitcoin network.

Antoine emphasizes the inevitable slowdown in technology adoption as Bitcoin continues to mature, a pattern observed in many technological ecosystems. Despite this, the past year's trend provides grounds for optimism regarding future adoption rates. The conversation also touches upon the strategic choice not to incentivize users of older versions of the Bitcoin scripting context by integrating new features into these legacy systems. Instead, there is a subtle encouragement for users to upgrade to Taproot, suggesting that such nudges toward adopting newer technologies are beneficial for the community and the ecosystem at large.

This perspective underscores a broader belief within the Bitcoin development community that advancing technological adoption, even through gentle encouragement rather than forceful incentives, is crucial for the ongoing health and evolution of the cryptocurrency.</summary>
