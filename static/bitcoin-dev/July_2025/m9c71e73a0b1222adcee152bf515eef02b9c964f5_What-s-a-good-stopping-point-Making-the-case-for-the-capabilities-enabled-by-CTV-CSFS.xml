    <summary>The discussion revolves around the BitVM/CTV concept, which highlights the potential utility of inspecting other inputs in applications that use connector outputs. Despite this potential, the BitVM scenario was only briefly touched upon without any substantial demonstration or detailed explanation. This lack of detail makes it challenging to evaluate the approach's advantages and disadvantages thoroughly. Additionally, the effectiveness and improvement BitVM could offer to Bitcoin users remain uncertain since it has not yet been implemented or gained significant traction.

Greg's response to the BitVM proposal earlier in the conversation reflects a skepticism towards its current value, suggesting that the concept does not yet warrant a significant shift in Bitcoin's expressivity. This perspective underlines the need for a more concrete demonstration of BitVM's practical applications and benefits before it can be considered a viable enhancement to the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
