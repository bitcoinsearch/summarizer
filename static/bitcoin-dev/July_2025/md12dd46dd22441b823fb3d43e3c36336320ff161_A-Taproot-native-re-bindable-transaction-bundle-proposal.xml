    <summary>In the ongoing discussion about Bitcoin's development, Antoine Poinsot highlights a significant perspective on the introduction of new features into Bitcoin's scripting system. The core of the argument is the preference for incorporating new features only into the latest version of the scripting system unless there's a substantial reason not to. This approach is rooted in an effort to maintain consistency within Bitcoin's evolution, especially following the last soft fork, which aimed at enhancing privacy and security concerning transaction outputs.

The last upgrade in Bitcoin introduced mechanisms that allow for the concealment of the receiver's spending conditions, making transactions using Tapscript indistinguishable at the time of reception. However, this came with the trade-off of slightly higher costs for Tapscript spends. There's a concern that adding new features to older output types could undermine these advancements by making those older types more appealing due to lower costs, despite their lack of privacy features. This would contradict the objectives set by the recent upgrades and compromise the consistency of the system's evolution towards greater security and privacy.

The debate extends to specific proposals such as making OP_TEMPLATEHASH and/or OP_CSFS available in P2WSH. Poinsot expresses openness to changing his stance on this matter, pending a compelling argument for the inclusion of these features in older versions of the scripting system. This discussion also ties into broader considerations of Bitcoin's adaptability and future-proofing, as evidenced by references to discussions around BIP360, which deals with making Bitcoin's protocol resistant to quantum computing threats. For further insights into the nuances of this debate, one can refer to the detailed discussion on [DelvingBitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/changes-to-bip-360-pay-to-quantum-resistant-hash-p2qrh/1811/11).

This dialogue underscores the delicate balance between innovation and consistency within Bitcoin's development community. It showcases the thoughtful consideration required to navigate the advancement of the cryptocurrency while prioritizing the security and privacy of its users.</summary>
