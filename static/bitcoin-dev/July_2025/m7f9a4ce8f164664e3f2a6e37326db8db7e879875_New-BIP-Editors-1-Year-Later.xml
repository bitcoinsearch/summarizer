    <title>New BIP Editors: 1 Year Later</title>

    <summary>In the past year, significant changes have occurred within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, particularly with the introduction of new BIP Editors. This move was initiated to enhance and streamline the BIP process, addressing concerns about its efficiency and responsiveness. The addition of five new BIP Editors in April of the previous year marked a pivotal moment for the BIP repository, which has since experienced an uptick in activity. This change has evidently borne fruit, as demonstrated by a comparative analysis of the BIP process's performance before and after the new editors were integrated.

Before the new BIP Editors joined, the statistics over a 15-month period showed that the editors had left 80 comments, merged 44 Pull Requests (PRs), closed 6 PRs, and assigned 4 BIP numbers. Following their inclusion, there was a dramatic increase in productivity over the same length of time: 1272 comments were left, 261 PRs were merged, 122 PRs were closed, and 22 BIP numbers were assigned. This surge in activity indicates not only a rejuvenation of the BIP process but also highlights the success of integrating new editors into the system.

However, this progress brings to light an uneven distribution of workload among the editors, with a few of them contributing to the majority of the work. This disparity raises questions about the commitment level of all current BIP Editors and whether some might be replaced by others more willing or able to dedicate their efforts to serving the community in this capacity. The situation suggests a need for a review of the BIP Editors' roles and contributions, potentially leading to adjustments in the editorial team to ensure the continued efficacy and improvement of the BIP process.</summary>
