    <summary>After years of dedicated development, the RGB project has reached a significant milestone with the stable release of its consensus layer, marked as RGB-I-0. This achievement comes after approximately 8 to 9 years of work, including 6 years under the leadership of Maxim Orlovsky. The release is built on the `rgb-core` rust crate version 0.12, with detailed version numbering information available in the [RGB-6 document](https://github.com/RGB-WG/RFC/blob/master/RGB-6.md). This release represents a crucial step in client-side validation technology, which deals with more complex change rules compared to those found in the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, changes that render previously valid transactions invalid (akin to a soft fork in blockchain terminology) are treated as backward-incompatible changes in the context of client-side validation, mimicking the effects of a hard fork.

The completion of the RGB protocol's consensus layer signifies the ossification of its functionality, limiting the scope for future modifications or upgrades. A noteworthy aspect of this development cycle was the integration of zk-STARK support, enhancing the protocol's functionality. This addition posed a considerable challenge and necessitated a comprehensive reevaluation and redesign of the virtual machine and computing environment utilized by RGB. The full details of the enhancements and features introduced with this consensus layer release are documented in the official release announcement, accessible [here](https://rgb.tech/blog/release-v0-12-consensus/).

The importance of this release extends beyond the mere technical achievements; it marks a pivotal moment for developers and contract issuers. With the consensus changes now stable, contracts become forward-compatible, allowing for their deployment on testnets and the Bitcoin mainnet with confidence in their ongoing validity. However, for the sake of security and consistency, it is recommended that any contracts created with pre-release versions of the software be re-issued. This development not only underscores the project's commitment to innovation and stability but also highlights the collaborative effort of the community over the years. Further releases focusing on the standard library and application-level library are anticipated in the coming weeks, reinforcing the foundational consensus changes that are critical for maintaining contract backward compatibility.</summary>
