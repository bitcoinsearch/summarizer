    <summary>James O'Beirne and Antoine Poinsot engaged in a discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, addressing the current state of support for different versions of SegWit within the Bitcoin ecosystem. O'Beirne highlighted the reluctance of certain hardware manufacturers, known for claiming to produce military-grade security devices, to adopt Schnorr signatures despite their potential to enhance security and privacy. These companies have not incorporated Schnorr signatures for over five years, leading to a lack of support for MuSig2 and script path spending. This absence is noted as detrimental to both privacy and the overall security framework, given Schnorr signatures' capacity to offer more efficient signature aggregation compared to ECDSA.

The conversation also touched upon the broader implications of such resistance to upgrading. The delay in adopting newer cryptographic standards like Schnorr signatures by significant players in the cryptocurrency hardware space suggests a wait-and-see approach. There's an anticipation that these companies may only invest the necessary resources to update their firmware once Schnorr signatures become widely adopted across multiple cryptocurrency chains, driven by increased trade volume and demand.

Furthermore, O'Beirne expressed concerns about the review process and the bottleneck it creates for adopting new proposals. He suggested that creating a "patch" for both the BIP text and implementation could be a pragmatic step forward. This would support v0 SegWit while acknowledging the advancements made by taproot (v1). However, he emphasized the importance of not coercing users into upgrading by continuing to support v0, advocating for a balanced approach to innovation and legacy support within the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
