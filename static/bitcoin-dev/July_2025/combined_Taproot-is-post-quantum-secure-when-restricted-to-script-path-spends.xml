    <summary>A recent publication in the Cryptology ePrint Archive titled "The Post-Quantum Security of Bitcoin's Taproot as a Commitment Scheme" ([link](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1307)) addresses the concerns regarding the quantum resilience of Bitcoin's Taproot, specifically when utilizing script-path spending. The paper elucidates that under the quantum random oracle model (QROM), assuming SHA256's robustness against quantum attacks, a quantum attacker would not be able to compromise a Taproot output to reveal an unexpected Merkle root. This conclusion is pivotal as it underlines the potential of Bitcoin to adapt its scripting language for post-quantum security through a suggested two-phase softfork upgrade path. Initially, this upgrade would incorporate post-quantum signatures into the Bitcoin scripting language, followed by a subsequent phase aimed at phasing out Schnorr and ECDSA signatures in favor of these new signatures before the widespread advent of quantum computing.

The research provides a quantitative analysis revealing that a quantum attacker would require at least 2^81 evaluations of SHA256 to successfully compromise a Taproot output with a 50% probability. This task necessitates a quantum capability far beyond current technological means, indicating that even though the security threshold established is below the ideal 2^128 level targeted for post-quantum cryptography, it remains adequate given the present computational power available within the Bitcoin network. The paper posits that the real threat to Taproot's security may not emerge from quantum computing but rather from advancements in classical computing techniques, which could potentially offer more immediate challenges.

In essence, the study argues that while quantum computing presents a theoretical risk to the integrity of script-path spends in Bitcoin's framework, the actual level of threat is currently minimal. The focus should instead be directed towards enhancing the network's defense against potential vulnerabilities exposed by classical computing advancements. This shift in perspective emphasizes the importance of ongoing vigilance and adaptation in safeguarding Bitcoin against both current and future threats, highlighting the necessity for the Bitcoin community to proactively implement measures that ensure its resilience against the evolving landscape of computational technology.</summary>
