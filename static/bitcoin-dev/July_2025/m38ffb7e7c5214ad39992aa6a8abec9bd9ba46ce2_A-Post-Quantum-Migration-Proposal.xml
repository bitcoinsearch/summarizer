    <summary>Antoine Riard raises concerns about integrating post-quantum (PQ) cryptography into the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), emphasizing the significant performance drawbacks compared to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). He argues that unless PQ cryptography is proven necessary, its adoption could introduce unnecessary risks. However, if the need for PQ cryptography becomes undeniable, failing to adopt it could pose an existential threat due to ECC's vulnerabilities. The current BIP does not plan for the activation of PQ cryptography, operating under the assumption that its necessity will be thoroughly evaluated and agreed upon within the community.

Riard suggests that the decision to activate PQ cryptography should only be made once there is a broad consensus recognizing the tangible threats posed by cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) beyond mere speculation or fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He highlights the importance of a proactive approach in identifying and transitioning to a secure PQ cryptographic scheme before quantum capabilities mature to a point where they pose a real danger. Specifically, he points out that any Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) not protected by an effective PQ cryptographic method would be vulnerable to both long and short-range quantum attacks, underscoring the urgency in future-proofing Bitcoin against evolving quantum threats.</summary>
