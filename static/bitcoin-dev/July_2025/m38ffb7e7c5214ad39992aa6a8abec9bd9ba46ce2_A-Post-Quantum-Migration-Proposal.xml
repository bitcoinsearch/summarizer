    <summary>Antoine Riard highlights the nuanced considerations around implementing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in relation to Bitcoin's existing cryptographic framework. The discourse opens with skepticism towards hastily integrating PQC due to its substantial performance trade-offs compared to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Riard posits that switching to PQC should only occur if deemed absolutely necessary, given the existential risks ECC could face in a quantum computing era. The conversation acknowledges the theoretical risks posed by cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs), yet it leans towards a conservative approach, suggesting that PQC activation is contingent upon a broad consensus within the community acknowledging the imminent threat of CRQCs. 

Riard further delineates a "quantum vulnerable UTXO" as any output susceptible to quantum attacks, whether at close or long range, essentially any UTXO not protected by an accepted PQC scheme. This definition underpins a larger dialogue on the need for proactive measures within the Bitcoin ecosystem to mitigate potential quantum threats, albeit without rushing into solutions that compromise current system efficiencies. The underlying consensus appears to be a call for readiness and adaptability in the face of evolving quantum capabilities, emphasizing the importance of community agreement before transitioning to PQC methodologies.</summary>
