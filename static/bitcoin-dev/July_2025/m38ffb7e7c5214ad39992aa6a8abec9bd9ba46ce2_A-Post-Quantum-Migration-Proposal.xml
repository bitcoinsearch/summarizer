    <summary>Antoine Riard discusses the considerations around integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), highlighting the performance trade-offs compared to existing elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). He points out that the shift towards PQC should only occur if it becomes an absolute necessity, due to the potential existential risks associated with continuing ECC usage in the face of quantum computing threats. Riard acknowledges that there are risks from Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs), but he also emphasizes a cautious approach to adopting PQC. He suggests that PQC should not be activated without widespread consensus on the quantum threat being real and imminent, hinting at the importance of timely and collective action within the ecosystem to adapt to this evolving threat landscape.

The message also touches on the vulnerability of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to quantum attacks, noting that any UTXO not protected by an effectively chosen PWC scheme is at risk. This implies a future where the security of Bitcoin's blockchain could hinge on the successful selection and implementation of PQC solutions to guard against both near and distant quantum threats. The discussion reflects a broader concern within the cryptocurrency development community about preparing for a quantum computing era, balancing between premature adoption of PQC and the need to ensure the long-term resilience of blockchain technologies against quantum vulnerabilities.</summary>
