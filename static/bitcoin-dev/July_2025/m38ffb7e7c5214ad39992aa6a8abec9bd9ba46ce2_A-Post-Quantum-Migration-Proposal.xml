    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the cautious approach towards integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into Bitcoin's infrastructure, highlighting the significant performance trade-offs compared to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The conversation acknowledges a scenario where PQC becomes essential, suggesting that continued reliance on ECC could then pose an existential threat. This perspective is rooted in the proposal's assumption that PQC's necessity arises from a broad consensus among stakeholders, rather than premature adoption driven by speculative fears about computational risks from quantum computers (CRQCs).

Further, there's an understanding that any transition towards PQC would only be considered after a widespread agreement within the community that the threat from CRQCs transcends theoretical concerns. This implies a future-oriented strategy where the activation of PQC mechanisms is contingent upon concrete evidence of quantum threats, ensuring that the ecosystem has sufficient time to adapt without compromising security.

Moreover, the concept of a "quantum vulnerable UTXO" is introduced, described as any unspent transaction output susceptible to both near and distant quantum attacks. This definition underscores the importance of adopting a secure PQC scheme when necessary, to protect against potential vulnerabilities exposed by quantum computing advancements. The narrative suggests a proactive yet measured approach to cryptographic evolution, emphasizing readiness over haste, and collective decision-making over unilateral actions.</summary>
