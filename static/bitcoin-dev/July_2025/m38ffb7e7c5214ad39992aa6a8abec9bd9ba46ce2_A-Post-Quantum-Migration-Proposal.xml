    <summary>Antoine Riard addresses the considerations surrounding post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and its implications for Bitcoin's security infrastructure. He argues that introducing PQC, which comes with significant performance trade-offs compared to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), might not be justifiable unless it becomes an absolute necessity. If the situation arises where ECC's vulnerabilities to quantum attacks pose an existential threat, then, and only then, would the shift towards PQC be warranted.

Riard suggests that the current proposal does not actively plan for the implementation of PQC but rather operates under the assumption that it will be necessary only if proven essential. This cautious approach stems from a desire to avoid premature commitment to PQC before there is a broad consensus regarding the imminent threat posed by quantum computing to current cryptographic standards, specifically related to Bitcoin. He mentions that the activation of PQC will likely be contingent on widespread agreement that quantum computing risks, often dismissed as fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), are indeed legitimate concerns.

Furthermore, Riard clarifies the definition of a quantum-vulnerable Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), highlighting any UTXO at risk from both proximate and distant quantum attacks as vulnerable. This distinction underscores the evolving nature of threats in the cryptocurrency landscape and the need for adaptability in securing assets against potential future quantum capabilities. The discussion points towards a cautious but prepared stance on transitioning to PQC, emphasizing the importance of consensus and timely action within the Bitcoin ecosystem to address quantum threats effectively.</summary>
