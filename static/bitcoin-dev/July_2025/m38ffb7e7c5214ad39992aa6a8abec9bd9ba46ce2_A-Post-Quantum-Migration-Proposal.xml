    <summary>Antoine Riard presents a critical viewpoint on the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), highlighting that its integration, which comes with significant performance drawbacks compared to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), should only be considered if absolutely necessary. The necessity arises from the potential existential threat ECC faces in the context of quantum computing advancements. The proposal explicitly states that it does not plan to enable PQ cryptography unless it is deemed essential for the network's survival.

Riard emphasizes the importance of consensus within the community before activating post-quantum cryptographic solutions, given the speculative nature surrounding the capabilities of quantum computers and their ability to break current cryptographic defenses (referred to as CRQCs - Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers). This approach suggests a careful and measured response to the evolving threat landscape, rather than a preemptive and possibly premature shift to post-quantum cryptography.

The discussion also touches on the vulnerabilities of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in a quantum-threatened environment. Any UTXO not protected by an effective post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) scheme would be at risk of both long and short-range attacks, underscoring the need for eventual migration to quantum-resistant algorithms to safeguard the integrity and security of the blockchain against future quantum capabilities.</summary>
