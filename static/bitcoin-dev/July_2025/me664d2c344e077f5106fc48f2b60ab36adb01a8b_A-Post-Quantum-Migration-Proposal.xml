    <summary>The recent discussion among Bitcoin developers has centered around a proactive approach to safeguarding Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats. A notable suggestion in this regard is the implementation of a multi-phased strategy aimed at temporarily locking vulnerable coins, thereby granting additional time to refine and deploy quantum-resistant cryptographic proofs, specifically zk-STARKs, during what is referred to as phase C. This approach not only accommodates the development timeline of quantum-proof systems but also offers flexibility by allowing for the possible integration of phases B and C, depending on the comparative progress of quantum computing advancements and the readiness of phase C solutions.

In addressing concerns related to the permanent blocking of transactions to pre-quantum addresses, it's proposed that instead of a permanent blockade, temporary restrictions should be applied. This method would support future recovery schemes without necessitating a hard fork, thus mitigating the risk of inadvertently confiscating funds through non-recoverable transactions, such as those intended for vulnerable addresses via presigned transactions like a Lightning force-close. The essence of this strategy lies in its dual focus: preventing quantum attacks while ensuring the possibility of future fund recovery by legitimate owners, striking a balance between security and accessibility.

The ethical implications of temporary blocking are explored, highlighting the varied impact on individuals with differing circumstances and risk appetites, such as heirs unable to access timelocked inheritances before the deadline. This underscores the complexity of implementing measures that affect users differently based on their unique situations and introduces a nuanced consideration of fairness and practicality in the face of theoretical quantum threats.

Further technical discussions delve into the treatment of BIP360 P2QRH addresses under the proposed phases, particularly the nuances of restricting EC spending from P2QRH UTXOs, which could lead to unintended locking of funds unless phase C unblocks them. The debate extends to the feasibility and security implications of restricting all EC spending across script types, advocating for a standardized approach to P2QRH address derivation that emphasizes the inclusion of at least one post-quantum spending path. By mandating a preceding PQ checksig opcode execution before any EC checksig opcode, the policy implicitly secures pre-quantum UTXOs until a specified future block height, while also facilitating flexible hybrid signature schemes within P2QRH scripts. This strategic framework aims to fortify Bitcoin against quantum vulnerabilities through a carefully sequenced deployment of technological and policy-based safeguards, ensuring both robust security and the preservation of user rights to fund recovery.</summary>
