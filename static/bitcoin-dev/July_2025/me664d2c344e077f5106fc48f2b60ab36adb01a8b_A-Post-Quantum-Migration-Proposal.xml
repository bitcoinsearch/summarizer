    <summary>In a recent discussion among Bitcoin developers, a novel proposal was introduced to address the vulnerability of certain coins to quantum attacks by implementing temporary locking mechanisms and adjusting the protocol in various phases. The idea revolves around temporarily locking vulnerable coins during a specific phase, dubbed phase B, until a future block height X is reached, which could be set anywhere from 5 to 10 years in the future. This approach would buy time for the development and tightening of the zk-STARK proof system planned for phase C while still offering protection against potential quantum threats. Additionally, this strategy allows for the flexibility of merging phases B and C into a single deployment should the development of quantum computing not progress as rapidly as anticipated or if the advancements in phase C outpace expectations.

The proposal also touches upon the ethical considerations and logistical challenges of permanently blocking transactions to vulnerable addresses. By opting for temporary restrictions rather than permanent ones, the proposal aims to leave room for future recovery schemes without the need for a hard fork, thus avoiding the risk of funds being irretrievably lost due to pre-signed transactions like Lightning force-closes being sent to now-blocked vulnerable addresses. This approach seeks to balance the protection of funds from quantum attacks with the ability for legitimate owners to recover their assets at a later date, attempting to strike a fair compromise between security concerns and the rights of coin holders.

Further, the conversation delves into the technical specifications and implications for Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 (BIP360) Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hash (P2QRH) addresses under these phased adjustments. A particular concern raised is whether phase B's stricter rules would inadvertently block Emergency Contact (EC) spends from P2QRH Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), potentially leading to scenarios where users might lock up their money until phase C unintentionally. To mitigate such risks, the discussion suggests that phase B could restrict all EC spending across script types, ensuring that users can reclaim their Bitcoin once phase C is implemented. For added security, it recommends that P2QRH addresses should avoid creating conditions that only include pre-quantum cryptographic signatures, advocating instead for the inclusion of at least one post-quantum signature path in their construction.

To practically implement these protections, a two-leaf construction for P2QRH addresses is proposed, consisting of one leaf with a standard EC signature opcode and another combining both EC and post-quantum signature opcodes. This setup would enable a flexible hybrid signature scheme that maximizes security by leveraging the combined strength of Schnorr and Dilithium cryptographic algorithms. Under this plan, nodes upgraded to support phase B would reject transactions that do not include the post-quantum signature opcode, thereby enforcing the temporary safeguarding measures until the ecosystem is ready to transition fully to post-quantum cryptography in phase C.</summary>
