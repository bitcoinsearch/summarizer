    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, contributors explored innovative strategies to enhance the security of Bitcoin transactions in anticipation of potential quantum computing threats. The conversation highlighted a multifaceted approach involving temporary restrictions on vulnerable coins and adjustments to transaction protocols to mitigate risks associated with quantum computing advancements.

One pivotal suggestion was the temporary locking of vulnerable coins during a specific phase, labeled as phase B, until a future block height X is reached, potentially spanning 5-10 years. This strategy aims to buy time for the development and refinement of the zk-STARK proof system planned for a later phase, phase C. The flexibility of this proposal lies in its allowance for the integration of phases B and C, should quantum computing progress at a slower pace than expected or if the development of phase C outpaces predictions. This integrated deployment would facilitate a smoother transition while safeguarding against quantum threats without necessitating a hard fork.

The dialogue also touched upon the implications of these phases for different types of Bitcoin addresses and transactions, particularly concerning P2QRH addresses which incorporate EC signature spending conditions. A critical aspect of the discussion was whether phase B's rules should extend to prohibit EC spending from P2QRH UTXOs, which could inadvertently lock funds until the activation of phase C. The consensus leaned towards a more inclusive restriction across all script types to uniformly protect against quantum vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of establishing addresses that include at least one post-quantum spending path.

It was proposed that phase B enforce a rule where any EC checksig opcode must be preceded by at least one post-quantum (PQ) checksig opcode within the script, effectively postponing the spendability of pre-quantum UTXOs until the designated future block height. For P2QRH addresses, a recommended structure involves a dual-leaf setup in the script: one leaf solely for an EC checksig opcode and another combining both an EC checksig and a PQ checksig opcode. This design ensures that, under phase B restrictions, only transactions meeting the hybrid condition would be validated, thereby marrying the security benefits of Schnorr signatures with those of the Dilithium algorithm.

This nuanced discussion underscores the Bitcoin community's proactive measures against emerging quantum threats, highlighting a thoughtful balance between immediate security enhancements and long-term access and usability of assets within the ecosystem.</summary>
