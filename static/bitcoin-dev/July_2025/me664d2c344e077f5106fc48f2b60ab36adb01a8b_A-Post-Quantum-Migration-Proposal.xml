    <summary>In a recent discourse within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, an innovative proposal was put forward regarding the handling of vulnerable coins in the face of potential quantum computing threats. The conversation opened with a suggestion to temporarily lock all susceptible coins during a specific phase, dubbed phase B, until a future block height X is reached, estimated to be in 5-10 years. This period would ostensibly allow for the refinement of the zk-STARK proof system planned for implementation in phase C, thereby providing a safeguard against imminent quantum attacks while avoiding permanent restrictions on these coins.

The flexibility of this approach was highlighted as a significant advantage, allowing for the possibility of merging phases B and C should the development of quantum-resistant technologies outpace the advancement of quantum computing, or vice versa. Such a merger could simplify the transition process for users and developers alike. However, concerns were raised regarding the permanence of blocking pre-quantum addresses, which, without the option of a hard fork, could lead to irreversible losses for some users. For instance, the scenario of a presigned transaction destined for a now-vulnerable address could result in the loss of funds unless temporary measures are adopted to enable future recoveries.

The ethical implications of this strategy were also deliberated, with particular emphasis on those unable to move their funds before the deadline, such as individuals with time-locked inheritances. The dilemma between risking loss to quantum decryption or enduring a temporary block with the hope of future access underscores the complexity of implementing a one-size-fits-all solution in a decentralized ecosystem.

Further technical considerations were discussed concerning BIP360 P2QRH addresses, which incorporate EC signature spending conditions. Questions arose about whether phase B's restrictions should extend to EC spends from P2QRH UTXOs, potentially leading to unintended consequences for users who inadvertently send funds to such addresses without realizing they would be locked until phase C. The conversation suggested that a uniform restriction on EC spending across all script types during phase B might offer a more coherent protection strategy, ensuring that all users have the opportunity to reclaim their Bitcoin once the quantum-resistant phase C is deployed.

To facilitate this transition, the development of standardized P2QRH address derivation methods and the provision of libraries for generating addresses with post-quantum spending paths were recommended. By encouraging the avoidance of creating P2QRH addresses without at least one quantum-resistant spending option, the community can mitigate the risks associated with quantum attacks. Additionally, the proposed enforcement mechanism for phase B – failing any EC checksig opcode unless preceded by a PQ checksig opcode – presents a technical pathway for integrating flexible hybrid signature schemes within the P2QRH tree, thereby marrying the security benefits of both pre-quantum and quantum-resistant cryptographic methods.</summary>
