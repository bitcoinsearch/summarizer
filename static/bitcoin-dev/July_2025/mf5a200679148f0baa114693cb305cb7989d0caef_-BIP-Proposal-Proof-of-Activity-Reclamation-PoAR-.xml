    <summary>The proposal, titled "Proof-of-Activity Reclamation (PoAR)," presented to the Bitcoin developers, focuses on addressing the economic implications of lost and abandoned Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). The author suggests implementing a rule-based, fully automated mechanism designed to recycle coins that have not been active for over 20 years. These coins would be reallocated to the undistributed pool and reintroduced into circulation through future block rewards. This process aims to extend miner incentives while ensuring adherence to Bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21 million BTC. The initiative seeks feedback from the community and encourages thoughts, suggestions, and critiques on the matter. For a detailed view of the proposal, it's available at [this link](https://gist.github.com/Brandchatz/56c39d289db9e56190c13922850815b8).</summary>
