    <summary>The proposal outlined seeks to address the quantum threat to Bitcoin by introducing a structured migration plan towards post-quantum (PQ) cryptography, without delving into the complexities of various post-quantum cryptographic schemes. It suggests a phased approach that incentivizes adoption and migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses after a consensus on the necessity for such a move is reached. The implementation hinges on the Post-Quantum Recovery Hash (P2QRH), as detailed in BIP-360 or future proposals, establishing a framework where failing to upgrade results in losing access to funds, thereby making quantum security a personal incentive.

Phase A of the proposal aims to disallow transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, promoting the use of P2QRH address types. Following this, Phase B would invalidate spends from ECDSA/Schnorr signatures, effectively freezing funds in quantum-vulnerable Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). An optional Phase C may introduce a mechanism for recovering legacy UTXOs through a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof of possession of BIP-39 seed phrases, pending further research and consensus within the community.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the imminent threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations. With advancements in quantum algorithms outpacing hardware improvements and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ratifying production-grade PQ signature schemes, the timeline for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer appears to be drawing closer, estimated between 2027 and 2030. This poses a significant risk to approximately 25% of all bitcoin whose public keys have been exposed on-chain, making them potential targets for quantum theft.

The urgency for migration is emphasized by the slow historical pace at which Bitcoin has adopted new code changes, necessitating a clear, time-boxed pathway to coordinate the ecosystem’s transition to quantum resistance. The proposal outlines benefits including enhanced resilience of the Bitcoin protocol, certainty for users and stakeholders about the network’s security, and supply discipline by rendering abandoned keys unspendable.

Stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, are presented with incentives to adopt the proposed changes. Miners would benefit from increased demand for block space and higher fees, while institutional holders and exchanges face fiduciary and bankruptcy risks, respectively, if proactive measures are not taken against quantum attacks. For everyday users, the sunset date offers a clear incentive for improving security, while attackers find their economic incentive diminishing as the sunset nears, given that stolen coins would become unspendable after Q-day.

This proposal underscores a defensive strategy, converting quantum security into a private incentive to upgrade and ensuring the Bitcoin ecosystem can effectively mitigate emerging threats. It is designed as a series of soft forks for backward compatibility, allowing older nodes to operate without modification but encouraging upgrades to fully validate new programs. Non-upgraded wallets will face restrictions on transactions as each phase is activated, culminating in a hard fork in Phase C to enable recovery of vulnerable funds via ZK proofs, if deemed necessary and supported by the community.</summary>
