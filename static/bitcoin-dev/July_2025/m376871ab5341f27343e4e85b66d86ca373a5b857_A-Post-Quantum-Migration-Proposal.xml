    <summary>The proposal presented addresses the urgent need for Bitcoin to adapt in response to the emerging threat posed by quantum computing. It introduces a structured approach to incentivize and ensure the migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses, without delving into the technical complexities of post-quantum cryptography itself. The essence of the proposal is the implementation of a post-quantum (PQ) output type, referred to as P2QRH, alongside a phased sunset plan for legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures. This approach aims to transform quantum security into a private incentive for users, presenting a clear ultimatum: fail to upgrade and lose access to funds.

The proposed timeline includes three phases designed to systematically phase out quantum-vulnerable addresses and signatures. Phase A prohibits transactions to these vulnerable addresses, promoting the adoption of P2QRH address types. Following this, Phase B invalidates all transactions from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs after a well-publicized flag day, occurring approximately five years post-activation. An optional Phase C may introduce a method for recovering legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, contingent on further research and consensus within the community.

This initiative stems from a recognition of the significant economic and security threats posed by quantum computing advancements. Notably, the ratification of three production-grade post-quantum signature schemes by NIST in 2024, combined with the accelerated pace of quantum algorithm improvements, highlights the shrinking safety envelope for classical encryption methods. The proposal underscores the vulnerability of Bitcoin due to exposed public keys, estimating that about 25% of all bitcoin could be at risk from quantum decryption efforts. Moreover, it acknowledges the challenges of coordinating widespread upgrades across wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians which historically have taken years, emphasizing the urgency of a proactive defense strategy.

The benefits of this proposal are multifaceted, offering resilience against quantum attacks, clarity and certainty for Bitcoin users and stakeholders through a publicized timeline, and discipline in Bitcoin's supply by rendering abandoned keys unspendable. It also outlines specific actions required from various stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, to migrate to upgraded, secure protocols. The overarching goal is to safeguard Bitcoin's integrity and value by preemptively addressing the quantum threat, thus maintaining trust and stability within the ecosystem.</summary>
