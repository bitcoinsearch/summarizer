    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The proposal under discussion introduces a structured approach to enhance Bitcoin's resistance against quantum computing threats, focusing on incentivizing the ecosystem's transition towards post-quantum cryptographic standards without delving into the specifics of post-quantum cryptography itself. It is anchored in the implementation of a new output type, P2QRH, as suggested in BIP-360, and outlines a phased plan to sunset legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures. This strategy is designed to turn quantum security from a theoretical concern into a tangible incentive for users to migrate their funds to quantum-resistant addresses, thereby bolstering the overall security of the Bitcoin network.

Phase A of the proposal mandates that funds can no longer be sent to quantum-vulnerable addresses, effectively pushing for the adoption of P2QRH address types. Following this, Phase B will see the invalidation of spends from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs by rejecting transactions based on ECDSA/Schnorr keys at a predetermined block height, approximately five years after the initial activation. An optional Phase C could introduce a method for recovering legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, contingent on further research and consensus within the community.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the imminent threat posed by advancements in quantum computing to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations. With significant progress in quantum algorithms and the potential for cryptographically relevant quantum computers emerging within the next decade, the urgency to preemptively address these risks is evident. The proposal aims to mitigate the economic and security implications of a successful quantum attack, which could compromise a substantial portion of Bitcoinâ€™s UTXO set, thus undermining confidence in the network.

Key benefits identified include maintaining the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol in the face of quantum advancements, providing certainty and clarity to stakeholders through a defined migration timeline, and enforcing supply discipline by rendering abandoned keys unspendable. The proposal emphasizes the necessity of a proactive defense mechanism, given the unpredictable motivations and capabilities of potential quantum attackers.

Stakeholders across the Bitcoin ecosystem, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, are encouraged to upgrade to mitigate the risks associated with quantum computing. Miners, for instance, would benefit from increased demand for block space and higher transaction fees, while institutional holders would fulfill their fiduciary duties by protecting their investments against quantum threats. Exchanges and custodians face concentrated risk, making early migration a cost-effective strategy against potential losses and reputational damage. For everyday users, the proposal offers peace of mind and a clear incentive to enhance their security practices ahead of the quantum threat.

In conclusion, this proposal represents a defensive strategy aimed at preserving the integrity and value of the Bitcoin ecosystem in the face of evolving quantum computing capabilities. By setting clear deadlines for migration and introducing incentives for stakeholders to upgrade, it seeks to ensure the long-term viability of Bitcoin as a secure and trustworthy digital currency.</summary>
