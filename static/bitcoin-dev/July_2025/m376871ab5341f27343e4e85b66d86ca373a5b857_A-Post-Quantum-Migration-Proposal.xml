    <summary>This blog post delves into a comprehensive proposal aimed at enhancing Bitcoin’s security in the face of the emerging threat posed by quantum computing. The proposal is a structured strategy to mitigate the risks associated with quantum attacks on the Bitcoin network, emphasizing the urgent need for the ecosystem to transition towards quantum-resistant cryptographic standards.

The foundation of the proposal rests on the implementation of a new post-quantum (PQ) output type, known as P2QRH, outlined in BIP-360 or potential future proposals. This initiative introduces a phased approach to incentivize the migration away from quantum-vulnerable cryptographic methods, specifically ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, which are integral to Bitcoin's current security model. The outlined phases include an initial disallowance of transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, followed by a complete invalidation of spending from these addresses, and concludes with an optional phase that could allow for the recovery of legacy UTXOs through zero-knowledge proofs.

The motivation behind this bold move is grounded in the increasing feasibility of quantum attacks on Bitcoin's cryptographic infrastructure. With the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ratifying three production-grade PQ signature schemes and predictions of cryptographically relevant quantum computers appearing potentially as early as 2027-2030, the urgency for preemptive measures has never been more pronounced. Notably, approximately 25% of all bitcoin have already exposed their public keys on-chain, rendering those UTXOs vulnerable to theft with sufficient quantum computing power. The proposal aims to minimize the potential incentives for quantum attacks by making it unfeasible for attackers to benefit economically from their efforts.

In addition to addressing the direct threat to Bitcoin’s security, the proposal seeks to streamline the upgrade process across the Bitcoin ecosystem. Historically, coordinating upgrades among wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians has been a lengthy process, fraught with inertia. By establishing a clear, time-bound plan for migration, the proposal endeavors to align the entire community towards a common goal, thereby facilitating a smoother transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.

The benefits of adopting this proposal extend beyond merely averting quantum attacks. It promises enhanced resilience of the Bitcoin protocol, ensuring its security well into the future. Moreover, by introducing certainty and clarity regarding the transition timeline, it aligns stakeholders across the spectrum, from miners to everyday users, towards a proactive defense against quantum threats. Importantly, the proposal also envisions a disciplined supply mechanism whereby un-migrated keys become unspendable, potentially reducing the overall supply as envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

In conclusion, this proposal represents a strategic, defensive stance against the potential existential threat posed by quantum computing. By turning quantum security into a private incentive for upgrading, it aligns the interests of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem towards safeguarding the network’s integrity and value. The proposed timelines and phases are designed to balance the need for urgent action with the practicalities of coordinating a distributed system’s evolution, ensuring Bitcoin remains secure, resilient, and trusted for generations to come.</summary>
