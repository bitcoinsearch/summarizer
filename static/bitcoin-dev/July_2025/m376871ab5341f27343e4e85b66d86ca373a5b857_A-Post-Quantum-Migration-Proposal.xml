    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The proposal focuses on the implementation of post-quantum (PQ) output types, specifically P2QRH, to address the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations. By introducing a pre-announced sunset of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures, the plan aims to incentivize the adoption and migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses before consensus is reached on the need for such action. This transition strategy consists of three phases: Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, encouraging the shift to P2QRH addresses; Phase B invalidates all transactions from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, effectively freezing those funds unless migrated prior; and an optional Phase C may introduce a method to recover legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge proofs contingent on further research and community demand.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the accelerated progress in quantum computing and its potential to compromise Bitcoin by calculating private keys from public ones. Notably, a significant portion of Bitcoin's UTXO set has already exposed public keys, making them susceptible to theft with sufficient quantum computational power. The unpredictability of a quantum attack, driven by diverse motivations, underscores the urgency of preemptive measures. Previous attempts at addressing this issue are deemed insufficient due to their potential to redistribute wealth unfairly or create security vulnerabilities.

Key benefits of the proposal include bolstering Bitcoin's resilience against future quantum threats without necessitating emergency measures, providing stakeholders with clear expectations for the security landscape, and aligning the ecosystem towards a unified timeline for adopting quantum-resistant technologies. Furthermore, the strategy encourages supply discipline by rendering unmigrated keys unspendable, echoing Satoshi's views on lost coins.

Stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, are incentivized to support the upgrade due to the direct and indirect benefits ranging from increased transaction fees and compliance with fiduciary duties to mitigating concentrated risks and enhancing personal security. Conversely, the proposal reduces the economic incentive for attackers by limiting the spendability of stolen coins post-upgrade. 

This defensive strategy, rather than an offensive one, aims to protect the Bitcoin ecosystem from quantum threats by turning quantum security into a private incentive for proactive upgrades. The phased approach seeks to balance the urgency of migration with the feasibility for account owners to comply, thereby maintaining the integrity of the Bitcoin network in the face of potential quantum attacks. Compatibility with older nodes is preserved through soft forks, emphasizing the importance of upgrading for full validation of new programs and ensuring the continued functionality of the network across different phases of the upgrade process.</summary>
