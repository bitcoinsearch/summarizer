    <summary>The proposal in discussion aims to address the existential threats posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin through a structured and incentivized migration plan, without delving into the complexities of post-quantum cryptography itself. It introduces a new output type, P2QRH, necessitating the pre-announced sunset of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures. This approach is designed to create a certainty of loss for those failing to upgrade, thus motivating the adoption of quantum-resistant addresses.

The implementation is divided into phases. Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, accelerating the transition to P2QRH addresses. Subsequently, Phase B invalidates all transactions from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, effectively freezing funds that have not been migrated. An optional Phase C could allow for the recovery of these funds through a zero-knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, pending further research and consensus.

This proposal stems from the urgent need to secure Bitcoinâ€™s value against quantum attacks, which pose unprecedented risks to the network's cryptographic foundations. Recent advancements indicate the potential emergence of cryptographically relevant quantum computers within the next decade, threatening to compromise about 25% of Bitcoin UTXOs that have exposed public keys on-chain. The proposed timeline and phased approach aim to mitigate these risks by minimizing the attack surface, ensuring the security of the UTXO set, and maintaining the network's integrity.

The benefits of this strategy include enhancing Bitcoin's resilience against quantum threats, providing clarity and certainty to users and stakeholders through a publicized migration timeline, and enforcing supply discipline by rendering abandoned keys unspendable. Each stakeholder group, from miners to everyday users, faces distinct incentives to upgrade, aligning interests across the ecosystem. 

This defensive strategy underscores the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding Bitcoin against future quantum attacks, emphasizing the need for a collective effort to migrate to quantum-resistant protocols. By setting clear deadlines and outlining specific actions required by various participants, the proposal seeks to facilitate a coordinated response to one of the most significant challenges facing Bitcoin today.</summary>
