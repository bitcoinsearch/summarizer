    <summary>The email discusses various approaches and challenges associated with integrating post-quantum cryptographic solutions into Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, notably through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) like Picnic signatures and zk-STARKs. The sender acknowledges Or's contribution to the discourse with a specific method that utilizes Picnic for proving knowledge of a BIP39 seed or a public key in a way that could enhance Bitcoin's resistance to quantum computing threats. However, they highlight significant hurdles in adopting these technologies directly due to the need for compatibility with existing systems and the avoidance of hard forks, which would be necessary for a complete replacement of EC signatures with Picnic signatures.

To address these concerns, the email suggests the possibility of soft-fork implementations that introduce new transaction data fields for carrying proof of seed derivation without disrupting the verification process by old clients. This approach maintains backward compatibility while enhancing security against quantum attacks. Yet, the discussion also covers the limitations and impracticalities associated with "Lifted FawkesCoin" and its commit/reveal protocol, noting the challenges in consensus rule changes, incentive structures for miners, and the overall complexity such protocols would introduce to the Bitcoin network.

The sender expresses skepticism about the feasibility of implementing complex protocols like FawkesCoin into Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, given the current debates and difficulties in achieving consensus within the community on simpler issues. They argue for a simpler, more elegant solution that aligns with existing consensus rules and can be seamlessly integrated into Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) and user experiences. The proposed solution involves requiring a proof-of-seed-knowledge to spend any EC-signature-locked UTXO, implemented as a soft fork, which, despite its potential drawbacks in terms of cost and throughput, is seen as preferable to the complexities and uncertainties of alternative proposals.

Finally, the email touches upon the choice between using Picnic signatures and zk-STARKs for this purpose, leaning towards zk-STARKs due to their versatility, performance characteristics, and the sender's familiarity with them. They call for further research and benchmarking to explore these options more thoroughly, emphasizing the potential of zk-STARKs not only for seed derivation proofs but also for other applications within Bitcoin and beyond. The sender appreciates Or's research and its value to the community, especially concerning post-quantum commit/reveal protocols, indicating a supportive yet cautious stance towards innovative cryptographic advancements in Bitcoin's development.</summary>
