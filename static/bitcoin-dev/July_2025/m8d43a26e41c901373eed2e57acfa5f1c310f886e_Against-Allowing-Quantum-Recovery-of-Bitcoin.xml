    <summary>The exploration of integrating zero-knowledge proofs, specifically through the use of Picnic and zk-STARKs, into Bitcoin transactions to enhance security in a post-quantum computing era presents a nuanced debate. The discussion centers on the potential for proving, in zero-knowledge, the knowledge of either a BIP39 seed that derives an EC secret key or a public key directly, without revealing the underlying values. This approach aligns with Or's paper, which suggests innovative methods but also acknowledges significant challenges in implementation without necessitating a hard fork of the Bitcoin network.

Implementing such cryptographic proofs would require substantial changes to how transactions are verified. Traditional EC signatures could not be replaced outright by Picnic signatures due to compatibility issues with old Bitcoin clients, necessitating a valid EC signature to verify transactions. A proposed solution involves a soft fork that introduces a new transaction data field for carrying the proof of seed derivation, allowing new clients to require this additional proof without alienating existing ones.

However, the concept of Lifted FawkesCoin, which includes commit/reveal protocols, faces critical obstacles in terms of consensus rule adjustments and miner incentives. It's suggested that enforcing these protocols could demand a hard fork, given the complexity of integrating such mechanisms smoothly within the current system. Moreover, the reliance on miners to not exploit the protocol for personal gain is seen as a significant risk, potentially undermining the integrity of the process.

The feasibility of adopting complex protocols such as FawkesCoin into Bitcoin's consensus rules is questioned, with the author arguing for simpler, more pragmatic solutions that align closely with existing frameworks. The suggestion is to focus on a proof-of-seed-knowledge requirement for spending transactions locked with an EC signature, achievable through a soft fork. This approach prioritizes ease of implementation and user comprehension over the introduction of extensive new protocols.

Finally, the choice between utilizing Seed-lifted Picnic signatures or zk-STARKs for this purpose remains open, with a call for further research to benchmark their effectiveness, especially concerning BIP39 seed derivation proofs. Although the author leans towards zk-STARKs due to familiarity and their general applicability, there's an acknowledgment of the need for quantitative analysis to make an informed decision. The conversation reflects an appreciation for the depth of research presented in Or's paper, highlighting it as a valuable resource for understanding post-quantum commit/reveal protocols despite the challenges in applying them to Bitcoin's consensus mechanism.</summary>
