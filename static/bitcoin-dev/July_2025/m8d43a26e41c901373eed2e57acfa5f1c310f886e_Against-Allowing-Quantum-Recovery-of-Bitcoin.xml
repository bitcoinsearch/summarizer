    <summary>The discussion revolves around the integration of zero-knowledge proofs, specifically using Picnic and zk-STARKs, into Bitcoin's protocol to protect against quantum computing threats. The initial approach considers leveraging these technologies for UTXOs, with two main scenarios: proving knowledge of a BIP39 seed that derives an EC secret key for UTXOs with exposed public keys, and proving knowledge of a public key directly for those UTXOs with still-secret public keys.

However, several challenges are identified with this approach, particularly the need for a hard fork to replace EC signatures with Picnic signatures fully. This is due to older Bitcoin clients requiring valid EC signatures, which would not be compatible with Picnic without exposing the EC public key â€“ a vulnerability in a quantum computing context. An alternative suggestion involves introducing a new transaction data field for proof-of-seed-derivation to achieve soft-fork backwards compatibility, allowing new clients to require this additional proof without breaking older clients' functionality.

Further complexities arise with the implementation of the "Lifted FawkesCoin" commit/reveal protocol, which would likely necessitate a hard fork due to its requirements that significantly diverge from current consensus rules. This includes the challenge of incentivizing miners to adopt new protocols that do not offer clear advantages over claiming pre-quantum UTXOs directly. While the "Restrictive FawkesCoin" proposal could potentially address some of these incentive issues, the overall consensus implementation complexity is deemed overwhelming, casting doubt on the feasibility of integrating such extensive changes into the Bitcoin protocol in the foreseeable future.

Given these considerations, the author advocates for a simpler solution aligned with existing consensus rules, suggesting the requirement of a proof-of-seed-knowledge for spending any EC-signature-locked UTXO through a soft fork. This approach avoids complex protocol modifications while ensuring upgradability for existing wallets without urgent migration needs.

The conversation concludes with a debate on the choice between Seed-lifted Picnic signatures and zk-STARKs for implementing the proposed proof-of-seed-knowledge. While the author admits a lack of familiarity with Picnic but extensive knowledge of zk-STARKs, they highlight the potential benefits of zk-STARKs in a post-quantum world due to their versatility and security features, despite their size and computational demands. The need for further research to compare these technologies, especially in the context of optimizing for BIP39/BIP32 derivation proofs, is underscored as a valuable step forward.</summary>
