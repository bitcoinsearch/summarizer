    <summary>MuHash, as discussed, presents a significant limitation due to its lack of a compact membership proof. This characteristic renders it less likely to be practical for applications that many might consider. Specifically, it finds its use within Bitcoin Core for the purpose of verifying the equivalency of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) sets in snapshots. The process to validate membership within this context requires iterating over the entire population, which could be seen as a drawback depending on the intended application.</summary>
