    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a discussion unfolded around the topic of version incrementation in relation to quantum-vulnerable address types. The conversation highlights a divergence in viewpoints regarding the adherence to established patterns of version incrementation versus the practical necessities that arise with the evolution of technology, specifically quantum computing. One participant underscored the importance of not deviating from existing patterns for version incrementation, despite the recognition of the need to make things more understandable for humans. This stance is rooted in the fact that quantum-vulnerable address types, such as P2WKH and P2WSH, have already adopted the `bc1q` prefix, suggesting a point of no return in the convention.

Moreover, the dialogue brought to light other critical considerations beyond versioning, touching upon the intricacies involved in naming new output types in the wake of quantum-resistant technologies. Suggestions for new naming conventions include P2QRH, P2TSH, and P2TTH, indicating a forward-looking approach to addressing the challenges posed by quantum computing. Additionally, there's an acknowledgment of the need for the development and definition of post-quantum signature verification opcodes, highlighting a proactive stance towards ensuring the security and resilience of cryptographic practices against quantum threats. This exchange underscores a broader dialogue within the Bitcoin development community on balancing tradition and innovation in the face of evolving technological landscapes.</summary>
