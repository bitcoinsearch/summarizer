    <summary>The discourse revolves around a novel proposal addressing the imminent threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin's security. The suggested strategy involves a phased approach to transition Bitcoin into a quantum-resistant state, ensuring its longevity and safeguarding against potential quantum attacks. This initiative is underscored by the increasing advancements in quantum computing, which pose a real threat to the cryptographic underpinnings of Bitcoin, potentially enabling attackers to steal vast amounts of bitcoin by deriving private keys from public ones.

The proposal is structured into three distinct phases: Phase A, Phase B, and an optional Phase C, each designed to incrementally enhance Bitcoin's resistance to quantum vulnerabilities. Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, thereby accelerating the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) output types like P2QRH, as described in BIP-360. Following this, Phase B aims to invalidate ECDSA/Schnorr spends, effectively freezing funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs to prevent theft. This phase is activated via a well-publicized flag day, roughly five years after the implementation of Phase A, providing a clear timeframe for stakeholders to upgrade their security protocols. Optionally, Phase C would allow for the recovery of these frozen funds through zero-knowledge proofs, specifically for users possessing a BIP-39 seed phrase, pending further research and consensus within the community.

The urgency of this proposal is highlighted by recent developments in quantum computing, including the ratification of three production-grade PQ signature schemes by NIST in 2024, and projections estimating the emergence of cryptographically relevant quantum computers as early as 2027-2030. These advancements significantly diminish the safety envelope for classical encryption methods currently employed by Bitcoin, rendering about 25% of all bitcoin—those whose public keys have been exposed—vulnerable to theft.

Critically, the proposed approach seeks to minimize the potential for economic disruption within the Bitcoin ecosystem by providing a clear, incentivized pathway for stakeholders to migrate to quantum-resistant technologies. By disallowing transactions to and from quantum-vulnerable outputs, the proposal not only reduces the attack surface but also hastens the adoption of new, secure script types. This preemptive measure is aimed at preserving the integrity and value of the Bitcoin network in the face of quantum threats, aligning with Satoshi Nakamoto's principle that "lost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more."

Furthermore, the proposal outlines specific actions required from various stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, to facilitate a smooth transition. Miners, for instance, are incentivized by the potential for increased transaction fees due to larger PQ signatures, while exchanges and custodians face concentrated risks from quantum hacks that could lead to catastrophic losses. Everyday users are motivated by the prospect of securing their assets against future quantum attacks, with the sunset date acting as a definitive deadline for improving their security measures.

In summary, the proposal offers a comprehensive and proactive strategy to fortify Bitcoin against quantum computing threats, emphasizing the need for timely action and collaboration across the Bitcoin ecosystem. It underscores the importance of private incentives for upgrading security protocols, aiming to maintain Bitcoin's viability as a secure digital currency in the quantum era.</summary>
