    <summary>In the midst of evolving quantum computing technology, a proposal has been put forward to address the vulnerability of Bitcoin against potential quantum attacks. The suggestion involves a structured approach to safeguard Bitcoin through a series of phases aimed at transitioning the network to a post-quantum secure state without necessitating a hard fork. This plan is divided into three main phases, each with specific actions and objectives designed to mitigate the risk posed by quantum computing advancements.

Phase A focuses on preventing any new transactions from being sent to quantum-vulnerable addresses, thereby accelerating the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) output types, specifically P2QRH as outlined in BIP-360. This phase acts as an immediate response to minimize future vulnerabilities by disallowing funds to be moved to at-risk addresses.

Following this, Phase B proposes the invalidation of ECDSA/Schnorr spends, rendering quantum-vulnerable UTXOs immovable. This phase would be activated approximately five years after its implementation, marked by a well-publicized flag day. It aims to provide a clear cutoff point, after which quantum-vulnerable coins cannot be spent, thus forcing holders to migrate their funds to secure addresses ahead of time. An interesting aspect of this phase is the temporary locking of vulnerable coins with a predefined block height at which they become spendable again, offering a window for the development of recovery mechanisms without permanently losing access to these funds.

Phase C, although optional, suggests the possibility of re-enabling the movement of these previously immobilized funds through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs). This would allow users to demonstrate ownership of the original seed phrases without exposing them, offering a quantum-resistant method to recover funds. This phase hinges on further research and consensus within the community.

The rationale behind this phased approach stems from the significant threat that quantum computing poses to Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations. With quantum computers potentially capable of breaking Bitcoin's encryption within the foreseeable future, this proposal seeks to proactively protect the network and its users from catastrophic loss. It highlights the urgency of migrating to quantum-resistant protocols to maintain Bitcoin’s integrity and security. The motivation for such a drastic change in protocol comes from a recognition of the slow pace at which upgrades are adopted across the distributed Bitcoin network, coupled with the increasing feasibility of quantum attacks.

This proposal also emphasizes the importance of incentivizing stakeholders to upgrade to post-quantum cryptography. By making it clear that failure to upgrade will result in inaccessible funds, the proposal creates a strong incentive for action. Miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users all stand to benefit from early migration to secure protocols, reducing the overall risk of a quantum attack on the network.

Overall, this structured approach to addressing the quantum threat showcases a strategic and thoughtful method for enhancing Bitcoin’s resilience against future technological advancements. It represents a defensive measure designed to secure the value of the UTXO set while minimizing incentives for quantum attacks, ensuring the long-term security and viability of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency.</summary>
