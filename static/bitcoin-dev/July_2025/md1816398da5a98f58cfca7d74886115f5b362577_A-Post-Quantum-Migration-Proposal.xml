    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, discussions revolved around a novel proposal to safeguard Bitcoin from potential quantum computing threats without necessitating a hard fork. The proposal outlines a phased approach to handle vulnerable coins, starting with prohibiting any new transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses (Phase A), rendering ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid to prevent spending from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs (Phase B), and optionally allowing the recovery of legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge Proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase (Phase C).

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the rapid advancements in quantum computing and its implications for Bitcoin's security. Notably, NIST has ratified three production-grade post-quantum signature schemes, indicating that cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge sooner than anticipated. This presents a unique and existential threat to Bitcoin, as roughly 25% of all bitcoins have already exposed their public keys on-chain, making them potential targets for quantum attacks. The proposal aims to minimize incentives for quantum attacks by securing the value of the UTXO set and reducing the attack surface through proactive measures.

One key aspect of the proposal is the introduction of post-quantum output types (P2QRH) following BIP-360 or future proposals, which would disincentivize sending funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses, thus hastening the adoption of these new address types. The well-publicized flag day for Phase B, set approximately five years after activation, would mark the transition to disallowing spends from quantum-vulnerable outputs, providing a clear timeline for stakeholders to upgrade their systems.

The proposal also considers the possibility of extending the deadline or employing soft forks to adjust to unforeseen developments in quantum computing or recovery mechanisms. This flexibility acknowledges the uncertainties surrounding the timeframe for practical quantum computers and the availability of effective recovery schemes.

Furthermore, the discussion highlights the need for a unified effort among developers, miners, and users to adopt and implement these changes. The proposal's phased approach offers a structured pathway to mitigate the quantum threat while maintaining the integrity and continuity of the Bitcoin network. It emphasizes the importance of stakeholder incentives to upgrade, including the potential for higher fees for miners due to increased demand for block space and the fiduciary duty of institutional holders to safeguard assets against quantum attacks.

In summary, the proposal presents a defensive strategy against the quantum threat to Bitcoin, emphasizing the urgency of adopting post-quantum cryptography measures. By aligning the ecosystem with a clear, time-boxed plan, the proposal aims to secure Bitcoin's future in the face of rapidly advancing quantum computing capabilities.</summary>
