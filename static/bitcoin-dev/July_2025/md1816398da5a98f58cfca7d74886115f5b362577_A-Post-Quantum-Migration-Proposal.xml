    <summary>In the evolving landscape of Bitcoin development, a significant conversation revolves around the impending threat posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency's foundational security mechanisms. A proposal has surfaced from within the community that suggests a preemptive and structured approach to mitigating this quantum threat without necessitating a hard fork, which would be a major alteration to the blockchain requiring all participants to upgrade their software to maintain compatibility.

The proposed strategy introduces a phased approach, beginning with Phase A, which would disallow the sending of funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses, effectively hastening the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) output types, specifically P2QRH addresses as outlined in BIP-360. This phase aims to reduce the future risk by preventing any more funds from being locked into vulnerable addresses. Following this, Phase B would render ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid, thereby preventing any spending from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. This phase is set to activate on a well-publicized flag day approximately five years after its implementation. An optional Phase C could follow, based on further research and demand, proposing a fork to allow for the recovery of legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK proof) of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase.

This approach not only seeks to secure the value of the Bitcoin network against quantum computing attacks but also aims to provide clarity and certainty to Bitcoin users and stakeholders by offering a clear, publicized timeline for these protective measures. The urgency of such measures is underscored by recent advancements in quantum computing, including the ratification of three production-grade PQ signature schemes by NIST in 2024 and predictions of cryptographically relevant quantum computers emerging as early as 2027-2030. Quantum algorithms are improving at a pace that significantly lowers the hardware requirements necessary for breaking classical encryption, posing an immediate and existential threat to Bitcoin's security.

Moreover, the proposal highlights the existing vulnerabilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem, noting that approximately 25% of all bitcoin have already exposed their public keys on-chain, making them potential targets for quantum theft. It also points out the challenges in upgrading the vast, distributed network of wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians. Historically, Bitcoin has been slow to adopt new code changes, often taking multiple years for consensus to be reached. The proposed timeline and phases aim to overcome this inertia by providing a structured pathway for migration to quantum-resistant protocols.

Additionally, this strategy introduces a unique incentive model. By rendering quantum-vulnerable UTXOs unspendable after a certain point, it effectively turns quantum security into a private incentive for users to migrate their funds to newer, secure addresses. This could lead to a scenario where lost or abandoned coins become permanently unspendable, potentially reducing the total supply of circulating bitcoins, as Satoshi Nakamoto once suggested, albeit in a different context.

To ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruption, the proposal outlines a series of soft forks rather than a single, sweeping hard fork. Older nodes will continue to operate without modification, though they will view post-quantum witness programs as anyone-can-spend scripts until upgraded. This phased approach allows for gradual adaptation across the network, providing both a defense against quantum threats and a roadmap for the future evolution of Bitcoin's security protocols.</summary>
