    <summary>In a recent update from the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, James O'Beirne shared insightful metrics on Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) usage within the Bitcoin network. The data highlighted indicates that approximately 156,309 Bitcoins, making up 0.79% of the total supply, are currently held in P2TR outputs. Furthermore, these outputs constitute 34.7% of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) count, amounting to 57,956,440 P2TR UTXOs as of the latest statistics.

The communication also presented averages over the past 30 days, revealing an increasing trend in P2TR adoption. Specifically, P2TR outputs by value accounted for 8.3%, and the output count represented 20.0% of the total. Inputs into P2TR transactions were categorized into two types: KP (key path) and SP (script path), with their respective averages standing at 16.0% and 7.0%. This upward trajectory in utilization suggests a growing interest and engagement in P2TR transactions, likely spurred by enhanced efficiency in UTXO management and wallet upgrades following the clearance of the mempool at January's end.

These insights were supported by data sourced from various analytical platforms, such as Dune Analytics and Mainnet Observer, which provide detailed charts and metrics on Bitcoin's UTXO set and transaction types ([Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/murchandamus/bitcoins-utxo-set), [Mainnet Observer - output type distribution by amount](https://mainnet.observer/charts/output-type-distribution-amount/), [output type distribution by count](https://mainnet.observer/charts/output-type-distribution-count/), and [inputs types by count](https://mainnet.observer/charts/inputs-types-by-count/)). This information underlines the evolving landscape of Bitcoin transactions, emphasizing the significant, albeit gradual, adoption of P2TR outputs within the ecosystem.</summary>
