    <summary>In recent discussions among the Bitcoin development community, concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of advanced computing technologies on cryptographic security. Despite theoretical algorithms existing that could compromise cryptographic primitives if analog computers or concepts such as multiverse brute-forcing were to become reality, these notions remain largely speculative. The consensus within the community is that the technology required to realize such capabilities is far from being physically possible. This skepticism extends to the realm of quantum computing, where, despite claims of progress, no significant breakthroughs have been made in achieving cryptographic relevance with quantum hardware. The capabilities of current quantum computing hardware in terms of affecting cryptography are considered minimal at best.

The email highlights a prevailing opinion within parts of the physics and computer science communities that question the physical feasibility of advanced quantum computing technologies aimed at breaking cryptographic codes. This perspective emphasizes the notion that until tangible progress is made in the field of quantum computing, concerns about its potential to undermine cryptographic foundations are premature. Moreover, the message points out that the idea of preemptively freezing assets based on the speculative future capabilities of quantum computing is not under consideration. The lack of concrete advancements in making quantum computing a threat to cryptography underscores this stance.
