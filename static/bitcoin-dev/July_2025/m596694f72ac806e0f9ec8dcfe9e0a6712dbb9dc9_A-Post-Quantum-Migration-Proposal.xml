    <summary>The discussion revolves around the current state and potential future of cryptographic security in relation to advances in computing technology, particularly focusing on analog and quantum computers. It highlights that while there are known algorithms that could theoretically break cryptographic primitives if advancements in analog computing or even more speculative technologies like "split the universe" brute forcing were to materialize, the practical realization of such computing capabilities remains highly doubtful. This skepticism extends to quantum computing, where despite claims of progress, no significant demonstration of cryptographic-relevance has been achieved. The capabilities of existing quantum hardware in terms of affecting cryptography are described as minimal, with the feasibility of such technologies still being an open question.

Moreover, the narrative underscores a widespread disbelief within the broader physics community — outside of those directly involved in quantum computer development or research — regarding the physical realizability of these advanced computing forms. This skepticism suggests that concerns over their potential impact on cryptographic systems are currently viewed as theoretical rather than imminent threats.

Given this background, the approach towards handling potential vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems remains conservative. The idea of preemptively freezing digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, due to the theoretical threat posed by these futuristic computing technologies is dismissed as premature. Until there's clear evidence of progress towards making these advanced computing technologies practically viable for breaking cryptographic systems, drastic measures such as freezing assets are not considered a reasonable response.
