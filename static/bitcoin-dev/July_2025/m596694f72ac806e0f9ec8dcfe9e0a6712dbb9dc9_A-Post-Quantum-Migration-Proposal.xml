    <summary>The discourse on the current state of quantum computing and its impact on cryptographic security, particularly in relation to Bitcoin, highlights several critical insights. Firstly, there's an acknowledgment of existing algorithms capable of undermining cryptographic primitives, contingent upon the hypothetical existence of advanced analog computers or the ability to perform "split the universe" brute-forcing techniques. However, these scenarios are largely dismissed by the broader scientific community due to the impracticality and theoretical nature of such technologies, casting doubts on their physical realizability.

Further scrutiny reveals skepticism towards the hype surrounding quantum computing advancements. Despite numerous claims of progress within the quantum computing domain, there remains a significant gap between theoretical capabilities and practical, cryptographic-relevant applications. The performance of current quantum computing hardware in tasks critical for cryptographic security is considered negligible, leading to a consensus that no breakthroughs have been made that would jeopardize cryptographic frameworks in the near term.

This skepticism extends to perceptions within parts of the physics community not directly involved in quantum computing research or sales. There's a prevailing belief that the physical feasibility of quantum computers, in a sense that would affect cryptography, remains an unsettled question. Consequently, this uncertainty about the future capabilities and effects of quantum computing justifies a cautious approach towards drastic measures such as freezing assets based on speculative technological threats.

For more detailed exploration of these topics, Peter Todd provides further insights on his website, which can be accessed [here](https://petertodd.org). This discussion underscores the importance of separating realistic assessments of technology from speculative or theoretical possibilities, especially when considering policies or actions that would have significant implications for digital asset security and ownership.</summary>
