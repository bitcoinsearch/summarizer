    <summary>The discussion initiated by Boris Nagaev touches on the complexities surrounding block space availability and cost in the Bitcoin network, emphasizing the importance of addressing these challenges despite acknowledging that his current focus might seem premature given other unresolved issues. Nagaev argues that it is not too soon to contemplate long-term problems of significant complexity, suggesting that extensive discussion is necessary to navigate the intricate landscape of blockchain technology and its future.

He also refutes the notion that proposals made by individuals or small groups amount to central planning, underlining the decentralized essence of Bitcoin where consensus is achieved through widespread voluntary adoption. This decentralized framework ensures that no participant can be forced into action, preserving the autonomy of users against both the migration from quantum-vulnerable to quantum-safe locking scripts and the decision to cease using a network that fails to protect against potential quantum threats.

Nagaev further elucidates on the alignment of incentives among various stakeholders within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including holders, miners, and businesses. He posits that these parties are logically motivated to avoid operating on a network susceptible to theft and the effective inflation resulting from the "resurrection" of lost coins through quantum computing capabilities. The collective action stemming from a broad agreement among diverse actors, according to Nagaev, should not be conflated with collectivism, as Bitcoin's governance eschews traditional political theories and models in favor of crypto-anarchy. Through this lens, he advocates for an analysis based on incentives and game theory rather than imposing external governance frameworks onto the inherently anarchic and decentralized nature of Bitcoin.</summary>
