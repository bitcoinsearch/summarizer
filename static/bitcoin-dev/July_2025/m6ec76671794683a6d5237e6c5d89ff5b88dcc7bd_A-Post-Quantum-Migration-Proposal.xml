    <summary>Antoine challenges Jameson's perspective on the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin, arguing that cryptographic primitives are constantly analyzed and updated to mitigate potential weaknesses. He emphasizes that the progression of cryptanalysis and number theory is ongoing and suggests that a shift to lattice-based cryptographic schemes does not guarantee absolute security due to the possibility of discovering novel flaws. Antoine criticizes the notion of freezing vulnerable Bitcoin as an extraordinary measure, warning it could set a dangerous precedent for technically confiscating coins without owner consent for reasons deemed extraordinary by the community. This, he argues, could lead to future abuses and erosion of fundamental Bitcoin properties.

Antoine further critiques the idea of protecting Bitcoin's price as an end in itself, questioning the comparison of Bitcoin's value against fiat currencies or hard assets like oil. He dismisses the notion that Bitcoin developers have any fiduciary duty to maintain its price relative to other asset classes, pointing out the subjective nature of value and the problematic aspects of applying game theory and utilitarianism to such scenarios. He acknowledges the concerns of institutional stakeholders about the quantum threat but suggests legal and technical remedies such as force majeure, opt-in upgrades to post-quantum cryptography, and specific insurance policies as solutions rather than preemptive confiscation of vulnerable coins.

Moreover, Antoine warns against sacrificing Bitcoin's conservatism for short-term concerns like price stability, advocating instead for an opt-in upgrade path and proactive education to encourage users to secure their coins against quantum threats without resorting to confiscation. He supports allowing quantum computers to claim old, vulnerable coins, seeing this as a temporary inflationary pressure rather than a long-term problem, and urges the community to demonstrate resilience in the face of potential price fluctuations. Antoine's stance is firmly against the confiscation of old coins and emphasizes the importance of maintaining Bitcoin's fundamental properties and ethical standards, even in the face of technological advances such as quantum computing.</summary>
