    <summary>Antoine challenges the view that Bitcoin has never faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives, arguing that cryptanalysts and number theorists continually analyze its cryptographic elements for potential weaknesses. He suggests that even with updates to lattice-based schemes, there's no certainty against discovering new flaws. Antoine expresses concern over proposals to freeze vulnerable coins without owner consent, fearing this could set a dangerous precedent for future technical interventions that might compromise Bitcoin's fundamental properties. He argues that protecting Bitcoin's price or comparing its value against other assets shouldn't be a priority for developers, emphasizing that Bitcoin's value proposition is not directly tied to its exchange rate against fiat currencies or commodities.

In discussing the implications of quantum threats on Bitcoin, Antoine points out the legal doctrine of "force majeure," suggesting that industry participants should be able to shield themselves from unforeseen quantum breakthroughs. He recommends that stakeholders could adopt post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes such as Dilithium or Falcon on an opt-in basis, thereby securing their holdings without necessitating a network-wide mandate. Furthermore, he questions why concerned parties, like exchanges, haven't sought insurance against quantum threats, indicating that the fear of quantum computing may reflect a lack of diversification in asset holdings rather than an imminent threat to Bitcoin itself.

Antoine argues against confiscating old, potentially vulnerable coins, advocating instead for allowing those with quantum capabilities to exploit these coins. This approach, he believes, would have a temporary inflationary effect on Bitcoin but aligns with a philosophy of low time preference, essentially letting market forces play out. He emphasizes the importance of opting for proactive education and voluntary upgrades to more secure address types to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing, rather than resorting to drastic measures that could undermine the cryptocurrency's foundational principles.</summary>
