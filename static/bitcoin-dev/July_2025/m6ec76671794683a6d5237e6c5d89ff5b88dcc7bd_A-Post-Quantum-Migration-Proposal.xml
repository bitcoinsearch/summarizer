    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The discussion on the existential threat Bitcoin faces due to advancements in quantum computing and its potential impact on cryptographic primitives is deeply nuanced. Antoine argues against Jameson Lopp's perspective that Bitcoin has never before faced such a significant threat, suggesting instead that cryptanalysts and number theorists are continually making progress in uncovering potential weaknesses in Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations. He points out that even with a shift to lattice-based schemes, there's no guarantee against discovering novel flaws, highlighting the ongoing modifications of NIST-approved schemes as evidence that achieving absolute security might be unattainable.

Antoine expresses concern over the proposal to freeze "vulnerable" coins without owner consent, fearing it could set a dangerous precedent. He worries this could lead to future technical confiscations for extraordinary reasons, potentially undermining one of Bitcoin's fundamental properties. Antoine also criticizes the rationale that protecting Bitcoin's price justifies such actions, questioning the comparison of Bitcoin's value against fiat or hard assets and arguing against a fiduciary duty to maintain Bitcoin's price relative to other asset classes.

Furthermore, Antoine discusses the implications of quantum threats for institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and other industry providers. He suggests that legal concepts like "force majeure" could offer protection against quantum risks and proposes opt-in upgrades to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes as a solution for individual users and custodians concerned about their holdings' security. Additionally, he questions why industry players deeply worried about quantum threats impacting their operations haven't sought specific insurance coverage against such risks.

Lastly, Antoine advocates for an ethical response to the quantum threat that emphasizes education, outreach, and voluntary upgrades to secure address types rather than confiscating vulnerable coins. He supports allowing those with quantum capabilities to "free up" old coins, suggesting that any inflationary impact on Bitcoin's price would be transitory and align with the interests of those holding Bitcoin with low time preference. This stance contrasts with proposals for proactive measures that might compromise Bitcoin's conservative principles for short-term stability, underscoring the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of technological advances and market fluctuations.</summary>
