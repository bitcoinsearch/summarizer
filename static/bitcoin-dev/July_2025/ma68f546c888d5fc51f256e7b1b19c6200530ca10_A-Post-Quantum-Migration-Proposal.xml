    <summary>In the discussion about advancements in Bitcoin's security, particularly regarding resistance to quantum computing threats, an emphasis is placed on the approach of how restrictions are applied. The focus is on the need for these restrictions to be specifically tied to the cryptographic operations required for spending, rather than being broadly associated with the type of output script used. This distinction is crucial for ensuring flexibility and future-proofing the system against potential quantum computing threats.

A particular point of interest is the recommendation for users of P2QRH (Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash) to include a leaf script that supports post-quantum opcodes in their transactions. This inclusion would not necessitate immediate definition or deployment of these opcodes but would allow for a more seamless transition to post-quantum cryptography through a straightforward software update once these are fully developed and defined. This strategy underscores the proactive measures needed to safeguard Bitcoin against emerging technological challenges, highlighting the importance of forward-thinking in the development and implementation of cryptographic standards.</summary>
