    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the importance of basing restrictions on cryptographic operations necessary for spending, rather than broadly categorizing them by output script type. Specifically, it highlights the case of P2QRH (Pay to Quantum Resistant Hash), suggesting that users adopting this method should include a leaf script capable of supporting post-quantum opcodes. The rationale behind this approach is to facilitate an easier transition to post-quantum cryptography through a simple software update when such opcodes are fully defined and implemented. This strategy underscores the need for forward-thinking in cryptographic practices within the Bitcoin development community, especially in preparing for advancements in quantum computing that could impact current cryptographic standards.</summary>
