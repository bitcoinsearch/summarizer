    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the importance of basing restrictions on the cryptographic operations required for spending rather than broadly categorizing them by output script type. Specifically, it highlights the scenario with Pay-to-Quantum-Resistant-Hashes (P2QRH), suggesting an ideal approach where users include a leaf script capable of supporting post-quantum opcodes, even in the absence of their complete definition. This strategy would facilitate an easy transition to post-quantum cryptography through a simple software update, ensuring readiness and adaptability for future technological advancements in quantum computing and its potential impact on cryptographic security. This perspective underlines a proactive measure in securing Bitcoin transactions against emerging threats, by advocating for the inclusion of forward-compatible features within the cryptocurrency's operational framework.</summary>
