    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>In the ongoing discussion about the future of Bitcoin's security in the face of quantum computing threats, a nuanced approach towards transaction restrictions has been suggested. The focus is on tailoring restrictions based on the cryptographic operations required for spending bitcoins rather than applying broad limitations based on the output script type. This perspective emphasizes the importance of adaptability within the Bitcoin protocol to enhance security measures against potential quantum computing challenges.

A specific proposal highlighted in the discourse is the inclusion of a leaf script that supports post-quantum (PQ) opcodes within P2QRH transactions. This strategy is not just about preparing for the eventual definition and implementation of post-quantum cryptographic standards but also ensuring that the transition to PQ cryptography can be as seamless as possible. By embedding support for PQ opcodes in advance, the Bitcoin community can make a future shift towards PQ crypto through a straightforward software update, thereby safeguarding against quantum threats with minimal disruption.

This approach reflects a proactive stance in cryptocurrency development, focusing on foresight and flexibility to secure the network against evolving technological advancements. It underscores the critical need for continuous innovation and adaptation in the digital currency landscape, especially in response to the looming advent of quantum computing capabilities.</summary>
