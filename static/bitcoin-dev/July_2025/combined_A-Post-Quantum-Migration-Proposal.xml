    <summary>The discourse surrounding Bitcoin's vulnerability to quantum computing has prompted a multifaceted proposal aimed at bolstering the cryptocurrency against future quantum threats. This proposal introduces a structured approach, encapsulating the implementation of a post-quantum output type (P2QRH) and delineating a timeline for the gradual obsolescence of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures. The phased strategy commences with prohibiting transactions to quantum-susceptible addresses, thereby accelerating the adoption of P2QRH address types. Subsequently, a phase is introduced where transactions from quantum-vulnerable Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are invalidated, effectively barring traditional cryptographic methods. An optional phase contemplates the reactivation of these assets through zero-knowledge proofs, dependent on further research and community consensus.

This initiative stems from the imperative to preserve the intrinsic value and trust within the Bitcoin ecosystem in the face of potential quantum computing advancements. Quantum technology represents a significant challenge to Bitcoin's security infrastructure, capable of compromising its cryptographic foundation. With the rapid progression in quantum algorithms and the endorsement of post-quantum signature schemes by authoritative bodies such as NIST, the urgency for a preemptive defensive strategy becomes evident. A successful quantum assault on Bitcoin would not only diminish network confidence but also inflict substantial economic turmoil. Consequently, this proposal advocates for a proactive stance, instituting explicit benchmarks for transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptographic mechanisms well ahead of a viable quantum incursion.

By establishing clear migration deadlines, the proposal seeks to synchronize the Bitcoin community's efforts, mitigating upgrade inertia and fostering a unified front against quantum threats. It delineates the roles and obligations of various stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and regular users, highlighting the collective benefits of diminishing the attack surface and curtailing potential losses. The transition to quantum-resistant cryptography is posited as essential for the security and longevity of Bitcoin.

In addressing backward compatibility, the proposal notes that implementing these changes through soft forks allows legacy nodes to function without alterations while strongly encouraging updates to validate new post-quantum transactions comprehensively. This methodical, phased implementation offers stakeholders sufficient time to adapt, ensuring the Bitcoin network's resilience in anticipation of quantum computing advancements.</summary>
