    <summary>In an effort to address the potential threats posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin, a comprehensive proposal has been introduced, focusing on the gradual implementation of post-quantum cryptographic standards within the Bitcoin network. The proposal outlines a phased approach to minimize the risk of quantum attacks and incentivize the ecosystem's migration towards more secure cryptographic practices.

The initial phase of the proposal aims to prevent any new transactions from being sent to quantum-vulnerable addresses by disallowing spends to legacy script types. This measure is designed to hasten the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) output type (P2QRH) address types, as described in BIP-360 or potential future proposals. Following this, a subsequent phase will render all transactions relying on ECDSA/Schnorr signatures invalid, effectively freezing funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. This action is set to be triggered by a well-publicized flag day approximately five years after the initial activation, marking a significant step towards securing the Bitcoin network against quantum threats.

An optional phase could be introduced, subject to further research and consensus, which would allow for the recovery of legacy UTXOs through a zero-knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase. This provision aims to offer a pathway for users to recover their funds in a post-quantum world, ensuring that the value locked in older addresses isn't permanently lost due to technological advancements.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the increasing feasibility of quantum attacks on Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundation. With rapid advancements in quantum algorithms and the potential for quantum computers to decrypt exposed public keys, there is a pressing need to preemptively address these vulnerabilities. Approximately 25% of all Bitcoin has already exposed its public key on-chain, presenting a clear and present danger should quantum capabilities reach a critical threshold.

Moreover, the proposal highlights the challenges of coordinating upgrades across Bitcoin's decentralized landscape. Historically, the ecosystem has been slow to adopt new protocols, underscoring the importance of establishing a clear, time-boxed strategy for transitioning to quantum-resistant technologies. By setting definitive deadlines and outlining explicit actions required by various stakeholders, the proposal seeks to streamline this transition, mitigating the risk of inertia and complacency.

In essence, this initiative represents a proactive defense mechanism against the existential threat posed by quantum computing. By converting quantum security into a private incentive, the proposal aims to galvanize the Bitcoin community into action, safeguarding the network’s integrity and the value of its native currency. Furthermore, this approach aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision, wherein the elimination of vulnerable coins not only enhances the security of the network but also potentially increases the value of the remaining coins by reducing the overall supply.</summary>
