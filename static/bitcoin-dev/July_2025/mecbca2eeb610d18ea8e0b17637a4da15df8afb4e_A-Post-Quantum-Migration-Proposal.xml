    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>In an innovative approach to enhance the security of Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats, a comprehensive proposal has been introduced that focuses on a gradual transition to post-quantum cryptography. This includes the introduction of a new output type, P2QRH, as outlined in BIP-360, and a well-defined plan for phasing out quantum-vulnerable cryptographic signatures such as ECDSA and Schnorr. The proposal is structured into several phases to systematically address the migration to quantum-resistant protocols, aiming to incentivize users to upgrade their wallets and secure their assets from quantum theft.

The initial phase, Phase A, prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, pushing for the adoption of P2QRH address types. This measure is designed to begin three years after the implementation of BIP-360. Following this, Phase B will see the invalidation of spends from quantum-vulnerable outputs, with a flag day set approximately two years after Phase A's activation. This decisive action aims to prevent any spending of funds that are susceptible to quantum attacks. An optional Phase C may introduce a method for recovering legacy UTXOs through zero-knowledge proofs, offering a pathway for users who failed to migrate in time to reclaim their assets.

The urgency of these measures stems from the rapid advancements in quantum computing and its implications for Bitcoin's security. Notably, the exposure of roughly 25% of all bitcoin public keys on-chain presents a significant risk, as these could be compromised by sufficiently powerful quantum computers. Furthermore, the unpredictable nature of quantum attacks, coupled with the historical inertia in coordinating upgrades across Bitcoin's decentralized network, underscores the need for a proactive and unified response.

Benefits of the proposed strategy include bolstering the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol against quantum threats, providing clarity and certainty to users and stakeholders about the network's future, and aligning ecosystem participants towards a common goal. Additionally, the reduction in supply due to unclaimed or lost keys aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's principle that lost coins increase the value of the remaining ones, whereas quantum-recovered coins would have the opposite effect.

The proposal also highlights the critical motivation for various stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, to support and facilitate the transition. For instance, miners stand to benefit from increased demand for block space and higher fees, while institutional holders and service providers face fiduciary and operational risks if they fail to adapt.

By turning quantum security into a private incentive, the proposal aims not only to defend Bitcoin from potential quantum attacks but also to preserve the trust and value inherent in the network. With backward compatibility ensured through soft forks, the plan encourages widespread adoption of the new standards, ensuring Bitcoin remains secure and viable in the face of evolving quantum technologies.</summary>
