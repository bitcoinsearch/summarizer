    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The email from Boris dives into innovative strategies aimed at preserving funds amidst potential blockchain forks, particularly focusing on scenarios where spending might be constrained or blocked due to the implementation of freezing or commit/reveal schemes. He proposes a nuanced approach to rolling out such forks incrementally across the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set. By dividing the UTXO set into 256 groups based on the first byte of the transaction ID and processing one group daily, the system ensures that not all users are affected simultaneously. This method provides procrastinators ample time to act and safeguard their funds, minimizing the overall impact on coin owners. Additionally, Boris suggests offering a temporary opt-out for users who find their transactions blocked. By sending a specific transaction, users could temporarily revert to the old acceptance rules for their transaction, allowing them to move their funds without needing advanced knowledge of the new system's workings.

Building on these ideas, Boris extends his discussion to address the broader issue of quantum computing threats to Bitcoin, drawing on an earlier essay against quantum recovery of Bitcoin. He outlines a formal proposal focusing on the gradual adoption and migration to post-quantum cryptography, specifically through the implementation of a post-quantum output type (P2QRH) as described in BIP-360. The proposal includes a phased approach: initially disallowing funds to be sent to quantum-vulnerable addresses to encourage the adoption of P2QRH addresses, followed by invalidating ECDSA/Schnorr spends to prevent spending from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, with an optional phase allowing for the recovery of legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge proofs of possession of BIP-39 seed phrases.

Boris emphasizes the existential threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations, noting the rapid progress in quantum algorithms and the increasing feasibility of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. He highlights the urgency of migrating to quantum-resistant protocols, pointing out the significant portion of Bitcoin that has already exposed public keys on-chain and thus could be vulnerable to theft with sufficient quantum computational power.

The proposal seeks to incentivize stakeholders across the Bitcoin ecosystem, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, to adopt upgraded, quantum-resistant practices. By establishing clear timelines and consequences for inaction, the proposal aims to ensure the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol against quantum attacks, providing clarity and certainty for the future. Boris argues that this proactive defense strategy is essential to maintain trust and value in Bitcoin in the face of emerging quantum threats, concluding with a call to action for the community to consider and adopt these measures to protect the integrity and security of the network.</summary>
