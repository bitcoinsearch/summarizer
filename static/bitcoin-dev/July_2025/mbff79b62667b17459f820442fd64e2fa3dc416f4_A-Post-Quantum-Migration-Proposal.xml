    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there was significant debate regarding a proposed Post Quantum Migration plan. The proposal, which emphasizes preemptive measures against potential quantum computational threats to cryptographic securities, has sparked diverse opinions among participants. The main contention surrounds the suggestion of deactivating EC output types as a way to safeguard against these future threats. Critics argue that such a move, while cautious, might be overly preemptive and could lead to disabling important functionality or even destroying coins without certainty that such a quantum threat will materialize.

The conversation highlights differing perspectives on how to define "quantum-vulnerable UTXO". For instance, there's deliberation on whether any Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH) or Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) outputs should be considered vulnerable, especially if the public key has already been made known. The distinction is crucial because it affects which transactions would be disabled under the proposed migration plan. Some participants advocate for a more nuanced approach that allows spending from outputs where the public key hasn't been revealed through commit/reveal schemes. These schemes are being explored as a method to enable secure transactions indefinitely, even in the face of potential quantum computing advancements.

The discussion also delves into the broader community's sentiments regarding the balance between caution and functionality. There are those who argue for disabling Elliptic Curve (EC) spends as a conservative measure to protect against an unproven but theoretically possible quantum threat. Conversely, others caution against such drastic measures that could lead to irreversible loss of assets based on speculative future developments. This division underscores a persistent disagreement within the community about how to approach the theoretical emergence of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs).

Ultimately, the discourse suggests a hope among some participants that, should concrete evidence emerge proving the vulnerability of secp256k1 to quantum attacks, there would be a consensus towards freezing known-pubkey EC outputs as a protective measure. This reflects a shared understanding of the need to balance security concerns with the practical implications of disabling key functionalities within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
