    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The discourse within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List highlights a debate on the proposal for a post-quantum migration strategy for Bitcoin, specifically focusing on the idea of deactivating EC (Elliptic Curve) output types to protect against potential quantum computing threats. Critics argue that such a move could be premature and detrimental, potentially leading to the disabling of crucial functionalities and even the preemptive destruction of coins based on the anticipation of quantum computing risks that may not materialize. Furthermore, the challenge of defining "quantum-vulnerable UTXO" (Unspent Transaction Output) is raised, questioning whether all P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash) or P2WPKH (Pay to Witness Public Key Hash) outputs should be considered vulnerable, or only those where the public key has already been exposed.

The conversation also explores alternative protective measures, such as commit/reveal schemes, which could offer a safer method for spending from outputs without exposing them to quantum vulnerabilities, especially in cases where the public key has yet to be revealed. This suggests a nuanced approach to security, considering both the theoretical capabilities of quantum computing and the practical implications of disabling certain cryptographic functions.

Amidst these technical discussions, there's an underlying acknowledgment of the diverse perspectives within the community regarding the balance between caution and functionality. The potential existence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) poses a significant threat, yet the absence of concrete evidence for such a device fuels ongoing debate. Some members express a preference for disabling Elliptic Curve spends as a precautionary measure, while others argue against it to avoid unnecessary losses. Ultimately, the consensus leans towards a more cautious approach, with significant support for freezing known-pubkey EC outputs if undeniable proof of a CRQC's ability to break secp256k1 encryption emerges, highlighting the community's readiness to adapt should a definitive quantum threat be identified.</summary>
