    <summary>Jameson Lopp addresses concerns regarding the proposed "Forced Sunset Approach" for Bitcoin's quantum resistance migration, particularly highlighting the potential violation of Bitcoin’s social contract, the economic risks associated with making a significant portion of Bitcoin unspendable (the 25% problem), and the overly optimistic timeline that underestimates the complexities of achieving consensus within the Bitcoin community. These concerns underscore the fundamental shifts in Bitcoin’s value proposition and the potential for massive economic disruption due to the forced invalidation of ECDSA/Schnorr spends.

In contrast, Lopp introduces an alternative solution inspired by the work on the Supernova project, which has reached production readiness and implements quantum resistance from its inception. This approach is centered around a dual-signature scheme allowing for three modes of operation: Legacy Mode, where only ECDSA signatures are required; Transition Mode, necessitating both ECDSA and quantum signatures; and Quantum Mode, which relies solely on quantum signatures. This method ensures that users are never locked out of their funds, supports gradual and voluntary migration, maintains backward compatibility indefinitely, and offers immediate protection for those who opt for it.

Supernova's key innovations include hybrid signatures that combine classical and quantum signatures during the transition phase, address format compatibility allowing for coexistence of quantum and standard addresses, independence for users in deciding when to migrate without needing ecosystem-wide coordination, and a proven implementation that includes the world’s first quantum-resistant Lightning Network.

Lopp sees the Supernova project not as competition but as a collaborative opportunity for Bitcoin, suggesting that Bitcoin could benefit from Supernova’s real-world experience with quantum resistance, including the use of NIST-standardized algorithms, quantum-resistant atomic swaps, a quantum-proof Lightning Network, and zero-knowledge proofs for privacy enhancements. He extends an invitation to the Bitcoin community to explore Supernova’s public testnet and contribute feedback, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures against quantum threats to ensure the future of decentralized money. The open-source nature of Supernova invites technical review and collaboration, reflecting Lopp’s commitment to both Bitcoin’s principles and the broader goal of surviving the quantum transition.</summary>
