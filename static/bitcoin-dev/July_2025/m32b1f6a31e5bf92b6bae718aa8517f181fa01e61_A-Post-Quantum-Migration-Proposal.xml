    <summary>Jameson Lopp initiated a discussion by expressing gratitude to James for his comprehensive proposal on addressing the quantum threat to Bitcoin, but also voiced concerns regarding the proposed forced sunset approach. Lopp highlighted several issues with this strategy, such as its potential violation of Bitcoin's social contract by fundamentally altering the value proposition of Bitcoin through the risk of permanent fund loss. He pointed out the "25% Problem," where approximately 5.25 million BTC with exposed public keys could become unspendable, causing economic disruption. Additionally, Lopp raised concerns about the optimistic timeline for implementation, suggesting that the actual timeline might be significantly longer due to the need for consensus and smooth implementation, potentially missing the critical window to counter the quantum threat.

In contrast to the forced migration model, Lopp presented an alternative approach derived from his teamâ€™s work on the Supernova project, a blockchain designed with quantum resistance from its inception. This model introduces a dual-signature scheme with three operational modes: Legacy Mode, Transition Mode, and Quantum Mode. This framework ensures that users are never locked out of their funds, facilitates gradual and voluntary migration, maintains backward compatibility indefinitely, and provides immediate protection against quantum vulnerabilities for those who seek it.

Lopp outlined several key innovations of the Supernova approach that could be instructive for Bitcoin, including hybrid signatures that require both classical and quantum signatures during the transition phase, compatibility in address format allowing user-driven security levels per transaction, independence in user migration without the need for ecosystem-wide coordination, and a proven implementation track record, including a quantum-resistant Lightning Network.

Emphasizing collaboration over competition, Lopp suggested that Supernova could serve as a practical testbed for quantum migration strategies, sharing their advancements like NIST-standardized algorithms, quantum-resistant atomic swaps, a full Lightning Network with quantum HTLCs, and zero-knowledge proofs for privacy enhancement. He invited the Bitcoin community to explore Supernova, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the quantum threat collectively and offering Supernova's open-source code for technical review and feedback. This invitation reflects a cooperative spirit, aiming to leverage shared knowledge and technology to secure the future of decentralized money in the face of quantum challenges.</summary>
