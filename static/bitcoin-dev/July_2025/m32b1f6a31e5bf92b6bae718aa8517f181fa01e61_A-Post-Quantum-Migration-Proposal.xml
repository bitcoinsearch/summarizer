    <summary>Jameson Lopp raises significant concerns regarding the proposed quantum migration plan for Bitcoin, specifically criticizing its forced sunset approach for rendering ECDSA/Schnorr spends invalid. He highlights that this strategy not only violates the foundational social contract of Bitcoin by forcibly causing the loss of coins that aren't migrated in time but also points out the economic disruption it could cause due to approximately 5.25 million BTC with exposed public keys becoming unspendable. Furthermore, Lopp underscores the optimistic timeline risk, suggesting that the expected smooth transition over five years is likely unrealistic given Bitcoin's history, potentially delaying quantum resistance implementation beyond critical periods.

In contrast, Lopp presents an alternative strategy inspired by their work on Supernova, a Bitcoin-inspired blockchain designed with quantum resistance from its inception. This approach introduces a dual-signature scheme categorized into three operational modes: Legacy Mode, Transition Mode, and Quantum Mode, which ensures users are never locked out of their funds, supports gradual and voluntary migration, maintains indefinite backward compatibility, and offers immediate protection for proactive users.

Key innovations of Supernova worth considering for Bitcoin include hybrid signatures allowing transactions to require both classical and quantum signatures during the transition period, address format compatibility enabling the coexistence of quantum and standard addresses without forcing users to choose security levels per wallet, the elimination of coordination requirements facilitating independent user migration decisions, and a proven production implementation showcasing the world’s first quantum-resistant Lightning Network.

Lopp calls for cooperative exploration rather than competition, suggesting that Supernova’s real-world application of quantum migration strategies could serve as a valuable testbed. He emphasizes the project's alignment with Bitcoin principles through the use of NIST-standardized algorithms, quantum-resistant atomic swaps, a fully functional quantum Lightning Network, and enhanced privacy measures via zero-knowledge proofs. Lastly, Lopp extends an invitation to the Bitcoin community to explore Supernova’s upcoming public testnet, underscoring the urgency in addressing the quantum threat collaboratively to safeguard the future of decentralized currency.</summary>
