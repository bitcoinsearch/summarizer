    <summary>Jameson Lopp has initiated a dialogue regarding the quantum threat to Bitcoin, acknowledging a proposal by James that suggests a migration plan to combat this existential risk. Lopp expresses concerns about the "Forced Sunset Approach" outlined in the proposal, particularly its phase B, which would invalidate ECDSA/Schnorr spends, potentially leading to permanent fund loss for users. This approach is argued to violate Bitcoin's social contract as articulated by Satoshi Nakamoto, posing a significant economic disruption due to the potential unspendability of approximately 5.25 million BTC with exposed public keys. Additionally, Lopp highlights the optimistic timeline of over five years for implementation, suggesting that delays could push actual implementation beyond the critical 2027-2030 window for quantum resilience.

Lopp presents an alternative approach inspired by the Supernova project, a blockchain designed with quantum resistance from its inception. This model introduces a dual-signature scheme enabling three modes of operation: Legacy Mode (ECDSA only), Transition Mode (requiring both ECDSA and quantum signatures), and Quantum Mode (quantum signatures only). This strategy is posited to allow for a gradual, voluntary migration without locking users out of their funds, maintaining backward compatibility indefinitely, and providing immediate protection for those who opt-in.

The Supernova project offers several key innovations for consideration, including hybrid signatures that blend classical and quantum security during transition, address format compatibility allowing for security level choices at the transaction level, independence in user migration decisions, and a proven production implementation of quantum-resistant technologies, such as a Lightning Network capable of handling quantum-level threats.

Lopp advocates for a cooperative path forward, highlighting Supernova's implementation of NIST-standardized quantum-resistant algorithms, atomic swaps, and privacy-enhancing zero-knowledge proofs. He invites the Bitcoin community to explore Supernova as a real-world testbed for quantum migration strategies, emphasizing the urgency of addressing the quantum threat collaboratively to secure the future of decentralized money. The open-source nature of Supernova's codebase is presented as an invitation for technical review and feedback, framing the project not as competition but as a complementary effort towards a shared goal of quantum resilience across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</summary>
