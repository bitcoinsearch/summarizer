    <summary>The email from Maxim raises concerns about the quantum security of taproot wallets, particularly when wallet descriptors with public keys are exposed. He suggests that in such scenarios, even script-spending paths do not offer protection against quantum threats. Moreover, he highlights a potential risk where quantum-powered miners or relay nodes could manipulate transactions by replacing them with alternative ones. This skepticism towards the quantum security of taproot script-path spending challenges the notion that these mechanisms are fully secure in the face of advancing quantum computing capabilities. Maxim's insights contribute to the ongoing discussion within the Bitcoin Development community about enhancing the security features of taproot wallets against quantum threats.</summary>
