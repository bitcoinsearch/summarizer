    <summary>The latest version 0.7.0 of libsecp256k1 has been officially released, marking a significant update that focuses on maintenance improvements with direct implications on the public API and ABI compatibility. This release introduces changes to enhance the library's stability and efficiency. Notably, the constant context objects `secp256k1_context_static` and `secp256k1_context_no_precomp` have been updated to be constant pointers, reinforcing type safety and const correctness in client code. Furthermore, this version deprecates old function aliases related to private key operations, specifically replacing `secp256k1_ec_privkey_&lt;operation&gt;` with `secp256k1_ec_seckey_&lt;operation&gt;`, streamlining the API and encouraging the use of more consistently named functions.

Another significant advancement with version 0.7.0 is the support for CMake as a build system, which transitions from being experimental to fully supported. This move is set to facilitate easier integration and building processes for developers, alongside the continued support for GNU Autotools (using `./configure` and `make`), ensuring that existing workflows remain unaffected. For developers interested in the detailed list of changes, enhancements, and fixes introduced in this update, the full changelog is available at [the project's GitHub page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

This version represents a step forward in the development of libsecp256k1, aiming at improving the usability and reliability of the library for developers working within the Bitcoin ecosystem and beyond. The adjustments and improvements in this release are reflective of the maintainers' commitment to providing a robust and efficient library for cryptographic operations.</summary>
