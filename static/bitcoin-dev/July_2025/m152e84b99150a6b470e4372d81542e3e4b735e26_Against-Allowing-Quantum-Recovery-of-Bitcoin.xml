    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discourse around the potential impact of quantum computing on Bitcoin has sparked a multifaceted debate among developers, cryptographers, and enthusiasts. At the heart of this discussion is the QRAMP proposal, designed to responsibly manage Bitcoin's transition into a post-quantum era without compromising its core principles. The proposal outlines a phased approach: initially allowing wallets to include Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys within Taproot outputs for early adopters, followed by a soft fork that disables vulnerable scripts with a generous grace period, and eventually, the selective deactivation of vulnerable outputs based on age or inactivity. This approach aims to align incentives, maintain security, and provide a clear upgrade path without resorting to confiscation or control.

The debate extends beyond technical implementations, touching on legal, ethical, and philosophical grounds. There is a genuine concern about the potential legal implications of making protocol changes that could lead to fund confiscation, even with ample warning. The fear is that developers could be held liable for losses incurred due to these changes, a risk magnified by previous legal attacks on Bitcoin. Some suggest focusing only on funds likely to be lost already, thereby minimizing legal risks and ethical dilemmas.

Moreover, there's an ongoing discussion about whether old, quantum-vulnerable coins should be left accessible for quantum computers to potentially "free up," or if they should be permanently locked away, effectively "burned." This conversation reveals deep divides within the community, not just about how to technically address quantum threats, but also about the fundamental values underpinning Bitcoin. On one side, there's the argument for preserving every user's right to their coins, advocating for a permissionless system where individuals bear the ultimate responsibility for securing their assets against quantum threats. On the other, some argue for proactive measures to prevent quantum-enabled theft, viewing the potential for widespread loss of funds as antithetical to Bitcoin's promise of secure, sovereign ownership of digital wealth.

The discourse also explores the potential for a split in the Bitcoin community, similar to the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic divide, with factions possibly emerging over differing views on how to handle pre-quantum coins in a post-quantum world. The comparison to Ethereum's DAO incident serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the delicate balance between adhering to immutable code and responding flexibly to unforeseen challenges.

Embedded within these discussions are links to further discourse and examples illustrating the complexities of navigating Bitcoin's future in the face of quantum computing. One cited [discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/bmV1QwYEN4k/m/kkHQZd_BAwAJ) emphasizes the inherent "ethical impedance-mismatch" within Bitcoin, a term whimsically coined to describe the friction between the moral desire to optimize Bitcoinâ€™s functionality and its foundational principle of censorship resistance.

As Bitcoin faces the looming prospect of quantum computing, the community is grappling with questions that cut to the core of what it means to maintain a decentralized, secure, and equitable digital currency. The challenge lies not only in implementing technical solutions but also in navigating the ethical and philosophical quandaries these solutions present.</summary>
