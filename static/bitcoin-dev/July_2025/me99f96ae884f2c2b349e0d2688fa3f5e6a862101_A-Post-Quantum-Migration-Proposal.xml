    <summary>The discussion revolves around the strategic planning of implementing zk-STARK proof systems for enhancing security against potential quantum computing threats within the Bitcoin protocol. The proposition includes a phased approach, where phase B could be deployed independently to safeguard users who delay their security upgrades, thereby offering protection against imminent quantum threats even if the more robust STARK system isn't ready. There's a consideration to merge phases B and C should the development of phase C outpace quantum computing advancements or vice versa, suggesting a flexible deployment strategy contingent on external technological progress.

Further contemplation is given to the implications of permanent changes introduced in phase A, particularly concerning the inability to send to pre-quantum addresses without executing a hard fork. This raises concerns about the permanence of such decisions and their potential impact on network flexibility and user accessibility.

An issue highlighted pertains to the treatment of BIP360 P2QRH addresses across these phases, especially regarding how phase B might handle transactions involving EC signatures from P2QRH UTXOs. The conversation underscores a dilemma: imposing restrictions on EC spending from P2QRH addresses could inadvertently lock funds until the activation of phase C, contradicting the objective of phase A to prevent such scenarios. Conversely, not restricting EC spending could leave P2QRH UTXOs with exposed EC spending conditions vulnerable to quantum attacks, arguably making them less secure than pre-quantum UTXOs which benefit from temporary locking in phase B.

The discourse suggests a preference for universally restricting EC spending to ensure that all users can eventually recover their Bitcoin once phase C is implemented. To mitigate potential issues arising from this restriction, it proposes standardizing the derivation of P2QRH addresses and encouraging the generation of addresses that include at least one post-quantum spending path using ML-DSA and SLH-DSA leaf structures. This approach aims to balance the need for immediate security measures with the long-term goal of seamless transition to quantum-resistant infrastructure within the Bitcoin network.</summary>
