    <summary>The discussion initiated by Boris highlights the strategic planning concerning the deployment phases of a new cryptographic proof system, aimed at enhancing security against potential quantum computing threats. The conversation revolves around the zk-STARK proof system and its implementation across different phases, with flexibility in deployment strategies to accommodate varying rates of quantum computing advancements versus the readiness of the zk-STARK system itself.

The idea of merging deployment phases B and C into a single operation is considered as a contingency plan, depending on the pace of quantum technology development and the progress of phase C's preparation. This approach raises questions about the treatment of pre-quantum addresses and whether they should be allowed at a certain block height post-phase A deployment, which inherently disallows transactions to such addresses without a hard fork. This point underscores the irreversible nature of decisions made in phase A regarding pre-quantum address transactions.

Furthermore, the discussion touches upon the technical aspects and implications of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 (BIP360) Pay-to-QR-hash (P2QRH) addresses under these phased implementations. A significant concern raised pertains to the restriction of Elliptic Curve (EC) signature spending from P2QRH Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), which could inadvertently lock funds until phase C is deployed if all leafs require at least one EC signature opcode. The dilemma here is between preventing accidental fund locks due to phase A restrictions and making P2QRH UTXOs more susceptible to quantum attacks compared to pre-quantum UTXOs, which benefit from temporary locking in phase B.

The consensus appears to lean towards imposing a blanket restriction on EC spending across all script types during phase B, to ensure users can reclaim their Bitcoin once phase C is implemented. To mitigate potential issues arising from such restrictions, the proposal includes standardizing P2QRH address derivation and encouraging the adoption of addresses that incorporate at least one post-quantum spending path through recommended cryptographic methods such as ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. This strategy aims to enhance the security of transactions in anticipation of quantum computing capabilities, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and adaptability in cryptographic practices within the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
