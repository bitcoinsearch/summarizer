    <summary>In a recent discussion among developers, a proposal was put forth to refine the zk-STARK proof system for phase C of a project, with an emphasis on maintaining flexibility in the deployment timeline. The conversation highlighted the potential to deploy phase B independently as a safeguard against rapid advancements in quantum computing. This approach would protect users who might delay updates, even if the STARK system is not fully ready. There's an open consideration regarding whether the phases B and C could be merged into a single deployment if quantum progress is slower than anticipated or if phase C development advances more quickly.

A point of debate is the treatment of phase A in relation to pre-quantum addresses. Once phase A is implemented, the system would prohibit transactions to pre-quantum addresses without a hard fork. This raises concerns about the future possibility of sending to these addresses at a specific blockchain height, suggesting a reevaluation of this policy might be necessary. Additionally, thereâ€™s an ongoing discussion about how P2QRH addresses, which can include EC signature spending conditions, would interact with the different phases. Specifically, whether phase B should enforce stricter rules that prevent EC spends from P2QRH UTXOs, which could inadvertently lock funds until phase C is deployed.

The conversation also touches upon the technical challenges and potential solutions for implementing hybrid spending conditions within P2QRH scripts. This includes the idea of introducing dedicated opcodes for EC/PQ hybrid checksig operations, aiming to enhance security by requiring both elliptic curve (EC) signatures and post-quantum (PQ) signatures. To mitigate risks associated with quantum attacks, especially on P2QRH UTXOs with exposed EC spending leafs, there is a suggestion that phase B should restrict all EC spending across all script types. This would enable users to eventually reclaim their Bitcoin when phase C is implemented.

To support the transition, it's proposed that standardizing P2QRH address derivation and providing libraries for generating addresses with ML-DSA and SLH-DSA leafs are crucial steps. These measures would discourage the creation of P2QRH addresses without a post-quantum spending path, thereby enhancing the overall security of the system against quantum threats.</summary>
