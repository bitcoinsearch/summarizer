    <summary>The discussion highlights the strategic considerations for implementing quantum-resistant measures in blockchain technology, focusing on the zk-STARK proof system's integration across different phases. The conversation acknowledges a flexible approach to deployment that allows for adjustments based on the pace of quantum computing advancements or the project's own developmental speed. There's an option to combine phases B and C if necessary, which raises questions about the treatment of pre-quantum addresses and the need for potential adjustments in phase A to accommodate future changes without resorting to a hard fork.

A specific concern is raised regarding Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 360 Pay-to-QR-hash (P2QRH) addresses and their compatibility with the proposed phases. These addresses, designed to contain Elliptic Curve (EC) signature spending conditions, might face restrictions under phase B's rules, potentially locking funds until the rollout of phase C. This scenario contradicts the initial goal of avoiding such lockups by transitioning smoothly to quantum-resistant addresses. The debate extends to whether all EC spending should be restricted to safeguard against quantum attacks, highlighting a trade-off between security and accessibility.

To mitigate these challenges, there's a proposal to standardize P2QRH address derivation and encourage the creation of addresses that include at least one post-quantum spending path. By doing so, it aims to prevent accidental fund lockups and enhance security against quantum threats. The discussion underscores the complexity of ensuring blockchain resilience in the face of quantum computing while maintaining usability and access for users.</summary>
