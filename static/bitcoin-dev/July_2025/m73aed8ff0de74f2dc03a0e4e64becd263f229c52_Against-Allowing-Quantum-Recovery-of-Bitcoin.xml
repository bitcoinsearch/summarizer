    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin's security has ignited a complex debate among developers and stakeholders. One proposed solution is to restrict the spending of quantum-vulnerable coins, thereby preventing them from entering the more secure, quantum-resistant part of the network. This approach, likened to restricting fiat transactions within the same bank, introduces a significant limitation on property rights, challenging the notion of true ownership in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Concerns are raised about the practicality and ethical implications of such measures, especially given the speculative nature of the quantum threat and the potential for unforeseen consequences.

The discussion explores various perspectives on how to handle quantum-vulnerable Bitcoin outputs. Some suggest that freezing these assets until they can be safely migrated to quantum-resistant addresses is less about confiscation and more about reflecting the reality of their diminished value in the face of quantum threats. Others argue against preemptive actions like freezing, highlighting the risks of selective fund invalidation which could undermine Bitcoin's foundational principles. The debate also considers the technical feasibility and moral considerations of allowing or preventing quantum-enabled theft of vulnerable coins.

Moreover, the conversation delves into the broader implications of quantum computing on Bitcoin's fundamental properties, including censorship resistance, forward compatibility, and conservatism. The principle of "your keys, only your coins" comes under scrutiny in a scenario where quantum capabilities could nullify traditional cryptographic security mechanisms. The discourse extends to the ethical dilemma of whether preventing access to quantum-vulnerable funds constitutes a protective measure or an unjust redistribution of wealth.

Proposals for addressing the quantum challenge include the QRAMP initiative, which outlines a phased approach to introduce post-quantum cryptography (PQC) without forcing immediate migration. This proposal aims to balance security enhancements with respect for user autonomy and the avoidance of drastic measures like fund confiscation. The discussion acknowledges the diversity of opinions within the Bitcoin community, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of incentives, potential market impacts, and the preservation of core principles in any path forward.

This dialogue underscores the complexity of preparing Bitcoin for a post-quantum world, weighing the trade-offs between proactive security measures and the risk of undermining the cryptocurrency's key attributes. As the community grapples with these challenges, the emphasis remains on finding solutions that uphold Bitcoin's ethos of decentralization, user sovereignty, and resilience against evolving threats.</summary>
