    <summary>The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin's security has sparked a significant debate among developers and stakeholders. A key concern is the potential for quantum computers to break the cryptographic algorithms that secure Bitcoin, making older, quantum-vulnerable addresses an easy target for theft. This issue raises complex questions about how to transition the network to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) without undermining Bitcoin's core principles.

One proposal suggests freezing old, vulnerable coins to prevent them from being stolen by quantum-enabled attackers. However, this approach has been likened to confiscation, as it restricts owners' ability to spend their coins freely, challenging the very notion of ownership within the Bitcoin network. Critics argue that such measures could lead to a bifurcation of Bitcoin into two classes: those secure against quantum attacks and those left vulnerable, essentially rendering the latter worthless. Despite these concerns, there is acknowledgment that miners and economic actors might still accept quantum-vulnerable transactions if there's profit in converting them to secure ones, suggesting a potential market solution to the problem.

The debate also touches on broader ethical and practical considerations. Some argue that any preemptive action against quantum threats, like freezing or modifying how coins can be spent, risks opening a Pandora's box of future interventions that could undermine Bitcoin's foundational principles. Others highlight the potential for selective fund invalidation to protect against theft, citing proposals that aim for a non-confiscatory approach to securing vulnerable outputs.

Further complicating the discussion is the QRAMP proposal, which outlines a phased approach to migrating Bitcoin to quantum-resistant cryptography. This plan includes enabling wallets to include PQC keys, announcing a soft fork to disable vulnerable scripts with a long grace period, and gradually deactivating vulnerable outputs based on age or inactivity. Such strategies aim to align incentives, maintain security, and offer a clear path for upgrading without resorting to coercive measures.

Participants in the debate also explore the implications of allowing quantum computers to claim old or lost coins. While some see this as a form of wealth redistribution from inactive or negligent coin holders to technologically advanced entities, others argue that it could incentivize timely upgrades and strengthen the network. Still, the prospect of large-scale quantum theft raises alarms about economic disruption and the erosion of trust in Bitcoin's security.

Throughout these discussions, contributors grapple with the tension between individual liberty and collective action, pondering the extent to which the community should intervene to protect against quantum threats. The conversation underscores the challenges of navigating uncharted technological territory while striving to preserve the decentralized, trustless ethos at the heart of Bitcoin.</summary>
