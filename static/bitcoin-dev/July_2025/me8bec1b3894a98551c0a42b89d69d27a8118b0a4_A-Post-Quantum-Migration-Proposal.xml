    <summary>The email from Marin Ivezic to Peter on the subject of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) sheds light on the ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin development community regarding future-proofing the blockchain against potential quantum computing threats. Ivezic acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the emergence of CRQCs but emphasizes the importance of having a preemptive plan in place. The reference to Lopp's proposal highlights a strategic approach designed for incremental implementation, which would allow the community to respond proportionally to the evolving risk landscape.

Ivezic also touches upon concerns regarding the premature deployment of significant protocol upgrades, which he refers to as freezing upgrades. While he understands the apprehensions about acting too hastily, his perspective leans more towards the likelihood of inaction until the threat becomes undeniably imminent. This anticipation of a delayed response underscores the necessity for a well-prepared action plan that can be swiftly executed in response to a sudden escalation in quantum computing capabilities posing a risk to cryptographic security.

The correspondence underscores a broader recognition of the need for agility and foresight in the development community. By considering the implications of cryptanalytic advancements beyond just quantum computing, the dialogue suggests a proactive stance towards ensuring long-term security and stability for Bitcoin. This forward-thinking approach is not just about mitigating immediate threats but also about establishing a comprehensive framework that can address various future challenges in cryptanalysis.</summary>
