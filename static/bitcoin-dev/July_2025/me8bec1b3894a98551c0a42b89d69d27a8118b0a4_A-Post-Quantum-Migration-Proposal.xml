    <summary>Marin Ivezic's message to Peter emphasizes the critical need for a proactive approach in preparing for potential cryptographic risks, specifically concerning CRQCs (Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers). Despite the uncertainty surrounding the emergence of CRQCs, Ivezic supports Lopp's proposal, which outlines a strategic plan to incrementally address these risks. The proposal is designed to be adaptable, allowing for adjustments as the threat level changes over time. Ivezic argues that even if CRQCs do not materialize or fail to break discrete logarithm problems, the effort spent in planning and designing a migration path would still be beneficial. Such preparedness would provide a framework for responding to other future cryptanalytic breakthroughs, underscoring the value of readiness over complacency.

Ivezic also addresses concerns about premature implementation of certain defensive measures, such as the freezing upgrades detailed in phases A or B of the proposed plan. He acknowledges the risk of acting too hastily but suggests that the greater danger lies in underestimating the threat and delaying action until it becomes urgent. Ivezic believes that a lack of immediate concern may lead to inertia, with the community unlikely to endorse significant preventative steps until faced with undeniable evidence of a threat. This scenario could result in rushed decision-making under pressure. Therefore, Ivezic advocates for having a well-thought-out strategy in place ahead of time, ensuring that the community is equipped to act swiftly and effectively should the need arise.</summary>
