    <summary>In a recent communication, the topic of contingency planning for the potential emergence of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) was addressed. The conversation highlighted the importance of having a robust strategy in place to mitigate the risks associated with CRQCs, even though their actual development remains uncertain. It was noted that Lopp's proposal offers a pragmatic approach by suggesting an incremental rollout plan that can be adjusted according to the escalating risk levels. This method not only prepares us for the potential threat posed by CRQCs but also equips us with a flexible framework to counter future cryptanalytic advancements.

The discussion further acknowledged concerns regarding the premature implementation of certain measures, specifically the freezing upgrades referenced as phases A and B. There is a shared apprehension that the community might act too hastily in adopting these drastic steps without clear evidence of an imminent threat. However, there's also an understanding that the opposite scenario—where action is delayed until the danger becomes overtly visible—poses a significant risk. In such cases, reactive measures would likely be implemented under pressure, leading to rushed decisions. The emphasis was on the necessity of having a ready-to-deploy plan for such eventualities, underscoring the importance of preparation and foresight in navigating the challenges posed by future cryptographic breakthroughs.</summary>
