    <summary>In a recent communication, Marin Ivezic addressed concerns regarding the potential for Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) to disrupt current cryptographic methods. Ivezic acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the emergence of CRQCs but emphasizes the importance of preemptive planning. The proposal by Lopp is highlighted as an effective strategy that offers a scalable solution to increase security measures incrementally in response to escalating risks. This approach ensures readiness for not only the threat posed by CRQCs but also other unforeseen cryptanalytic developments.

Ivezic also responds to worries about premature implementation of critical security upgrades, specifically phases A or B, which could freeze certain operations. While understanding these concerns, Ivezic suggests that the community's tendency might lean towards caution, with significant actions being unlikely without clear and present danger. This cautious stance, however, underscores the necessity for a well-prepared response plan for rapid deployment in the event of an actual threat. The dialogue encapsulates a call for a balanced approach to future-proofing cryptographic defenses, advocating for preparedness without yielding to preemptive fear.</summary>
