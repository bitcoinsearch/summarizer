    <summary>Marin Ivezic addresses the concern regarding the potential non-emergence of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) and emphasizes the importance of having a prepared plan regardless of their development. The discussion centers on Lopp's proposal, which outlines an incremental approach to strengthening security in anticipation of possible cryptanalytic advancements. This plan is not solely focused on the threat posed by CRQCs but also aims to provide a comprehensive strategy for dealing with various future cryptanalytic breakthroughs.

Ivezic acknowledges the apprehension within the community about prematurely implementing significant security upgrades, such as those suggested in the early phases of Lopp's proposal. However, he counters this by expressing a concern that the community may react too slowly, waiting until threats are imminent and fear-driven actions become necessary. The argument suggests that a proactive stance, with ready-to-deploy plans for enhanced security measures, is critical for timely response to potential cryptographic vulnerabilities.

The communication takes place against the backdrop of ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, highlighting the technical and strategic considerations being debated among developers concerned with future-proofing cryptocurrency against quantum computing and other advanced threats.</summary>
