    <summary>Marin Ivezic's communication emphasizes the critical importance of having a proactive strategy to address potential threats from Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs), despite their current non-existence. Ivezic supports Lopp's proposal, which outlines a phased approach to bolster security incrementally as the quantum threat landscape evolves. This approach is not solely focused on the hypothetical breakthroughs in quantum computing but serves as a comprehensive playbook for addressing future cryptanalytic advancements. The email acknowledges concerns within the community about prematurely implementing drastic security measures, such as the proposed "freezing upgrade." However, Ivezic argues that the community's tendency toward caution means that significant actions are unlikely until the threat of quantum computing becomes unequivocally imminent. This perspective underscores the necessity of readiness for rapid response in the face of emerging dangers to cryptographic security.</summary>
