    <summary>Marin Ivezic addresses the concerns surrounding the potential emergence of CRQCs (Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers) and their impact on current cryptographic standards. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the development of CRQCs, Ivezic emphasizes the importance of having a proactive plan in place. The mention of Lopp's proposal highlights a strategic approach that can be implemented incrementally to mitigate risks associated with quantum computing advances. This proposal serves not only as a contingency plan for the breakthroughs in quantum computing but also as a blueprint for navigating future cryptanalytic developments.

Ivezic also discusses the community's apprehension towards premature implementation of drastic measures such as the "freezing upgrade" mentioned in phases A or B. He acknowledges the shared concern about the potential for hasty actions but posits that inertia might be a more likely response until the threat becomes undeniable. The reluctance to make significant changes without clear and present danger is seen as a natural reaction. However, Ivezic argues for the necessity of readiness, suggesting that when the realization of risk becomes acute, the response will need to be swift and well-coordinated. This foresight underscores the balance between caution and preparedness in facing the challenges posed by advancements in quantum computing.</summary>
