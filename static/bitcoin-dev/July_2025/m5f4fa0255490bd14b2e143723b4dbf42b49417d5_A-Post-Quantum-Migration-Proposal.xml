    <summary>In an effort to address the impending threat posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin's security, a comprehensive proposal has been put forward that aims to incentivize the transition towards post-quantum cryptography. This initiative is focused not on debating the myriad of issues surrounding post-quantum cryptographic schemes but rather on ensuring a smooth migration to quantum-resistant protocols once consensus deems it necessary. The proposal outlines a phased approach that begins with the implementation of a post-quantum output type, P2QRH, as described in BIP-360, and culminates in the eventual sunset of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the urgent need to safeguard the value stored within the Bitcoin UTXO set against quantum attacks, which present a radically new kind of threat compared to anything Bitcoin has faced previously. With quantum computing rapidly advancing, evidenced by NIST's ratification of three production-grade post-quantum signature schemes and predictions of cryptographically relevant quantum computers emerging between 2027 and 2030, the risk to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations becomes increasingly imminent. This concern is further compounded by the realization that approximately 25% of all bitcoin have already exposed their public keys on-chain, making them vulnerable to theft by sufficiently powerful quantum computers. The proposal highlights the difficulty in detecting such an attack in its early stages, as attackers could covertly compute private keys and delay transactions to avoid detection.

The proposed solution involves a clearly defined timeline for migrating to quantum-resistant addresses and protocols. Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, encouraging swift adoption of P2QRH addresses. Phase B, occurring approximately five years after the initial activation, invalidates spends from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, essentially freezing these assets unless they've been migrated to secure addresses. An optional Phase C could introduce a mechanism for recovering legacy UTXOs through zero-knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, pending further research and consensus.

This strategic approach aims to minimize the incentive for quantum attacks by creating private incentives for users to upgrade their security protocols. By setting clear deadlines, the proposal seeks to mobilize the entire Bitcoin ecosystem—wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians—towards a coordinated upgrade path. This ensures the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol against quantum threats while providing certainty and clarity to users regarding the future security of their assets. The phased implementation also serves to maintain supply discipline, as Satoshi envisioned, by rendering abandoned keys unspendable.

Stakeholders are motivated to support this transition for various reasons. Miners stand to benefit from increased demand for block space and higher transaction fees, while institutional holders recognize the fiduciary duty to protect investments from quantum threats. Exchanges and custodians face concentrated risk from potential quantum hacks, making early migration a prudent decision to mitigate losses and reputational damage. Everyday users gain the peace of mind of enhanced security, while attackers find diminished economic incentive as the deadline approaches. Overall, the proposal presents a defensive strategy designed to preserve the integrity and value of the Bitcoin ecosystem in the face of quantum advancements.</summary>
