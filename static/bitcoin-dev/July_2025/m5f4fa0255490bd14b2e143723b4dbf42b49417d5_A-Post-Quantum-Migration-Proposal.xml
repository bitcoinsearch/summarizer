    <summary>The proposal under discussion aims to address the challenges posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin's security, without delving into the broader issues of post-quantum cryptography. It focuses on incentivizing the adoption and migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses after a consensus on the necessity for such a move is reached. This approach necessitates the use of P2QRH as outlined in BIP-360 or similar future proposals. The strategy comprises a phased implementation beginning with Phase A, which prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses to accelerate the adoption of P2QRH address types. Phase B will see the invalidation of ECDSA/Schnorr signatures, effectively preventing the spending of funds from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs, enforced by a well-publicized flag day approximately five years following activation. An optional Phase C might introduce a mechanism for recovering legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, contingent on further research and consensus.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin's cryptographic fundamentals, unlike any challenge it has faced before. With rapid advancements in quantum algorithms outpacing hardware improvements and the potential for quantum computers to decrypt exposed public keys, the urgency for a preemptive solution becomes evident. Notably, about 25% of all bitcoin have already exposed their public keys on-chain, making them vulnerable to theft with sufficient quantum computational power. The proposal acknowledges the difficulties in coordinating updates among wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians, emphasizing the need for a clear, time-boxed pathway to mitigate risks and align ecosystem participants.

The benefits of implementing this proposal include ensuring the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol against quantum threats without waiting until the last moment, providing clarity and certainty to users and stakeholders about the plan to counteract these risks, and maintaining supply discipline by rendering un-migrated keys unspendable. The specification details the actions required from various participants across different phases, highlighting the importance of collective action to secure the network.

In essence, this proposal represents a defensive strategy aimed at preserving the value and trust in Bitcoin in the face of potential quantum attacks. By setting a definitive timeline for migration to quantum-resistant addresses and specifying the consequences of non-compliance, it seeks to minimize the attack surface and prevent the catastrophic implications of quantum decryption capabilities. Moreover, it underscores Bitcoin's capacity to adapt to emerging threats, thereby reinforcing its position as a viable long-term investment.</summary>
