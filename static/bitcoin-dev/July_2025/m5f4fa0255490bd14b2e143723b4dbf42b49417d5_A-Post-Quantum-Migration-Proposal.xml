    <summary>The proposal in question aims to address the pressing issue of quantum computing's potential threat to Bitcoin by incentivizing the migration to quantum-resistant addresses and signatures. It outlines a structured approach to transition the Bitcoin network to post-quantum security without delving into the technical complexities of various post-quantum cryptographic schemes. The proposed solution involves three main phases: Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, Phase B invalidates the spending of funds from these addresses, and Phase C, which is optional, would allow for the recovery of legacy UTXOs through a zero-knowledge proof mechanism.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the rapid advancements in quantum computing and the significant threat they pose to the cryptographic underpinnings of Bitcoin. With the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ratifying three production-grade post-quantum signature schemes and estimates suggesting that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer could emerge between 2027 and 2030, the urgency to act is clear. Given that approximately 25% of all bitcoin have exposed their public keys on-chain, making them vulnerable to theft by quantum computers, and the inherent difficulties in detecting such an attack early on, the need for preemptive action is evident.

This proposal differentiates itself from others by focusing on incentivizing the voluntary adoption of quantum-resistant practices rather than attempting to directly counteract quantum threats. By setting clear deadlines for the migration to safer protocols, it aims to minimize the risk of economic disruption and loss of trust in Bitcoin's security. Furthermore, the proposition acknowledges the challenge of coordinating upgrades across the decentralized ecosystem of wallets, exchanges, miners, and custodians, emphasizing the importance of a time-boxed strategy to encourage swift compliance.

The benefits of adopting this proposal are manifold. It ensures the resilience of the Bitcoin protocol against quantum attacks, provides clarity and certainty for users and stakeholders about the network's future direction, and potentially reduces the circulating supply of Bitcoin by rendering abandoned keys unspendable. Additionally, it aligns with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision regarding the deflationary nature of Bitcoin by indirectly removing lost coins from circulation.

In terms of specifications, each phase of the proposal has clear guidelines on what actions must be taken by participants within specified timeframes. After the implementation of BIP-360, there will be a gradual phasing out of quantum-vulnerable script types, culminating in the enforcement of post-quantum witness programs. This phased approach not only secures the network but also provides a structured pathway for users to upgrade their holdings to quantum-resistant formats, thereby protecting their assets from potential quantum attacks.

The proposal emphasizes that acting before the advent of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is crucial to maintaining confidence in Bitcoin's security. By proactively addressing the quantum threat, Bitcoin can demonstrate its adaptability and resilience, reinforcing its position as a secure investment asset. Stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, stand to benefit from this proactive stance by mitigating risks and ensuring the long-term viability of their investments.

In conclusion, turning quantum security into a private incentive represents a strategic defensive measure against potential quantum attacks. This proposal offers a clear, actionable plan to safeguard Bitcoin's cryptographic foundations, providing peace of mind for stakeholders and ensuring the network's integrity in the face of evolving technological challenges.</summary>
