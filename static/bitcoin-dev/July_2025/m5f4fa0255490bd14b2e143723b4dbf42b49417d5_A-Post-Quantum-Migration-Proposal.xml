    <summary>The recent proposal builds upon prior discussions and essays regarding the necessity of Bitcoin to evolve in response to the threats posed by the advancement of quantum computing. It outlines a strategy that does not get into the complexities of post-quantum cryptography but focuses on incentivizing the Bitcoin community towards adopting new, quantum-resistant practices. Central to this strategy is the implementation of a Post-Quantum Output Type (P2QRH) as delineated in BIP-360 or similar future proposals. The initiative introduces a phased approach where initially, transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses would be disallowed, followed by invalidating spends from existing quantum-vulnerable UTXOs. An optional phase might allow for the recovery of these legacy UTXOs through Zero-Knowledge proofs, contingent upon further research and consensus within the community.

The motivation behind this drastic shift in policy stems from the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin's current cryptographic foundations. Notably, with quantum advancements, a significant portion of Bitcoin could become vulnerable to theft, fundamentally undermining the cryptocurrency's value and the security it promises. Reports indicate a rapid improvement in quantum algorithms which, coupled with the already exposed public keys of many Bitcoin UTXOs, creates a fertile ground for potential quantum attacks. These concerns are amplified by the inertia within the Bitcoin community to adopt new changes, stressing the need for a pre-emptive, structured migration path to newer, secure technologies.

The proposed solution envisions a more resilient Bitcoin protocol, offering clarity and certainty to stakeholders about the network's direction in face of quantum threats. By setting clear timelines for the sunset of legacy cryptographic methods and the adoption of quantum-resistant alternatives, the proposal aims to align the entire ecosystem towards minimizing potential disruptions. Notably, the plan also suggests that unclaimed or "lost" coins that fail to migrate will ultimately become unspendable, potentially reducing Bitcoin's overall supply as per Satoshi's original vision.

From an implementation standpoint, this proposal envisages a series of soft forks, ensuring backward compatibility while strongly encouraging node operators to upgrade for full validation of the new quantum-resistant protocols. The transition involves distinct phases where both sending and receiving capabilities are systematically restricted to upgraded wallets, culminating in a scenario where all transactions must use quantum-resistant scripts. This structural evolution of the Bitcoin network underscores a collective defense mechanism against quantum vulnerabilities, prioritizing the security and continuity of the network over the convenience of inertial resistance to change.</summary>
