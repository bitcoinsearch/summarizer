    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The discussion begins with an emphasis on the need for a structured approach to transitioning Bitcoin to a post-quantum cryptographic standard, underscoring the lack of attention to incentivizing adoption and migration of funds once a consensus is reached on the necessity of such a move. The proposal introduces a phased implementation strategy that includes the introduction of a post-quantum output type (P2QRH) and the eventual sunset of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures. This approach aims to turn quantum security into a private incentive, compelling users to upgrade or risk losing access to their funds, thereby creating a certainty of action where previously there was none.

Phase A of the proposed strategy disallows the transfer of funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses, promoting the adoption of P2QRH address types. Phase B takes a more drastic measure by rendering all spends from quantum-vulnerable UTXOs invalid after a well-publicized flag day, roughly five years following activation. An optional Phase C could introduce a method for recovering legacy UTXOs through zero-knowledge proof of possession of a BIP-39 seed phrase, depending on further research and demand.

The motivation behind this proposal is rooted in the existential threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin's cryptographic foundation. With rapid advancements in quantum algorithms and the ratification of production-grade post-quantum signature schemes by NIST, the timeline for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer capable of breaking classical encryption is getting closer. The proposal highlights the urgency of addressing this threat due to the significant portion of Bitcoin that has already exposed public keys on-chain, making them vulnerable to theft by quantum computers.

The benefits of adopting this proposal include enhanced resilience of the Bitcoin protocol, providing users and stakeholders with certainty and clarity regarding the network's defense against quantum threats, and ensuring supply discipline by rendering abandoned keys unspendable. The phased approach also aims to minimize the attack surface, loss of access to funds, and coordination challenges among various stakeholders by setting clear deadlines for migration.

The specification details the actions required during each phase, the stakeholders involved, and the time horizon for implementation. It underscores the importance of upgrading to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing, including the potential devaluation of both the mining hardware and Bitcoin itself, and the existential threat to exchanges and custodians. The proposal concludes by asserting that turning quantum security into a private incentive through this phased approach is a defensive strategy intended to safeguard the Bitcoin ecosystem from potential attacks that could destroy value and trust in the network.</summary>
