    <summary>The proposal outlined is a comprehensive approach to enhancing Bitcoin's security in the face of potential quantum computing threats by introducing post-quantum (PQ) cryptography. It specifically focuses on incentivizing the adoption and migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses through a structured plan without delving into the technical intricacies of post-quantum cryptographic schemes. The plan involves a pre-announced sunset of legacy ECDSA/Schnorr signatures, establishing a phased approach that includes disallowing transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, invalidating spending from such addresses, and potentially enabling recovery of funds trapped in obsolete UTXOs via zero-knowledge proofs.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the accelerating progress in quantum computing, with significant advancements in quantum algorithms and the ratification of production-grade PQ signature schemes by NIST. These developments bring forward the timeline for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin's current cryptographic defenses. Approximately 25% of all bitcoin are at risk due to exposed public keys on the blockchain, presenting an urgent need for preemptive action to secure the network and its assets against quantum attacks.

The proposal outlines three phases to mitigate these risks. Phase A prohibits transactions to quantum-vulnerable addresses, pushing for quicker adoption of P2QRH addresses. Phase B, occurring five years after Phase A's activation, would make ECDSA/Schnorr-based transactions invalid, essentially freezing funds in quantum-vulnerable UTXOs unless migrated beforehand. An optional Phase C could introduce a mechanism for recovering such frozen funds through a zero-knowledge proof of possession of a corresponding BIP-39 seed phrase.

This structured approach aims to minimize the incentives for quantum attacks by reducing the attack surface and ensuring the continuity of Bitcoin's operations through upgraded, quantum-resistant protocols. Stakeholders, including miners, institutional holders, exchanges, custodians, and everyday users, are incentivized to upgrade to maintain access to their funds, avoid potential losses, and uphold their fiduciary duties. The proposal emphasizes the importance of a defensive stance against quantum threats to preserve trust and value within the Bitcoin ecosystem, proposing a balanced timeline for migration to new, secure protocols while maintaining backward compatibility through soft forks.</summary>
