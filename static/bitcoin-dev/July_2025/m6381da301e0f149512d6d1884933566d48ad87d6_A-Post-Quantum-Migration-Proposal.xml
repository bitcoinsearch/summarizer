    <summary>In a detailed discussion about the future security of Bitcoin in the face of quantum computing threats, two main points were highlighted regarding the inclusion of post-quantum signature schemes and the potential economic impacts on Bitcoin's network. The conversation touched upon the proposal for incorporating post-quantum signatures into Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 360 (BIP-360), specifically mentioning a lattice-based scheme and a hash-based scheme (SLH-DSA SPHINCS+). The rationale behind including at least one hash-based scheme is grounded in its robustness and the critical role cryptographic hashes play within the Bitcoin infrastructure, such as in merkle trees, proof of work (PoW), and transaction identifiers (TXID).

The strategy proposed involves using a combination of SLH-DSA for a tapleaf and another more efficient signature scheme for an additional tapleaf. This approach ensures that, regardless of any unforeseen vulnerabilities or cryptanalytic breakthroughs affecting other signature schemes, the SLH-DSA tapleaf would provide a secure method for spending. This method is advocated not just for quantum resistance but also for safeguarding against any unexpected cryptographic advancements, with a specific mention of its utility for securing bitcoins in cold storage over long periods.

Further, the discussion delves into the economic implications of quantum attacks on Bitcoin, particularly concerning the price of electricity for miners. A significant concern raised was the scenario where the cost of electricity, when denominated in Bitcoin, increases drastically. This could lead to miners operating at a loss, potentially ceasing their mining activities, which would subsequently reduce the block rate, increase transaction fees and confirmation times, and possibly trigger a panic within the market. Such conditions could incentivize a soft fork aimed at freezing quantum-vulnerable coins to prevent a mining crisis, despite the acknowledgment that initiating such a fork during a crisis would be less than ideal.

Moreover, it is argued that even if a quantum attacker were to begin stealing vulnerable coins, the fundamental value proposition that "1 BTC will always equal 1 BTC" remains unaffected in principle. However, the practical concerns regarding the operational costs for miners and the overall stability of the Bitcoin network under such a threat are emphasized, suggesting a complex interplay between technological security measures and economic viability within the cryptocurrency's ecosystem.</summary>
