    <summary>In a recent discussion among experts on the potential risks to Bitcoin, Peter Todd emphasized the community's ability to address significant threats, including those posed by quantum computing. The conversation highlighted the potential for "ce qu'on ne voit pas" or unforeseen consequences, particularly with the rush to deploy quantum-proof ("PQ") secure wallets under a perceived emergency, which may still be vulnerable to classical attacks. The importance of traditional risk mitigation strategies, such as insurance against quantum threats for custodians, was noted as a prudent measure already in place for other forms of custody risks.

The dialog also delved into the trolley problem analogy applied to the development of Bitcoin's protocol, illustrating the complex ethical and practical dilemmas faced in securing the currency against quantum threats. One significant concern raised was the impact of rising electricity costs, denominated in Bitcoin, on miners. This scenario could lead to a vicious cycle where increased costs force miners to cease operations, reducing the block rate and thereby diminishing Bitcoin's value due to higher transaction fees and slower confirmation times. Such a scenario not only reduces profitability but may also encourage desperate attacks from miners with nothing left to lose, posing a non-specific but real threat to the network akin to challenges it might face after several more halving events or from other external pressures.

Moreover, the discussion acknowledged numerous uncertainties regarding the behavior of a quantum adversary, including the economic rationality of holding versus liquidating stolen Bitcoins, potential challenges in offloading stolen assets due to regulatory flagging, the variable impact of market fragmentation, and the predictability of the adversary's selling strategy. Concerns were also expressed about the inflexibility of demand for electricity from mining operations and whether a sudden price crash could be mitigated by market forces, highlighting a broad spectrum of open questions without clear answers.

Ultimately, the consensus underscored the need for a quantitative model to better understand the potential impact on miners and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem should a significant portion of coins be compromised by quantum capabilities. The exchange reflects a deep engagement with both the technical and economic dimensions of securing Bitcoin against evolving threats, underscoring the complexity of navigating such challenges in an uncertain future.</summary>
