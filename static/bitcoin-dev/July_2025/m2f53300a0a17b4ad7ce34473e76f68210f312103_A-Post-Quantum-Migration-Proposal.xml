    <summary>The discussion revolves around the significant threats posed by quantum computing to Bitcoin's security and its mining ecosystem. The conversation highlights a scenario where a potential quantum attack could have been executed, causing massive harm to the Bitcoin network. However, this was averted due to collaborative efforts within the community. The discourse delves into the concept of "ce qu'on ne voit pas" and the perverse incentives that a Quantum Day (Q-Day) might introduce, including the rushed development of purportedly quantum-proof wallets that may still be vulnerable to classic attacks. This raises concerns about the current preparedness for such quantum threats and the need for traditional insurance measures against quantum risks, similar to those already in place for pure custody risks.

The dialogue further explores the implications on Bitcoin miners, particularly how an increase in electricity costs denominated in Bitcoin could lead to unsustainable operations, prompting some miners to cease activities. This situation could decrease the block rate, increase transaction fees, and slow confirmation times, thereby reducing Bitcoin's perceived value and potentially initiating a negative feedback loop of loss-making mining operations. Furthermore, the possibility of mining attacks by desperate miners is acknowledged as a real threat, not unique to quantum advancements but also foreseeable following Bitcoin halving events or other external factors.

Concerns are raised about the economic rationality of a quantum adversary, the feasibility of liquidating a large quantity of stolen Bitcoins without being flagged, and the impact of market fragmentation on the uniformity of price drops across global Bitcoin markets. The discussion admits the uncertainty regarding the selling strategies of quantum adversaries, the inelastic demand from miners' electricity providers, and whether the market could quickly recover from a price crash through the actions of investors seizing a buying opportunity.

The email concludes with an acknowledgment of the serious concerns surrounding quantum threats to Bitcoin mining and the absence of a quantitative model to predict miners' responses to a scenario where a significant portion of coins is compromised by quantum capabilities. The sender expresses a desire for a more constructive, fact-based conversation, possibly facilitated by the development of a model to understand the impact on miners if approximately 20% of coins were affected by a quantum attack.</summary>
