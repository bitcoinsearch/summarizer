    <summary>In a recent discourse on the challenges posed by quantum computing to digital signature security, a novel solution termed "signature lifting" was introduced by Or and Shai Wyborski. This groundbreaking approach enables the transformation of existing quantum-insecure signature schemes into quantum-secure ones without the need for changing the current keys. The core principle behind signature lifting hinges on the utilization of a quantum-secure one-way function that effectively maps the seed (master secret key) to the public key. This method primarily leverages "Picnic," a sophisticated underlying primitive, to facilitate the conversion process. However, it's worth noting that this technique is not applicable to wallets created before 2013, which do not incorporate BIP-38, due to their reliance on a mapping function that isn't quantum-secure.

Or and Wyborski further explored an interactive transaction mechanism called "Lifted FawkesCoin," designed to mitigate the significant lengthening of signaturesâ€”a notable drawback of signature lifting. This enhanced version builds upon the original FawkesCoin concept by addressing transaction fees through the use of lifted signatures. In this system, transactions maintain their current size under honest conditions between the spender and miner, with the introduction of a long signature and financial penalties only when dishonesty is detected. This method necessitates periodic online checks from users for fraud attempts, suggesting a manageable trade-off for enhanced security against quantum threats.

The innovative approaches discussed in their work, documented in peer-reviewed papers ([link](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/362)) and presented at the PQC-SM Workshop 2023 ([link](https://www.qsmc.org/pqcsm-workshop-2023)), represent a potential Pareto improvement over existing strategies to counter quantum decryption capabilities. These developments reflect a significant step forward in the evolution of cryptographic practices, aiming to safeguard digital assets in the quantum computing era.</summary>
