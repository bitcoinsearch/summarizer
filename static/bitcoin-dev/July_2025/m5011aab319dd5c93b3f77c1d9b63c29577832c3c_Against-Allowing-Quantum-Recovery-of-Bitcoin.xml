    <summary>In the ongoing discourse on enhancing Bitcoin's security against quantum attacks, a novel solution has been introduced that diverges from the conventional "freeze" or "not-freeze" strategies. This new method is premised on the insight that while a quantum attacker may obtain a digital signature's private key, they typically lack access to the seed (master secret key) known only to the original key owner. This concept forms the core of an approach developed by Or and Shai Wyborski, detailed in their work which has undergone peer review and was showcased at the [PQC-SM Workshop 2023](https://www.qsmc.org/pqcsm-workshop-2023). Their technique, termed "signature lifting," aims to convert existing quantum-vulnerable signature schemes into quantum-resistant ones without changing the original keys. This is feasible through the use of a quantum-secure one-way function that maps the seed to the public key, though it is noted that this method is not applicable to wallets created before 2013 that do not utilize BIP-38 due to their reliance on non-quantum-secure mapping functions.

The underlying technology enabling this transformation is Picnic, as outlined in their reference ([ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3133956.3133997)). However, a significant limitation of signature lifting is the resultant increase in signature size. To mitigate this, an interactive transaction method named "Lifted FawkesCoin" was devised. This model builds upon the foundational FawkesCoin concept by Bonneau and Miller but introduces a solution for managing transaction fees with lifted signatures. In this system, transactions maintain their current size under honest conditions between the spender and miner. It is only when one party acts dishonestly that the larger signature is required to be added to the blockchain, incurring financial penalties for the deviating party. This mechanism necessitates that users periodically verify their account for fraudulent activities, suggesting a compromise that, despite its demands, represents an improvement over previous strategies by balancing security enhancements with practical usability concerns.</summary>
