    <summary>Jameson Lopp has introduced a debate on the freeze/not-freeze dilemma within the context of quantum computing's threat to digital signature schemes. A novel solution, developed by Or and Shai Wyborski, presents a third option that leverages a key asymmetry between a quantum attacker and the legitimate key owner: the owner's knowledge of the seed (master secret key), which the attacker does not possess. This insight forms the basis for their proposed technique, "signature lifting," which aims to transform quantum-insecure signature schemes into quantum-secure ones without changing the original keys. This method relies on the use of quantum-secure one-way functions to map the seed to the public key, ensuring security even in the face of quantum computational threats.

Or and Wyborski's work, detailed in their peer-reviewed paper available at [https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/362](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/362) and presented at the [PQC SM Workshop 2023](https://www.qsmc.org/pqcsm-workshop-2023), utilizes Picnic as the underlying quantum-secure primitive allowing for signature lifting. However, this approach introduces a significant drawback: the resultant signatures are considerably longer than current standards. To mitigate this issue, the researchers devised an interactive transaction method termed "Lifted FawkesCoin." This method is based on a commit-wait-reveal mechanism that maintains transaction sizes comparable to those of today under honest conditions. It only necessitates the inclusion of long signatures in the blockchain if one of the parties acts dishonestly, imposing a financial penalty on the cheating party.

Despite the potential inconvenience of users needing to periodically verify their accounts for fraud (suggested as potentially once a year), this method is seen as a Pareto improvement over the existing freeze and not-freeze options. It addresses the critical problem of transaction fees in quantum-secure transactions, building upon the original FawkesCoin concept by Bonneau and Miller, as detailed in [https://jbonneau.com/doc/BM14-SPW-fawkescoin.pdf](https://jbonneau.com/doc/BM14-SPW-fawkescoin.pdf). This innovative approach offers a promising path forward in securing digital transactions against the emerging threat posed by quantum computing.</summary>
