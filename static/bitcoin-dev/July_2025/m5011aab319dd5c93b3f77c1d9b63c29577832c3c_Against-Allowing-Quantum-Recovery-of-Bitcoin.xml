    <summary>Jameson Lopp introduced a discussion on the dilemma between freezing and not freezing digital assets in response to potential quantum attacks. This conversation opened up an exploration into alternative methods of securing digital signatures against quantum threats. A noteworthy contribution to this discourse is presented by Shai Wyborski and the author, who collaborated on a technique termed "signature lifting". This method aims to transform existing quantum-insecure signature schemes into quantum-secure ones without changing the original keys. It leverages a quantum-secure one-way function that maps the seed (master secret key) to the public key, making it possible to use old keys securely even under quantum threats. However, this approach does not apply to wallets created before the implementation of BIP-38 due to their reliance on non-quantum-secure one-way functions for mapping ECDSA signing keys to public keys.

The research, detailed in [their paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/362) and peer-reviewed at the [PQC-SM Workshop 2023](https://www.qsmc.org/pqcsm-workshop-2023), introduces Picnic as the underlying primitive facilitating the signature lifting process. Despite its innovative approach, signature lifting comes with the drawback of producing significantly longer signatures. To mitigate this issue, the authors devised "Lifted FawkesCoin", an interactive transaction method based on a commit-wait-reveal strategy. This concept builds upon the original FawkesCoin proposal by Bonneau and Miller, with the key improvement being a solution to manage transaction fees via lifted signatures. Lifted FawkesCoin ensures that transactions remain approximately the same size as current ones as long as both parties adhere to the protocol. Non-compliance results in the addition of the lengthy signature to the blockchain, penalizing the dishonest party financially.

An important aspect of transitioning to quantum-secure signatures through Lifted FawkesCoin is the requirement for users to periodically verify their account for fraud attempts, potentially once a year. Despite this added responsibility, the authors argue that their solution represents a Pareto improvement over existing alternatives by effectively balancing security enhancements against usability and practicality constraints.</summary>
