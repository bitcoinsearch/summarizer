    <summary>Jameson Lopp introduced a critical dilemma concerning the potential impact of quantum computing on digital signatures, specifically addressing the binary choice between freezing and not freezing cryptographic assets as a defensive measure against quantum attacks. A novel solution emerges from the work of Or and Shai Wyborski, which centers around the concept of "signature lifting." This technique aims to upgrade existing quantum-vulnerable signature schemes into quantum-secure ones without changing the original keys, leveraging a quantum-secure one-way function that maps the seed (master secret key) to the public key. This method notably sidesteps the limitations of pre-2013 wallets, which are incompatible due to their reliance on non-quantum-secure ECDSA signing keys and lack of BIP-38 implementation.

Their research, detailed in [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/362) and presented at the [PQC-SM Workshop 2023](https://www.qsmc.org/pqcsm-workshop-2023), utilizes Picnic, a post-quantum cryptographic primitive, as the foundation for the signature lifting process. Despite its innovative approach, signature lifting introduces a challenge: it significantly lengthens the signatures. To mitigate this issue, Or and Wyborski propose an interactive transaction method named "Lifted FawkesCoin," inspired by the original FawkesCoin concept but enhanced to handle transaction fees through the use of lifted signatures. This model ensures that transactions remain compact in size under honest conditions but imposes penalties on dishonest parties through the addition of lengthy signatures to the blockchain.

An important aspect of Lifted FawkesCoin is its requirement for users to periodically verify their accounts for fraudulent activities, suggesting an annual check as a preventive measure. Despite this additional responsibility placed on users, the authors argue that their solution represents a Pareto improvement over the existing alternatives, offering a more balanced approach to securing digital assets against quantum threats without necessitating the complete freezing or unfreezing of assets.</summary>
