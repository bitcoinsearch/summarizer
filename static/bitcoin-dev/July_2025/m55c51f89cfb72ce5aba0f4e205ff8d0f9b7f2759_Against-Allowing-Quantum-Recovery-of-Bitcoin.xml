    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, an interesting thought experiment was presented that explores the implications of quantum vulnerability on Bitcoin and proposes a novel approach to mitigating potential risks. The conversation delves into the distinction between freezing vulnerable Bitcoin outputs and outright confiscation, suggesting a method where transactions from quantum-vulnerable outputs (e.g., P2PK inputs) would only be allowed to produce similarly vulnerable outputs. This proposal aims to quarantine the risk by preventing these inherently insecure assets from interacting with and potentially compromising the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.

The argument posits that such a measure wouldn't constitute confiscation since the assets remain in the hands of their owners, albeit with restricted utility. This restriction effectively creates two distinct categories of Bitcoin: those that are quantum-resistant (and thus retain their value and utility) and those that are quantum-vulnerable (which could theoretically become worthless due to the risk of theft in the event of quantum computing breakthroughs). The inherent risk of theft by quantum computing means that quantum-vulnerable bitcoins could lose their function as secure property, instead serving as a potential inflationary force within the Bitcoin network by offering an advantage to entities possessing quantum computing capabilities.

Moreover, the discussion highlights a critical consideration regarding the acceptance and utility of quantum-vulnerable coins within the existing financial ecosystem. It questions the practicality of miners processing transactions with quantum-vulnerable fees, exchanges accepting such coins, or individuals agreeing to receive payments that carry a high risk of being retroactively stolen. The underlying concern is that without protective measures, quantum-vulnerable coins could undermine the value and security of the Bitcoin network.

One proposed solution to protect against such outcomes involves "freezing" these vulnerable outputs to prevent their theft, thereby safeguarding the integrity of quantum-resistant bitcoins. This approach is deemed minimally confiscatory since it aims to prevent loss rather than strip owners of their assets. Additionally, certain quantum-vulnerable outputs might still prove ownership through mechanisms like BIP-39 HD Seed proofs, offering a layer of protection for assets at risk.

This conversation underscores the complexities and challenges posed by quantum computing to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to secure digital assets against future technological advancements.</summary>
