    <summary>The debate on how to handle quantum vulnerability within Bitcoin transactions presents a nuanced perspective on the distinction between freezing assets and outright confiscation. A thought experiment suggests that limiting transactions from quantum-vulnerable outputs to only allow spending to other vulnerable outputs doesn't constitute confiscation. This approach would effectively create two distinct classes of Bitcoin: those susceptible to quantum attacks and thus deemed worthless, and those that are quantum-resistant and retain their value. Such a bifurcation underscores the inherent loss of value for quantum-vulnerable bitcoins in light of potential quantum computing threats. These vulnerable coins, if attacked, would not only lose their capacity as property but also serve as inflationary tools for quantum computer owners, thereby undermining the integrity and value of quantum-resistant coins.

This concept further highlights the practical challenges of integrating quantum-vulnerable coins within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Miners might reject transaction fees generated from these vulnerable outputs, and exchanges could refuse to accept such coins due to the risk of theft. Moreover, the willingness of individuals to accept quantum-vulnerable bitcoins as payment would likely diminish, given the heightened risk of these coins being stolen at a later date. The proposal to freeze quantum-vulnerable outputs rather than allowing them to circulate freely is posited as a protective measure. It aims to shield quantum-resistant bitcoins from potential devaluation caused by the inflationary impact of quantum attacks. This approach, especially when safeguarding outputs that can demonstrate ownership through BIP-39 HD Seed proofs, is viewed as a minimally confiscatory method that prevents theft while acknowledging the diminished utility and value of quantum-vulnerable bitcoins.</summary>
