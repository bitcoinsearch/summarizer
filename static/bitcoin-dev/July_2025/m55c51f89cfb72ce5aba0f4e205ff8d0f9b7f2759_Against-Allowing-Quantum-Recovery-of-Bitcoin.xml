    <summary>In a thought-provoking exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a discussion emerged regarding the implications of quantum computing on Bitcoin security and the potential measures to mitigate these risks. A notable contribution to this conversation was a proposal concerning the treatment of quantum-vulnerable Bitcoin outputs in the face of advancing quantum technology. The suggestion revolves around the idea of limiting transactions from quantum-vulnerable outputs (e.g., those originating from P2PK inputs) to only allow them to be sent to similarly vulnerable outputs. This approach aims to prevent the broader Bitcoin network from being affected by the inherent vulnerabilities associated with quantum computing.

The rationale behind this proposal is that it does not equate to confiscation of assets since the owners of quantum-vulnerable outputs can still operate within their ecosystem; however, it restricts their interaction with the quantum-resistant part of the network. This segregation would theoretically result in two distinct classes of Bitcoin: those that are quantum vulnerable and consequently deemed of lesser or no value due to their security flaws, and those that are quantum resistant and thus maintain their utility and worth. The premise is that quantum-vulnerable coins, in the advent of practical quantum computing capabilities, would lose their value as they could be easily targeted and stolen by individuals with access to such technology. Therefore, restricting these coins from interacting with the quantum-resistant segment of Bitcoin is seen as a way to reflect their diminished value while safeguarding the integrity and value of the quantum-resistant portion.

Furthermore, there's an acknowledgment of the potential for certain quantum-vulnerable outputs to prove ownership through BIP-39 HD Seed proofs, which could offer a method to protect these assets from theft. By freezing these vulnerable outputs, the proposal aims to prevent their unauthorized transfer, positioning this strategy as a non-confiscatory measure designed to protect the wider Bitcoin ecosystem from the inflationary pressures that could arise from quantum-induced thefts.

This discourse highlights the complexities and challenges faced by the Bitcoin community in addressing the potential threats posed by quantum computing. It also illustrates the ongoing efforts to preemptively craft solutions that balance security concerns with the principles of decentralization and user autonomy that underpin the cryptocurrency.</summary>
