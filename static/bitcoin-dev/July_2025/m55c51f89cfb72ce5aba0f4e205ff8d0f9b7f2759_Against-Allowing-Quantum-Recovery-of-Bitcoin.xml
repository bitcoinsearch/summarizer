    <summary>In the ongoing discussion about how to protect Bitcoin from quantum attacks, a novel idea was introduced that diverges from the notion of simply freezing vulnerable outputs. Instead, it proposes a system where transactions involving quantum-vulnerable inputs (e.g., P2PK inputs) are restricted to only generate quantum-vulnerable outputs. This approach aims to contain the risk within the quantum-vulnerable ecosystem without outright confiscation of assets. The underlying principle is that such assets, in the event of a quantum breakthrough, would inherently lose their value due to their susceptibility to theft. Therefore, this method seeks to prevent these compromised assets from adversely affecting the broader, quantum-resistant Bitcoin economy.

The proposition highlights a potential bifurcation of Bitcoin into two distinct categories: those that are quantum-vulnerable and thus, theoretically worthless, and those that are secured against quantum threats, retaining their value. This division stems from the practical considerations that miners, exchanges, and users would likely shun quantum-vulnerable coins due to the high risk of theft, rendering them essentially valueless. It's an acknowledgment that the value and security of Bitcoin in a post-quantum scenario hinge on its resistance to quantum decryption capabilities.

Moreover, this debate touches upon the technical feasibility of safeguarding certain quantum-vulnerable outputs through mechanisms like BIP-39 HD Seed proofs, which could verify ownership without exposing these assets to theft. Such measures are viewed as less aggressive than outright freezing, as they aim to protect rather than confiscate, reflecting a nuanced approach to maintaining Bitcoin's integrity in the face of quantum computing advancements. This discourse underlines the complexity of ensuring Bitcoin's resilience to quantum threats and the need for solutions that balance security with the principles of property and value within the cryptocurrency space.</summary>
