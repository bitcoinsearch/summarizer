    <summary>Ethan Heilman raises a critical point in the discussion regarding the security of cryptocurrency assets against quantum computing threats, emphasizing the necessity for proactive measures within the Bitcoin community. Heilman argues that relying on the status quo or failing to act against potential quantum computing risks could have dire consequences for the ecosystem. The notion of "quantum sovereignty" is challenged by the reality that without protective actions, assets may be as vulnerable to quantum attacks as they are to conventional thefts and confiscations, which often occur without prior warning. This perspective underlines the urgency of developing and implementing strategies to safeguard assets before threats materialize.

Heilman suggests that a possible approach to mitigate these risks involves freezing funds identified as vulnerable to quantum attacks, albeit acknowledging that this measure might temporarily restrict access for some users. However, he is optimistic about the development of quantum-safe recovery methods, advocating for ongoing research and dialogue to evaluate various proposals and their respective trade-offs. The ultimate goal highlighted is to encourage a widespread transition within the cryptocurrency ecosystem towards quantum-resistant practices and technologies. 

Moreover, Heilman points out the slow pace at which Bitcoin consensus evolves, suggesting that waiting for a unanimous agreement on a recovery scheme could be impractical. Instead, he proposes incentivizing the community to adopt preemptive measures against quantum vulnerabilities. This approach aims not only to protect individual assets but also to preserve the integrity and trustworthiness of the entire Bitcoin network.</summary>
