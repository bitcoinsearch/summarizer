    <summary>Ethan Heilman's communication stresses the importance of proactive measures in securing Bitcoin against potential quantum threats. He critiques the idea of not taking action due to fears of fund confiscation as short-sighted, highlighting that both centralized authority confiscations and thefts by malicious actors occur without warning, essentially leaving victims with no recourse. Heilman argues for the necessity of freezing funds vulnerable to quantum attacks as a temporary measure, acknowledging the risks of locking some individuals out of their assets but emphasizing that this could be mitigated through the development of quantum-safe recovery schemes. 

He advocates for further research and discussions on these recovery methods to evaluate the trade-offs of various proposals effectively. The underlying motive for exploring such a scenario is the slow pace at which Bitcoin consensus evolves, paired with the belief that preparation is better than inaction, especially given the potentially catastrophic impact of quantum attacks on unprepared digital assets. Heilman suggests that incentivizing the entire ecosystem to migrate towards quantum-resistant solutions would be ideal to avoid the complexities of reaching a consensus on specific recovery schemes. This approach aims at ensuring the security of funds against quantum vulnerabilities without necessitating a consensus on how to recover them if they are compromised.</summary>
