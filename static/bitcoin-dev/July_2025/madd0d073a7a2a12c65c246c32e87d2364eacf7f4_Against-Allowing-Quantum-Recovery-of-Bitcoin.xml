    <summary>Ethan Heilman raises a critical point in the ongoing debate about quantum sovereignty within the Bitcoin ecosystem. He argues that while some may view the idea of confiscating funds through a fork as a form of theft, the real concern should be about preparing for potential threats from quantum computing. He suggests that failing to act could leave the entire system vulnerable, making the notion of theft by centralized authorities or bad actors a secondary issue since such entities typically don't provide advance notice before compromising funds.

Heilman believes that freezing funds at risk from quantum attacks doesn't necessarily mean permanent loss for the owners. Instead, he sees it as an opportunity to develop and implement quantum-safe recovery schemes. The need for more research and discussion around these proposals is evident, as they will play a crucial role in securing the ecosystem against quantum threats. He emphasizes the slow pace at which Bitcoin consensus evolves and suggests that proactively preparing for quantum vulnerabilities is far more sensible than doing nothing.

Ultimately, Heilman advocates for incentivizing the entire Bitcoin ecosystem to migrate towards quantum-resistant measures. However, he acknowledges the challenge in reaching consensus on a quantum safe recovery scheme, which might be necessary to protect funds from quantum attacks effectively. His message underscores the importance of forward-thinking and collaboration in the face of emerging technological threats to the cryptocurrency space.</summary>
