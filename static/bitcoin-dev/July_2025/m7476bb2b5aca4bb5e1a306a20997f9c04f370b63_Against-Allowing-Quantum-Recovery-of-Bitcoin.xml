    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the nuanced perspective that the primary quantum-related threat to Bitcoin is not necessarily the emergence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC), but rather the widespread belief in its imminent development and potential impact. This concern stems from the anticipation that fear alone, regarding the possibility of a CRQC's existence, could significantly influence Bitcoin's stability before any real technological advancements manifest. The argument presented suggests that even with the introduction of quantum-safe outputs, there might not be sufficient incentive for Bitcoin holders to transition their assets, thus leaving a substantial amount of Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attacks. This vulnerability is attributed to various factors, including disbelief in the feasibility of CRQCs, compatibility issues with existing use cases, reluctance to adopt necessary changes due to other priorities such as altcoin infrastructure development, and the existence of lost coins which cannot be moved.

Furthermore, the text highlights that major ecosystem players currently lack the capability to engage with newer, potentially more secure technologies like taproot outputs, underscoring the ecosystem's slow adaptation to emerging threats. The persistence of CRQC-vulnerable coins within the system, therefore, poses an ongoing existential risk, primarily due to the potential sell pressure from fear of CRQC exploitation. This scenario includes fears of market crashes triggered by quantum attackers liquidating stolen Bitcoin, further exacerbating sell-off pressures among holders.

To address this looming threat effectively, the communication proposes that efforts should extend beyond just developing and advocating for quantum-resistant technologies. It suggests that a crucial mitigation strategy could involve the potential freezing of CRQC-vulnerable coins, rendering them inaccessible to quantum attacks. This preventative measure would require extensive groundwork, including research, proposal, activation, and promotion of quantum-safe outputs as initial steps. However, without the subsequent action to disable quantum-vulnerable outputs, these preparatory activities might not suffice to counteract the overarching threat posed by the public's fear of quantum computing capabilities.
