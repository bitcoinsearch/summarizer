    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion highlights a nuanced perspective on the potential threats quantum computing poses to Bitcoin, focusing not on the actual advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) but rather on the perception and belief surrounding their imminent existence. The argument made is that the fear of CRQCs could precede their actual development and have a more immediate and profound impact on Bitcoin's stability and security. This concern is rooted in the fact that the availability of quantum-safe outputs alone might not be sufficient to prompt the majority of Bitcoin holders to transition their holdings, thereby leaving a significant portion of Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum attacks.

Several reasons are cited for the possible reluctance among Bitcoin holders to move their assets to quantum-safe outputs. These include disbelief in the eventual creation of CRQCs, compatibility issues with existing use cases such as a lack of support for BIP32-like structures, key aggregation, thresholds, or the outputs being too large for certain applications. Additionally, some stakeholders may prioritize more profitable activities, like building infrastructure for alternative cryptocurrencies, over implementing necessary precautions against quantum threats. The problem is exacerbated by lost coins which cannot be moved, further ensuring that a portion of Bitcoin remains at risk.

The persistence of CRQC-vulnerable coins within the system, according to the discussion, could maintain a perpetual existential threat to Bitcoin due to the potential selling pressure from stolen coins if a CRQC were to become operational. This fear could lead to market instability, even among those who have secured their assets in quantum-safe outputs, due to concerns over an exchange-rate crash triggered by the liquidation of compromised coins.

In conclusion, the conversation suggests that mitigating the fear of quantum threats may ultimately require more drastic measures than simply promoting the adoption of quantum-safe outputs. It proposes that a significant part of addressing these concerns would involve the capability to freeze CRQC-vulnerable coins, implying that while the development and endorsement of quantum-resistant technologies are crucial preparatory steps, they might not suffice without the ability to invalidate susceptible outputs. This stance underscores the complexity of securing Bitcoin against emerging quantum computing capabilities and the importance of considering both technological solutions and the psychological dimensions of security threats.</summary>
