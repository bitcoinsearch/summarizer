    <summary>The central concern raised pertains to the potential impact of the belief in the imminent development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) on Bitcoin, rather than the actual creation of such machines. This perspective emphasizes that the anticipation or fear of CRQCs could have significant effects before any real threat materializes. The discussion further argues that simply introducing quantum-safe outputs may not adequately address these concerns. Various reasons are cited for this skepticism, including a lack of motivation among coin holders to transition their assets, compatibility issues with current use cases, and the neglect of necessary upgrades due to other priorities, such as developing more profitable altcoin infrastructure. Additionally, the problem of lost coins, which are unlikely to ever be moved to quantum-safe outputs, is highlighted as a factor that could prevent the complete elimination of CRQC-vulnerable coins from the market.

The narrative also explores the potential economic repercussions stemming from the fear of CRQCs, including sell pressure on Bitcoin and the possibility of an exchange-rate crash triggered by the hypothetical sale of stolen coins by a CRQC operator. This scenario suggests that even those who have secured their assets in quantum-safe outputs might still face financial uncertainty due to broader market reactions.

In conclusion, the text posits that the real solution to mitigating both the actual and perceived threats of quantum computing to Bitcoin lies in the ability to freeze CRQC-vulnerable coins. It acknowledges that while creating and promoting quantum-safe outputs are crucial initial steps, they may ultimately prove insufficient without the capability to disable vulnerable outputs. This approach would aim to directly confront the existential threat posed by both the fear and the potential reality of CRQC advancements.
