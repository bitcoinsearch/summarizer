    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion begins with the assertion that the primary quantum-related threat to Bitcoin is not necessarily the emergence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) itself but rather the public's belief in the imminent arrival of such technology. This perspective suggests that the fear and speculation surrounding the development of CRQCs could have a more immediate and significant impact on Bitcoin than the actual realization of quantum computing capabilities capable of compromising Bitcoin's cryptographic security.

Further exploration into this topic reveals concerns regarding the effectiveness of quantum-safe outputs as a mitigating factor against the quantum threat. The argument presented is that simply having quantum-safe outputs available might not be enough to encourage the majority of Bitcoin holders to transfer their assets into these secure forms. Various reasons are cited for potential reluctance, including disbelief in the eventual creation of CRQCs, compatibility issues with existing use cases (such as the lack of support for BIP32-like features, key aggregation, thresholds, or size constraints), and a focus on developing more profitable alternative cryptocurrency infrastructures. There is also an acknowledgment of the irrelevance of this solution for lost coins, which cannot be transferred to quantum-safe outputs.

Moreover, it is suggested that without significant adoption of quantum-safe outputs, the continued presence of CRQC-vulnerable coins within the system could sustain existential fears among Bitcoin stakeholders. This apprehension may lead to sell-offs prompted by the worry of exchange-rate crashes resulting from potential actions by CRQC operators, such as selling stolen coins. This scenario illustrates how the mere possibility of quantum computing advancements could exert considerable pressure on the Bitcoin market, independent of any real technological breakthroughs.

The communication concludes with the proposition that addressing the fear of quantum threats may ultimately require more drastic measures than just promoting quantum-safe outputs. It is posited that the effective mitigation of quantum concerns might involve freezing CRQC-vulnerable coins, suggesting that steps toward implementing quantum-safe solutions should be viewed as preparatory actions in anticipation of more definitive protective measures in the future. This stance advocates for a proactive approach to the quantum threat, emphasizing the need for both immediate action in developing quantum-resistant technologies and longer-term strategies to safeguard the integrity of cryptocurrencies against quantum vulnerabilities.</summary>
