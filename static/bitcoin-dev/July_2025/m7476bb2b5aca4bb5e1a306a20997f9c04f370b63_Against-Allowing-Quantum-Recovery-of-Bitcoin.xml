    <summary>The discourse presents a nuanced perspective on the potential quantum-related threats to Bitcoin, emphasizing that the fear of the emergence of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) poses a more immediate threat than the actual realization of such technology. This argument hinges on the belief and anticipation of CRQC development rather than its physical existence. The discussion points out that the mere availability of quantum-safe outputs may not be enough to mitigate this fear-driven threat effectively. This is attributed to several factors including the reluctance or inability of coin holders to transition their assets to these safer outputs due to disbelief in the CRQC threat, compatibility issues, or other priorities such as developing more profitable altcoin infrastructure. Furthermore, it highlights that a significant portion of coins may never be moved due to being lost, thereby remaining vulnerable to potential quantum attacks.

Moreover, the text argues that despite the introduction of quantum-safe outputs, the persistent presence of CRQC-vulnerable coins could sustain existential fears, primarily driven by concerns over market stability. Such fears could be exacerbated by the possibility of a QRQC operator exploiting these vulnerabilities to steal and sell off large quantities of Bitcoin, potentially crashing the exchange rate and inducing further sell-offs. The author suggests that a more effective mitigation strategy against the quantum threat might involve the freezing of CRQC-vulnerable coins, positing that steps towards investigating, proposing, activating, and advocating for the adoption of quantum-safe outputs are merely preparatory actions. These efforts, although necessary, may ultimately fall short of addressing the core issue without additional measures to disable quantum-vulnerable outputs.

In essence, the conversation calls for a reconsideration of the current strategies to protect Bitcoin from potential quantum computing threats, underlining the importance of addressing both the technological vulnerabilities and the psychological impacts associated with the anticipation of such advancements. The inclusion of a link ([Bitcoin exchanges are now the enemy](https://rusty.ozlabs.org/2020/05/27/bitcoin-exchanges-are-now-the-enemy.html)) serves to illustrate the complexities and challenges within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly concerning the adaptation to emerging threats and the evolving landscape of digital currency exchanges.</summary>
