    <summary>In order to prevent a network partition on August 1st, it is crucial for BIP-148 nodes to connect with at least two other BIP-148 nodes. To facilitate this, a temporary service bit (1) has been introduced to allow these nodes to detect each other and ease the transition to BIP148 while minimizing risks in case miners choose to perform a chain split attack. Bitcoin Knots, a Bitcoin software implementation, will be using this service bit, and other software implementing BIP148 are encouraged to do the same. Once the transition is complete, returning the bit for reuse will no longer be necessary.Luke Dashjr, a developer of Bitcoin Knots, has recommended that other software implementing BIP148 should set and use the service bit (1) to avoid network partitioning risks. This recommendation aims to ease the transition to BIP148 and minimize risks in the event of a chain split attack. The temporary service bit will be used until the transition is complete, after which it will be manually returned for reuse. Tom Zander, another developer, inquired about what action can be taken when encountering a peer with or without the set bit and requested the Github commit link where the implementation was done. The discussion regarding this matter took place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.Bitcoin Knots' decision to utilize the temporary service bit (1) is part of their efforts to facilitate the transition to BIP148 and minimize the potential risks associated with a chain split attack by signaling readiness for Segregated Witness (SegWit). SegWit is a proposed protocol upgrade aimed at increasing Bitcoin's block size limit. By using the service bit (1), Bitcoin Knots nodes running version 0.14.2 or later will only accept blocks that signal readiness for SegWit. This measure helps ensure that the network remains unified and does not split into separate chains.The introduction of SegWit has sparked controversy within the Bitcoin community, with some supporting it as a necessary step for scalability, while others have concerns about centralization and the potential impact on network decentralization. Despite this, many Bitcoin businesses and users have shown their support for SegWit by activating the BIP91 proposal, which provides a way for miners to activate SegWit without causing a chain split.Bitcoin Knots' decision to use the service bit (1) to signal readiness for SegWit is seen as a positive step in ensuring a smooth transition to the proposed protocol upgrade. It also serves as a reminder to other Bitcoin software implementations to take similar measures to prevent a chain split and maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin network. By adopting these precautions, the Bitcoin community aims to minimize risks and ensure the successful implementation of BIP148 and SegWit.</summary>
