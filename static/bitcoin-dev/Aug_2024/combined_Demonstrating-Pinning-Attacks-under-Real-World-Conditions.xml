    <summary>Antoine Riard has initiated a conversation regarding the setup and requirements for volunteers interested in conducting real-world pinning attacks against production lightning nodes. He suggests creating a public page outlining the necessary steps and configurations for volunteers, addressing specific concerns such as the current and default installations of Core/btcd alongside lnd/cln/ldk, the significance of channel amounts, the number of channels needed, preferences for certain types of channels, and whether volunteers should establish channels amongst themselves. Further inquiries include the relevance of network topology and the use of network connectivity features like Tor. This discussion takes place within a broader context of exploring security vulnerabilities in the bitcoin network, particularly focusing on cross-layer attacks targeting lightning nodes.

The ongoing dialogue underscores the importance of investigating and understanding the implications of such security exploits, despite challenges in demonstrating these attacks. A notable aspect of this endeavor is the mention of a donation to the OpenTimestamps (OTS) project, emphasizing its value in securely timestamping digital information on the blockchain. The reluctance among developers to engage in demonstrations of vulnerabilities highlights the complexity and risks involved in exposing live environments to potential threats. However, there is a call for more active participation in these security assessments, suggesting an optimistic future for improving the evaluation of bitcoin security flaws by adopting practices from major information security conferences.

Antoine outlines his commitment to not interfere with CPU or RAM functionalities during the tests but focuses on transaction-relay and mempool logic. He offers compensation should significant issues arise and expresses his intention to run a node on the mainnet for liquidity rebalancing, pledging to supply the necessary liquidity himself. His support for OTS is further shown through a promised donation. Additionally, Riard ensures specific scenarios are handled using the latest valid commitment state to avoid penalties associated with justice transactions.

Permission is granted for attack tests on Riard's Lightning node, part of the Alice OpenTimestamps calendar, until October 1st. The operational parameters and capacities of the node are detailed, along with instructions for testers to minimize disruptions and compensate for any incurred expenses. Riard encourages a net donation to the OTS community post-testing. The communication includes references to Peter Todd's website for further reading.

Building on Dave Harding's suggestion, Antoine advocates for setting up "free-to-pwn" lightning nodes on the mainnet to facilitate the demonstration of sophisticated cross-layer attacks. This initiative aims to provide a realistic testing environment distinct from private regtest or testnet setups. By enabling public demonstrations, Antoine seeks to highlight the complexities and vulnerabilities inherent in the Bitcoin ecosystem, urging a transparent assessment of protocol security. His message emphasizes the importance of public verifiability in assessing the safety and reliability of blockchain technologies, critiquing certain industry figures for potentially misleading the community about the robustness of the protocol and the economic viability of Lightning Service Providers. Further resources and discussions related to this topic are accessible via the Linux Foundation's mailing list archive.</summary>
