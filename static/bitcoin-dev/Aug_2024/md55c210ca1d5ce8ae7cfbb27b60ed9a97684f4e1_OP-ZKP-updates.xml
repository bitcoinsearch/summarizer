    <summary>The recent communication sheds light on a promising solution to a previously discussed issue related to open application circuits. The proposed method centers around the concept of recursive verification, which significantly simplifies the process by eliminating the need to publish each application circuit's verification key on-chain. Instead, this approach advocates for the implementation of a singular circuit that the OP_ZKP will verify through recursion.

This innovative strategy is further detailed and made accessible to interested parties through a dedicated GitHub organization created for OP_ZKP, which can be found at [https://github.com/opzkp](https://github.com/opzkp). Additionally, a repository named "tea-horse" has been established to serve as a platform for sharing high-level ideas and developments related to this solution. Although currently in its infancy with limited content, the repository is expected to evolve and be enriched with more information and resources as progress is made. The creator encourages readers to visit both links to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and contribute to the ongoing development efforts.</summary>
