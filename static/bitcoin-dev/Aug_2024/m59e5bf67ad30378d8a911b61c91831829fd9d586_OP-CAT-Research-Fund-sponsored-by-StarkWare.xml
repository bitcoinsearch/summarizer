    <summary>StarkWare has launched an initiative offering a $1 million bounty for well-argued perspectives on the activation of OP_CAT. This endeavor is managed by a committee comprising notable figures, including Andrew Poelstra from Blockstream as the Chair and Victor Kolobov from StarkWare as the Secretary General, among others from reputable organizations such as Chaincode, BastionZero, Lightning Labs, and ZeroSync.

The goal behind this bounty is to engage the community in contributing thoughtful arguments that either support or oppose the activation of OP_CAT. The areas of interest specified for these discussions encompass a variety of topics. These include the potential security implications that the activation of OP_CAT might have on Bitcoin, the capabilities and innovations it could bring to computing and locking script logic on Bitcoinâ€™s platform, and its usefulness in applications and protocols developed on Bitcoin. Furthermore, the committee is also interested in general research regarding OP_CAT and its overall impact on the ecosystem.

Individuals interested in participating and contributing their insights into this significant discourse are encouraged to submit their proposals through the provided link: [Apply here](https://starkware.co/submission-proposals/). This initiative not only opens up a platform for critical analysis and debate but also emphasizes the importance of community-driven research and discussion in shaping the future dynamics of Bitcoin's technological advancements.</summary>
