    <summary>The discussion revolves around the intricacies of block withholding in cryptocurrency mining and the significance of custom work selection by miners. The key argument posits that irrespective of whether every share is fully validated, detecting block withholding necessitates statistical analysis due to inherent limitations. This introduces a scenario where, despite potential non-payment by pools, miners continue their work on preferred blocks. The autonomy in work selection ensures that miners engage with blocks of their choosing, highlighting an essential aspect of the mining process. If a miner successfully mines a block, they have the capability to broadcast it independently.

Furthermore, the dialogue touches upon the adaptability of mining pools and the potential for policy changes regarding mining procedures. Such changes would require miners to actively alter their preferences in mining operations. The conversation also counters skepticism regarding the sustainability of pools that fail to compensate adequately. It suggests a natural progression towards the formation of new pools that prioritize fair payment practices, indicating a self-regulating aspect within the mining community. This perspective underscores the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency mining ecosystems and the potential for evolution in response to the behaviors and expectations of miners.</summary>
