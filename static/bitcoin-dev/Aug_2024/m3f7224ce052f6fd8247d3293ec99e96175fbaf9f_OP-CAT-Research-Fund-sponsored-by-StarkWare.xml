    <summary>StarkWare has launched a significant initiative, offering a $1 million bounty for persuasive arguments that either support or challenge the activation of OP_CAT. This effort is guided by a committee comprised of notable members from various organizations, including Andrew Poelstra of Blockstream as Chair and Victor Kolobov from StarkWare serving as Secretary General, among others from Chaincode, BastionZero, Lightning Labs, ZeroSync, and StarkWare itself.

The primary goal behind this bounty is to engage the community in a comprehensive discussion regarding OP_CAT's potential effects on Bitcoin. The topics of interest for this debate include the security implications that may arise from activating OP_CAT, how OP_CAT-based computing and locking script logic could impact Bitcoin, as well as the applications and protocols that might utilize OP_CAT. Additionally, general research surrounding OP_CAT and its influence on Bitcoin is also encouraged. Those interested in contributing to this dialogue are invited to submit their proposals through the provided [submission link](https://starkware.co/submission-proposals/). This initiative not only highlights StarkWare's commitment to fostering a deeper understanding of OP_CAT but also underscores the importance of community involvement in shaping the future of Bitcoin's technological landscape.</summary>
