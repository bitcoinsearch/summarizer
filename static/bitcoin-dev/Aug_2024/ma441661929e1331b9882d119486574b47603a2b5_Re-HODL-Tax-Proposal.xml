    <summary>The ongoing situation regarding network users who retain their coins without contributing to the network's value has sparked significant discussion. The concern revolves around the impact on miners, especially in the aftermath of halving events, which tend to reduce their rewards. An innovative proposal suggests imposing fees on those users who choose not to transact with their coins. This approach aims to incentivize coin movement, thereby supporting miners through increased transaction fees, which could enhance the overall security of the network. A detailed exploration of this proposal has been compiled and is accessible for further review.</summary>
