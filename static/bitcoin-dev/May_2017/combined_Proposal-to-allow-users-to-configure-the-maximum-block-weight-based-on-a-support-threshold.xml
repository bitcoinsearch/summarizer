    <summary>On May 23, 2017, Tomas van der Wansem proposed a mechanism on bitcoin-dev that would allow users to configure their own maximum block weight at a support threshold. The purpose of this proposal is to provide users with the freedom to choose their parameters while still maintaining coordination of any changes. It should be noted that this proposal does not give more power to miners nor reduce decentralization.Erik Aronesty further suggests using UTXO bits instead of block thresholds to coordinate size changes. This provides an optional way to synchronize changes without the need for off-chain agreements. It is seen as a simple improvement over the current situation.The proposal emphasizes that miners cannot change the block size or any other rule without the support of the users. This is because their blocks and coins would be rejected if they go against the consensus. Without the proposed mechanism, someone could manipulate a miner into believing that 99% of nodes are ready for a larger weight, even if that is not true.The user agent signaling, according to Erik, is not very important. It is widely recognized that counting them cannot be relied upon. Therefore, the proposal focuses on allowing users to configure their own maximum block weight, giving them the authority to set their parameters while still ensuring coordination.The complete proposal can be found on Github under the BIP-changing-the-maximum-block weight-based-on-a-support-threshold.mediawiki. It is designed to prevent off-chain debates and maintain coordination among users. Miners still rely on their blocks being accepted by economic nodes to sell their minted coins, and this proposal does not alter that relationship.</summary>
