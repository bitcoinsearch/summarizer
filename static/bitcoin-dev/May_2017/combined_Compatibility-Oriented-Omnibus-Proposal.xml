    <summary>In a Bitcoin-dev email thread, concerns were raised about the compatibility of LukeJr's suggested 2MB cap with the NY agreement. Users questioned the reasoning behind this decision and suggested incorporating a gradual blocksize increase beyond the initial 2MB cap to satisfy the conditions of the Scaling Agreement. The purpose of the Omnibus Proposal is to achieve the goals of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement while preventing chain-split risks. The proposal sets automatic hard fork rules once SegWit is activated and calls upon the developers of the Segwit2x Team to consider and honor the Omnibus Proposal.There is controversy over including a secondary limit on the block size increase in the segwit + 2mb agreement. Users expect a linear increase in block size when the Base Size is increased to 2000000 bytes and Total Weight is increased to 8000000 bytes. Jared suggests that hard data is needed to justify the secondary limitation or it should be left out in favor of a transaction size limit. Shaolin Fry's &quot;Mandatory activation of segwit deployment&quot; is included to cause the existing &quot;segwit&quot; deployment to activate without needing to release a new deployment. However, this may cause more controversy due to tight timelines and specific signaling requirements.Calvin Rechner believes that incorporating Luke-Jr's 2MB limit and discount-rebalancing would satisfy the conditions of the Scaling Agreement while ensuring maximum safety, minimum code discrepancies, and minimum controversy among the community. He suggests a gradual increase to a larger size cap to achieve cooperation between the community, industry, and developers. The Omnibus Proposal guarantees a successful SegWit activation followed by a hard fork and represents compatibility with existing deployment approaches.The Compatibility-Oriented Omnibus Proposal aims to achieve the goals of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement by minimizing disruption and loss potential. It suggests phasing in a gradual blocksize increase beyond the initial 2MB cap and committing to unity to prevent chain-split risks. The proposal ensures a successful SegWit activation followed by a hard fork, enforcing legacy consensus compatibility until the specified block height. It is designed to serve as a template for achieving true consensus in the Bitcoin community.The current situation in the Bitcoin community involves multiple proposals and potential hard forks. The xkcd comic &quot;Standards&quot; illustrates the problem with having too many competing standards. One potential fork, a rapid 2MB+Segwit hard fork coin, has the potential to fragment the network if not enacted unanimously. BIP148 in Core seems necessary to defend against attacks. LukeJr's proposed 2MB block size hardfork may also become controversial. Oliver Petruzel seeks an explanation for this unexpected outcome.There is a proposal for a 2MB block size hardfork in the Bitcoin community. Experts suggest it as the best way to implement this change, as long as it is adopted unanimously. A block size limit will need to be imposed to enforce the new block size and ensure smooth network operation. The proposal aims to fulfill the commitments of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement.The proposal suggests combining several constituent proposals into a single omnibus proposal and patch set. It plans to activate SegWit at an 80% signaling threshold while also activating a 2MB hard fork within six months. It incorporates protectionary measures to ensure a safe fork activation. The proposal assumes genuine commitment from the signatories of the Scaling Agreement and aims to remain compatible with future network updates.The Compatibility-oriented Omnibus Proposal is an attempt to combine multiple proposals and achieve the goals of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement. It includes various activation options to prevent delays and maximize compatibility. The proposal links the activation of SegWit with a later hard fork block size increase. It imposes a legacy witness discount and a 2MB blocksize limit to ensure a safe fork activation. It is designed to unite the Bitcoin community under a common front.The proposal aims to fulfill the commitments of the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement by combining several proposals into a single patch set. It includes activation options and protectionary measures to ensure safe fork activation. Although not likely to be merged into Bitcoin Core immediately, it is written with compatibility in mind. The proposal assumes commitment from the signatories of the agreement and aims to achieve true consensus.Overall, the Bitcoin development community is active and engaged, with various platforms for discussion and collaboration. The proposal provides an opportunity for cooperation and unity while minimizing risks. The availability of resources such as mailing lists and public forums contributes to ongoing innovation in the field of cryptocurrency.</summary>
