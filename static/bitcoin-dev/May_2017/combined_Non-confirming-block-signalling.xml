    <summary>On May 5, 2017, Tomas proposed a method to mark blocks indicating that they were generated without verifying the previous block by using a bit of the version field. This proposal aims to address the issue of reduced security caused by SPV-mining. Bryan Bishop responded to the proposal, acknowledging that it had been previously discussed in a Bitcoin-dev mailing list post from December 2015, which he provided a link to. Tomas's suggestion involves utilizing a specific bit in the version field to indicate blocks that were generated without verifying the previous block. By implementing this marking system, the potential risks associated with SPV-mining can be mitigated. It is important to note that the idea had already been discussed in a Bitcoin-dev mailing list post in December 2015, and Bryan Bishop shared the link to this discussion.In addition to the proposal and the reference to the earlier discussion, Bryan included his contact information in his email signature. His personal website, heybryan.org, was provided along with his phone number. This information allows for further communication and collaboration on the topic.For more detailed information about the proposal, including the full proposal document and related discussions, the BIP can be found on Tomas's GitHub page.</summary>
