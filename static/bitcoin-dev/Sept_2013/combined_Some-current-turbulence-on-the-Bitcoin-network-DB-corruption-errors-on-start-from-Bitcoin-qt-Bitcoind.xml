    <summary>A helpful write-up on the BitcoinTalk forum provides step-by-step instructions for users looking for a workaround on Windows. The workaround is specific to the Windows operating system and caution should be exercised when making changes to system settings. Gregory Maxwell, a Bitcoin developer, has a patch available for review regarding the cryptocurrency's blockchain vulnerability. The patch can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2982 and more information will be provided once it has been fully reviewed by other developers. Until then, Maxwell suggests using the checklevel=2 workaround as a temporary solution. Passengers are advised to return to their seats and fasten their seat-belts as all Bitcoin-qt / Bitcoind nodes are currently experiencing an issue. After restarting, nodes report "coin database inconsistencies found" and prompt users with "Do you want to rebuild the block database now?" Reindexing will not solve this issue, which was introduced by version 0.8.0. However, it is only local and does not carry any forking risk. To work around this problem, users should specify the command-line or configuration file argument -checklevel=2 to Bitcoind or Bitcoin-qt. This issue will persist until no more than 288 blocks after 256818, unless another trigger transaction is added to the blockchain. A patch will be released soon to fix the problem completely.</summary>
