    <summary>In September 2013, Matt Corallo announced the release of version 0.8.5 of Bitcoin, after a delay for which he apologized. This new version included a new category and could be downloaded from the Bitcoin Github repository. Kip Warner, a software engineer, expressed gratitude to Matt for the update and shared his contact information, with a preference for OpenPGP encrypted/signed mail.Following this, Kip Warner proposed refining the "Office" category in the bitcoin-qt application's XDG desktop integration to "Finance" in a mailing list post. He pointed out that XDG's menu specification allowed for such a modification. Although acknowledging his limited knowledge of Git, he suggested modifying the line in bitcoin-qt.desktop to read "Categories=Office;Finance;" However, he did not provide a patch himself.In response, Matt announced the pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2999, which included the implementation of the new category. The discussion regarding this change took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.The bitcoin-qt application's XDG desktop integration currently places itself under the "Office" menu category on certain desktop environments. However, there is a suggestion to refine this categorization to "Finance" based on XDG's menu specification. This would allow for a more specific classification. The proposed modification to the bitcoin-qt.desktop file is to include the line "Categories=Office;Finance." The author of the proposal apologized for not providing the patch himself due to his limited knowledge of Git.</summary>
