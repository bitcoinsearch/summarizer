    <summary>The Trsst project is focused on enabling content monetization through micro payments of digital crypto-currency. Each user account on the platform functions as a digital wallet, allowing authors to receive payments whenever their content is consumed, shared, or liked. In an effort to make Bitcoin more user-friendly, Wendell suggests the idea of watermarking addresses into social network profile pictures to connect them to personal profiles. This would enable users to send Bitcoin to any Facebook user who has configured their profile correctly.To implement this approach, a Java library exists that can implement watermarking capable of surviving social network recompression. However, due to Facebook's lack of support for most apps, many have disappeared over time. Despite this, Blockchain.info offers the ability to send 'coin via Facebook, and Bitcoins With Friends is another available option.A potential solution to watermarking images on social media platforms is suggested: creating a mobile app with API access to read and write the user's profile picture. This would allow the app to periodically check if the image has changed and rewatermark and reupload the highest resolution available. However, this manual process may not be suitable for everyone and could result in the loss of comments or likes on the primary photo or lead to duplicates. The ability to read the user's watermarked address does not require API access or an account. It is recommended to encode a short URL containing a payment request rather than using an actual Bitcoin address or key, as social network photos have limited stegod data capacity due to compression. Users would also need to rotate their key periodically at the hosting site.Mike Hearn proposed the idea of watermarking images with Bitcoin addresses to establish connections between social networking profiles without the need for API access. Although the process would be manual and undone every time a user changes their profile image, it could still serve as a useful way to organize Bitcoin around people and organizations in a familiar manner. While most apps have vanished due to Facebook's lack of support, Blockchain.info offers the option to send 'coin via Facebook, and Bitcoins With Friends is another available choice. The thread is open for discussion on additional ideas to simplify Bitcoin usage.</summary>
