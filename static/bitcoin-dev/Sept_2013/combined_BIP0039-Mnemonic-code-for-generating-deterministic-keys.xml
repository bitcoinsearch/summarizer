    <summary>Pieter Wuille proposed a Proof of Work (PoW) concept in 2012, which was not pushed as a standard. Slush found the concept to be smart but pointed out its lack of bidirectionality and ability to convert between mnemonic and seed. Jorge Timón raised concerns about removing offensive words from the mnemonics, arguing that these words have a greater emotional impact and are more memorable. However, Slush suggested adding a swearword dictionary to bip39, but it may not gain popularity.The author questions the effectiveness of removing offensive words from mnemonics, proposing that generally offensive words, especially when combined with each other, could optimize the &quot;maximum unforgettableness&quot; criterion. This proposal goes against the trend of removing offensive words and may not be well-received by users.Changes have been made to the BIP39 wordlist, including removing offensive words, resolving duplicities, and implementing an algorithm for detecting similar characters. Slush expressed satisfaction with the new list and requested constructive feedback for the final round. The implementation also includes password protection and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher. The goal is to finalize the project for use in Trezor and by other developers who want to implement the algorithm into clients compatible with Trezor.Pieter proposed a superior system to BIP39, which has built-in configurable difficulty and checksums. The system allows for the use of any dictionary/language/text generator, as the software on the other side doesn't need to use the same dictionary. However, it cannot encode arbitrary data. Slush made changes to the BIP39 wordlist, removing offensive words and implementing an algorithm for detecting similar characters. Password protection of seed and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher were also added.The Bitcoin community has reflected on the BIP39 wordlist and made changes to improve it. Offensive words have been removed, and an algorithm has been implemented to detect words with similar characters. Duplicities have been resolved, making the wordlist more satisfactory. Password protection of seed and seed hardening using Rijndael cipher have also been added. The algorithm will be used in Trezor, and other wallet developers want to implement it into clients compatible with Trezor.The email thread discusses the wordlist used in python-mnemonic. Offensive words have been removed, but concerns have been raised about potentially offensive or threatening word combinations. Changes have been made to replace offensive words, and suggestions have been made to rate words for potential offensiveness and use neutral nouns. The email ends with an advertisement for ServiceNow and a link to join the Bitcoin-development mailing list.In an email exchange, Matthew Mitchell expressed concern about potentially offensive words in the wordlist. Pavol Rusnak revisited the wordlist and replaced approximately 67 offensive words. The changes aimed to improve the overall tone and sensitivity of the list towards different audiences.Andreas Petersson suggested using NLP to generate a grammatically correct sentence out of 128 random bits that humans could remember. He also mentioned encoding information in word selection and syntax tree choice. However, this idea required a larger wordlist and had complexity limitations due to running on embedded devices.The developers of a cryptocurrency wallet are open to changes in their wordlist and will accept pull requests replacing potentially offensive words with more neutral ones. Concerns were raised about rude or offensive word combinations, and suggestions were made to use mechanical turk time to rate words for offensiveness and use neutral nouns instead of place names with political complications.In an email conversation, Mark Friedenbach commented on how image display problems persisted on Wikipedia due to add-ons blocking certain URLs. This highlights the importance of avoiding potential filtering issues when designing systems. The conversation also touched on the challenges of troubleshooting situations where rude word combinations may cause confusion.The author expresses a desire to combine an NLP engine with a mnemonic code generator to output a short, humorous story as a passphrase. This idea was explored further, and another individual expressed interest in encoding the key within the story itself. The goal is to make passphrases more memorable while maintaining security.In an email exchange, Matthew Mitchell expressed concern about potentially offensive words in a project. Pavol Rusnak encouraged Mitchell to come up with wordlist enhancements, acknowledging that the wordlist is not perfect. Rusnak emphasized the importance of providing good alternatives for every word removed from the list.Slush sent an email announcing the finalization of the draft and reference implementation of BIP39. The proposal aims to standardize the algorithm across various clients and fix design problems of the existing Electrum mnemonic algorithm. BIP39 is seen as a complement to BIP32, allowing users to easily backup and share their wallet across multiple clients. The email also includes an advertisement for ServiceNow and information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.In a discussion about wordlists used in BIPs, concerns were raised about potentially offensive or threatening word combinations.
