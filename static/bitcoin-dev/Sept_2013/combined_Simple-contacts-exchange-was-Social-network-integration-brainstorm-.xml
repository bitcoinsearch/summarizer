    <summary>Wendell is exploring ways to automatically exchange contact details between Bitcoin wallets in order to promote the use of identifiable names and photos instead of long, hard-to-verify addresses. One suggestion involves inserting a data lookup hash into the transaction, allowing the recipient to see the sender's name and photo. However, concerns were raised about storing this data on dedicated servers that could be coerced into giving up information or altering the system. To address these concerns, different solutions were proposed, including encrypting the data and using the transaction hash itself for the lookup. The goal is to find a decentralized way to store the data without relying on dedicated servers.In addition to the discussion on exchanging contact details, there was also a conversation about the payment protocol and the need for signed certificates. It was explained that the payment protocol is designed to simplify transactions and identity verification between parties. The sender submits a payment containing their own identity details, while the recipient vends a PaymentRequest containing theirs. This allows wallets to understand how to complete the transaction. There was also mention of the option to extend the payment protocol to support other forms of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).Overall, Wendell and the community are seeking feedback on the payment protocol and exploring various options to improve usability and security. They aim to find decentralized solutions to exchange contact details and ensure cryptographic proof of identity, while also considering the implications and challenges associated with implementing such features.</summary>
