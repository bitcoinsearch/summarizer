Benjamin also wonders if Blockstream now has commercial products and raises concerns about the launch partners mentioned in the announcement.Daniel responds by clarifying that Benjamin's questions are misplaced as he is conflating Bitcoin with Blockstream/Liquid. He explains that Blockstream does have commercial products and that implementing sidechains for exchanges was always part of their plan.Adam suggests that Benjamin read a Reddit thread on Liquid to find answers to his questions. He also notes that the email thread is off-topic for bitcoin-dev as it pertains to Bitcoin development.Overall, the email thread discusses Blockstream's implementation of sidechains for exchanges, highlighting questions and confusion regarding Bitcoin's relevance to financial institutions, market liquidity, capital requirements, and Blockstream's commercial products and launch partners.</summary>
