    <summary>Gavin Andresen expresses frustration with the moderation policy on an unknown platform, describing it as a disaster. He mentions that several messages, including his own and those from Sergio Damian Lerner, have already been rejected. These rejected messages cover topics such as a bug, CLTV, censorship of technical discussion, and complaints about censorship. Gavin concludes his post with a bewildered &quot;WTF?&quot; remark.On October 22, 2015, Rusty Russell announces on bitcoin-dev that all rejected posts will be forwarded to a public viewing list. However, these forwarded messages are not readable and only contain a message stating that an embedded message was scrubbed, along with a non-text attachment named signature.asc.A user on the Bitcoin subreddit asks if block size discussions are acceptable under the rule that posts must concern the near-term development of the Bitcoin core code or Bitcoin protocol.The Bitcoin Development Mailing List has implemented new moderator rules to increase productivity and improve interactions among developers. The moderation period will last for three months, after which there will be an on-list discussion to determine whether it should continue or change. Appeals regarding moderation decisions should be directed to Jeff, the final decision-maker. All rejected posts will be forwarded to a public viewing list.Currently, there are five moderators: BtcDrak, G1lius, Kanzure, Johnathan, and the author of the post. They represent Asia, Europe, and the US and have no connection to each other. The moderation rules include no offensive posts or personal attacks, and posts must pertain to the near-term development of the Bitcoin core code or Bitcoin protocol. Additionally, posts must contribute to Bitcoin development. Encouraged topics include patches, pull request notifications, BIP proposals, academic paper announcements, and consequential discussions. Conversely, discouraged topics include shower thoughts, wild speculation, jokes, non-technical Bitcoin issues, rehashing settled topics without new data, and moderation concerns. Detailed patch discussions are recommended on GitHub PR, while meta-discussions are better suited for bitcoin-discuss.All subscribers start off as moderated, with the mod bit cleared when they post. However, it can be set again if a violation is noticed or reported. The moderators recognize that mistakes may occur and ask subscribers for patience.</summary>
