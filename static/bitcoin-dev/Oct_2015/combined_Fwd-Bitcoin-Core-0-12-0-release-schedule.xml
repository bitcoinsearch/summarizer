    <summary>On October 1, 2015, Marcel Jamin questioned the readiness of bitcoin for production use. He listed his expectations for the upcoming 1.0 release, including practical API implementation, a user-friendly GUI, and a safe wallet. Luke also contributed to the discussion. In a conversation between Wladimir J. van der Laan and Marcel Jamin, the topic of Bitcoin protocol's version numbering was discussed. Jamin suggested that the $3.5 billion market cap and companies building on top of Bitcoin indicate that the 1.0.0 tag is overdue. Van der Laan explained that most investment in Bitcoin is not in the Bitcoin Core software and version numbers are not used as a signaling mechanism. The block/transaction versions are at v3/v1 respectively, and the highest network protocol version is 70011. This is due to considerations of software maturity and potential arguments.Marcel Jamin asked why Bitcoin Core software remains at version 0.11.1. Wladimir responded that most investment is not in the Core software but in things built on top of it. The assumption is that the network/protocol will not go down, relying on trust in the node software for consensus. However, this does not mean all implementation issues have been resolved. Version numbers are not used as a signaling mechanism, and questions about software maturity could lead to unproductive arguments.Wladimir explains in a separate discussion that software versions are incrementally numbered every half year without using them as a signaling mechanism. Using versioning as a signaling mechanism would invite questions about software maturity and potentially pointless arguments. Despite claims that Bitcoin is not following semantic versioning, the investments being made and the $3.5 billion market cap suggest that the 1.0.0 tag is overdue. However, this is not an important topic at present due to stress levels.Marcel Jamin's question on Bitcoin's relevance was raised on October 1st, 2015. Despite the challenges of fluctuating value and competition from other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains relevant due to its decentralized nature and versatility. Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network, making it resistant to manipulation or censorship. It can be used for various transactions and exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or traditional currencies. While facing competition, Bitcoin's established reputation and large user base give it an advantage.Marcel Jamin also questioned why Bitcoin versioning does not follow the SemVer spec. Btc Drak explained that they do follow the spec using a.b.c for major versions, with 0.12.0 as the next major version. Maintenance releases are labeled as 0.12.1 and so on, while release candidates are labeled as 0.12.0-rc1. Further information from an attached HTML file was not available.</summary>
