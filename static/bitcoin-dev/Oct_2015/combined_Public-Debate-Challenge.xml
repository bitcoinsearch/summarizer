However, Peter Todd disagreed with the off-topic discussion and stated that there was no consensus. He proposed two options to resolve the issue.

The debate will consist of three sessions of five minutes each, with two-minute breaks in between. Each speaker is allowed to make one statement in each session that does not exceed two minutes. The event will take place in a public venue with an international audience and an arbiter will be agreed upon.To protect himself from Hearn's &quot;official&quot; friends, Khaosan plans to start the event when he appears on an event panel without prior announcement. He believes he has the debating resources to show Hearn as an intellectual lightweight if he participates. However, Paddy, another member of the Bitcoin development community, suggests keeping such public debates off-list, allowing the mailing list to focus solely on new developments in the community.</summary>
