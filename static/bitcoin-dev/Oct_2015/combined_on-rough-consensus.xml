    <summary>Bitcoin participants can enhance their ability to remain on a valuable and censorship-resistant blockchain by embracing the concept of "rough consensus." This idea is rooted in the principles of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which emphasizes the rejection of hierarchical authority and decision-making through voting. Instead, rough consensus encourages open debate and the incorporation of feedback until objections are satisfactorily addressed.To achieve rough consensus within the IETF, objections are thoroughly debated, and strong objections are considered by the working group chair. The chair's role is to steer discussions towards productive interaction and determine when rough consensus has been reached. It is important to note that consensus does not require unanimous agreement or complete satisfaction with a chosen solution. Instead, it signifies that everyone is sufficiently content with the solution, having no specific objections against it.When someone objects to a proposal, it is crucial to inquire about the reasons behind their objection. Consensus is achieved when these objections are either addressed through appropriate changes or deemed insignificant. If this process fails, rough consensus can still be attained by ensuring that all issues are acknowledged, even if they are not fully accommodated. The working group chair must carefully evaluate the technical implications of not accommodating an objection and provide a reasoned explanation to the person raising the issue.Consensus-building without relying on voting prevents manipulation of the system and encourages the consideration of important minority views. The chair's focus should be on addressing outstanding technical objections rather than simply counting votes. Even if no one continues to advocate for a particular issue, it must not be disregarded. Rough consensus serves as a safeguard against making decisions with unforeseen long-term consequences.While Bitcoin Core is not an IETF working group, its developers can learn from the principles of rough consensus. By effectively communicating with the economic majority and ensuring clarity in their work, they can contribute to the functioning and improvement of the system. In conclusion, as Lao Tzu stated, defending with love provides security in the pursuit of rough consensus. For further insights into forming useful rough consensus, references such as "The Tao of the IETF" and RFC 7282 are recommended.</summary>
