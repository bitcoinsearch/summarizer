    <summary>In a Bitcoin development discussion, the origin of the term "simplified payment verification" (SPV) was debated. Mike Hearn claimed to have coined the term in a forum post in 2011, but another member pointed out that anyone who used the term SPV was technically "coining" it. The discussion then shifted to the definition of an SPV client and whether header-only clients without fraud detection mechanisms are considered incomplete implementations according to Satoshi's original definition. It was suggested that eventually, SPV clients should be able to detect any rule violation on the blockchain, including block size.The terminology around SPV clients was also discussed, with Satoshi referring to them as "client only mode" and Jeff Garzik calling them "headers only client". Hearn introduced the term "SPV clients" in a post on bitcointalk.org, but at that time, nobody used the term "SPV wallet" to refer to apps like BreadWallet or libraries like bitcoinj.However, some members of the Bitcoin community have accused Hearn of making false statements and attempting to harm and divide the community through his actions, such as the contentious Bitcoin XT fork. There is a debate about whether Hearn should be expelled from the Bitcoin-devs mailing list, with suggestions for a cooling-off period before any further action is taken.On Reddit, there is a suggestion to implement a cooling-off period before taking any further action. Some members feel that Hearn has crossed the line multiple times, while others believe that no action should be taken as they do not agree with TaoEffect.com and there is no consensus.The writer of an email expresses concern about the noise level and drama within the community list and suggests temporary bans based on circumstances rather than focusing on specific personalities. They address a post made by Hearn regarding false and damaging statements about Bitcoin, questioning whether he has crossed a line that would result in expulsion from the community. They ask for thoughts from the community and provide links to evidence of Hearn's behavior and claims.Hearn has been accused of making false and damaging statements about Bitcoin, including claiming to have coined the term SPV. He has also attempted to gain control of Bitcoin through the Bitcoin XT fork. Some members believe that Hearn should be expelled from the community, but it is unclear if there is a consensus on this matter. Hearn's actions have caused division and harm within the Bitcoin community for several years.</summary>
