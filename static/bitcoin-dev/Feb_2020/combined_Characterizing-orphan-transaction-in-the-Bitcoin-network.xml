    <summary>The paper's findings highlight the importance of understanding and reducing the impact of orphan transactions on network throughput. It suggests that increasing the size of the orphan pool can reduce network overhead without adding much performance overhead. This is because orphan transactions tend to have fewer parents with lower fees and larger sizes compared to non-orphan transactions, resulting in a lower transaction fee per byte. The study also notes that the network overhead caused by orphan transactions can be significant, reaching up to 17% when using the default orphan memory pool size. However, this overhead can be made negligible by increasing the pool size to 1000 transactions, without requiring significant computational or memory resources. The email discussing this paper suggests that further discussion on the software-level aspects of Bitcoin Core should take place on Github rather than the current forum. Overall, the discussion sheds light on the characteristics of orphan transactions and emphasizes the need to minimize their impact on network throughput.</summary>
