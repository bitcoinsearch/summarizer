    <summary>Additionally, Suredbits and Crypto Garage have released working code for executing 2-outcome Discreet Log Contracts and provided documentation on how to use it. They have also shared a short blog post containing a video demo of an execution. The team encourages interested individuals to review and contribute to the work-in-progress specification.The team's secondary goal is to ensure that DLCs become widely accepted and standardized tools in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They want to establish DLCs as a commonly used technology by creating a set of agreed-upon standards for funding transactions and closing transactions. This will allow every future Bitcoin-related protocol to have access to a toolbox of standards, making software integration more streamlined and efficient.For those interested in learning more about DLCs, there are several resources available. These include a whitepaper, articles, and research papers that provide in-depth information on the topic. By making DLCs easily accessible through comprehensive resources, the team hopes to foster widespread understanding and adoption of this technology within the Bitcoin community.Overall, Suredbits and Crypto Garage are determined to develop a robust protocol specification for using DLCs in a safe, private, and interoperable manner. They aim to create a common standard for using Bitcoin oracles, while remaining compatible with existing Bitcoin-related protocols. Through their efforts, they hope to establish DLCs as widely accepted and standardized tools in the Bitcoin ecosystem, benefiting developers and users alike.</summary>
