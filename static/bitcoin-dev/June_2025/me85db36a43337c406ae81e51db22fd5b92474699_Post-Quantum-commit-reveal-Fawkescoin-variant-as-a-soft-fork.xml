    <summary>In the recent discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, an important clarification was made regarding the procedure for performing commitments in transactions. It was highlighted that when making a commitment, it is advisable to purchase new BTC to ensure that the public key remains undisclosed during this phase. This strategy is crucial as exposing the public key could potentially compromise the purpose of the commitment. The necessity of keeping the public key private aligns with the guidance provided by Tadge, emphasizing that payments associated with these commitments should be conducted out of band. This approach ensures that the integrity and security of the transaction process are maintained, adhering to the foundational principles of cryptocurrency transactions.</summary>
