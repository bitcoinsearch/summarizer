    <summary>The proposal introduced by Leo Wandersleb offers a proactive solution to the potential threat quantum computers pose to cryptocurrency ownership and transaction security. Unlike existing discussions that center around reactive measures to be implemented after the advent of quantum computing technology, this scheme allows users to prepare for a future where quantum computers could compromise their digital assets without exposing their public keys or which Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) they control.

The core of Wandersleb's proposition is a commit/reveal mechanism that enables users to securely commit to moving their funds to quantum-safe addresses ahead of time. This is achieved by creating and signing transactions for future fund transfers to these secure addresses, then computing a Merkle tree of all these transactions and publishing only the root hash in a transaction (specifically, an OP_RETURN transaction). This process does not require any changes to the current consensus rules and can be initiated immediately by users who wish to protect their assets from potential quantum computer attacks.

Wandersleb contrasts his proposal with Tadge's earlier suggestion, highlighting key differences such as the timing (pre-quantum vs. post-quantum activation) and scope (migration to quantum-safe addresses vs. general spending with hashed pubkeys). Both propositions utilize cryptographic commit/reveal schemes but target different phases in the transition towards quantum resistance. The proposed method serves as a preemptive measure, allowing users to safeguard their coins without disclosing which UTXOs belong to them. It ensures privacy, efficiency, and flexibility, providing protection regardless of whether a quantum computing threat materializes.

This approach, described as a "poison pill" for quantum attackers, suggests that while attackers might be able to steal coins, the original owners would retain the ability to reclaim their stolen assets through pre-committed transactions. Wandersleb invites feedback on this innovative strategy, aiming to foster discussion and development within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List community to enhance the cryptocurrency's resilience against future technological threats.</summary>
