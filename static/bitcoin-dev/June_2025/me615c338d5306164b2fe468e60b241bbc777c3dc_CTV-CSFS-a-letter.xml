    <summary>Michael Folkson has been a vocal supporter of CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) for over three years, a fact that is evident from his contributions to the VAULT Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), as detailed in its [introduction](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0345.mediawiki). His deep involvement with the proposal even led to him being named a co-author on a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1482), highlighting his commitment and active role in championing CTV. Despite his support for CTV, Folkson also expresses interest in CCV (Congestion Control Verification), albeit with reservations regarding its readiness. He believes that CCV requires further scrutiny and evaluation by the community before it can be fully embraced or implemented. This stance underscores a careful and deliberate approach to the adoption of new technologies within the Bitcoin development ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of thorough community vetting and consensus.</summary>
