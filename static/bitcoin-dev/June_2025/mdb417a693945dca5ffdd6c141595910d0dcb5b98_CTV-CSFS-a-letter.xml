    <title>CTV + CSFS: a letter</title>

    <summary>The letter published advocates for the activation of OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV, BIP-119) and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS, BIP-348), proposing these as critical next steps for Bitcoin. Highlighted is the functionality these opcodes could unlock, from scaling solutions and vaults to non-custodial mining and discreet log contracts, underscoring their potential to preserve Bitcoin's value as a scarce, censorship-resistant asset. Despite the presence of other promising consensus layer improvements, the letter argues for CTV and CSFS's unique combination of thorough review, simplicity, and demonstrated safety and demand.

CTV has been in discussion for over five years, consistently emerging as a preferred method for enforcing transaction sequences at the consensus level. Meanwhile, CSFS, having been part of Blockstreamâ€™s Elements for approximately eight years, is seen as computationally efficient and versatile, with applications including enhancements to the Lightning Network and various other use cases.

The authors respectfully request Bitcoin Core contributors to prioritize the review and integration of these opcodes within the next six months to allow for comprehensive review and activation planning. This plea emphasizes the role of Core contributors in the activation process, acknowledging their influence without suggesting they dictate consensus. The signatories, representing a broad spectrum of developers and stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem, underscore their belief in the significant benefits these changes would deliver to Bitcoin users, particularly in terms of security and scalability.
