    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion within the Bitcoin development community, concerns were raised regarding potential legal implications of code changes that could lead to the confiscation of funds. This apprehension stems from the fear that developers may be held personally liable for any financial losses incurred due to such changes, especially in scenarios where a previously unforeseen method, like the arrival of a "bonded courier" with a private key, could have prevented the loss under older security measures. The conversation highlights the delicate balance between advancing technology to safeguard against quantum computing threats and the ethical principles foundational to Bitcoin, such as censorship resistance.

The term "ethical impedance-mismatch," introduced in this context, captures the conflict between the desire to improve Bitcoin's functionality and the commitment to its core principle of resisting censorship. This dissonance is evident in technical challenges like inaccurate fee rates, which arise from efforts to filter transactions at the peer-to-peer level, contradicting Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization and freedom from external control. The debate underscores a broader issue within the community: the tension between evolving Bitcoin’s technical capabilities and preserving its ideological commitments.

Moreover, the notion of "quantum recovery" was discussed as a necessary function of Bitcoin, advocating for the system's ability to adapt and recover from quantum computing threats without compromising its fundamental values. The argument posits that the integrity and resilience of Bitcoin hinge on its capacity for self-recovery in ways that might be unexpected or unorthodox but are crucial for its survival. The discussion implicitly criticizes any form of asset confiscation as antithetical to Bitcoin's essence, suggesting that such actions could undermine the cryptocurrency's very foundation.

This discourse among Bitcoin developers, captured in threads like the one shared by Peter Todd ([view thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/bmV1QwYEN4k/m/kkHQZd_BAwAJ)), reflects the ongoing struggle to align Bitcoin's technological evolution with its philosophical underpinnings. It serves as a reminder of the intricate challenges faced by those stewarding the development of decentralized technologies, where every technical adjustment carries profound ethical implications and potential legal risks.</summary>
