    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discourse around the potential legal implications of code changes within Bitcoin, particularly those that might allow for the confiscation of funds, brings to light significant concerns among developers and experts in the field. The apprehension stems from the fear that developers could be held personally liable for any resultant losses, a scenario that becomes increasingly plausible with legal precedents against Bitcoin. This conversation was sparked by Jameson Lopp's comments on the risks associated with introducing such changes, further echoed by Peter Todd in a separate but related discussion, which can be found [here](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/bmV1QwYEN4k/m/kkHQZd_BAwAJ).

The term "ethical impedance-mismatch," as whimsically termed by contributors to the debate, illustrates the conflict between the moral or ethical intentions behind improving Bitcoinâ€™s functionality and the core principle of censorship resistance that defines its existence. The efforts to filter transactions at the peer-to-peer level, aimed at refining Bitcoin's usability, inadvertently counteract its foundational ethos, leading to technical discrepancies like inaccurate fee rates. Such endeavors expose the cryptocurrency to vulnerabilities where external forces, including political and legal entities, could exploit these weaknesses for their control.

This dialogue extends into the realm of quantum recovery, underscoring a unanimous stance against any form of fund confiscation within the Bitcoin network. The argument posits that Bitcoin's primary function is to facilitate recovery independent of external influence, maintaining its integrity even in scenarios where significant amounts of Bitcoin are spent unexpectedly. The overarching sentiment suggests that the survival of Bitcoin hinges on its ability to uphold its commitment to censorship resistance, irrespective of the challenges that may arise, including the theoretical eventuality of a system collapse due to inability to address quantum threats before critical deadlines.</summary>
