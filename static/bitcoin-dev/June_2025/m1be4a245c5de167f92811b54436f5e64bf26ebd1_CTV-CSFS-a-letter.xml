    <title>CTV + CSFS: a letter</title>

    <summary>In an ongoing discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Michael Folkson raises concerns and seeks clarification from James O'Beirne regarding the proposed activation of consensus rule changes in the Bitcoin network, specifically referring to CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) and CSFS (presumably another technical proposal). Michael expresses difficulty in tracking James's stance and accessibility due to being blocked on various platforms, emphasizing the need for a more open forum for debate and questioning without the risk of censorship.

James O'Beirne, who had previously advocated for BIP 345 (OP_VAULT), is noted to have shifted his focus towards CTV and CSFS for activation, as per discussions in May 2025. This pivot comes despite earlier statements suggesting that OP_VAULT had been effectively superseded by OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY (CCV), a proposal put forward by another developer, @salvatoshi. Michael questions the rationale behind not pursuing CCV's activation and instead prioritizing CTV and CSFS, highlighting confusion and seeking clarity on James's current position and the strategic direction for these proposals.

The letter underscores a broader dialogue about the process of introducing and ratifying consensus changes within the Bitcoin network, touching upon issues related to community engagement, decision-making transparency, and the necessity for consistent advocacy from influential figures like James to foster widespread acceptance and understanding of proposed technical upgrades. Michael's inquiry reflects a desire for greater consistency and openness in these debates to ensure the community can effectively evaluate and contribute to the evolution of Bitcoin's underlying protocols.</summary>
