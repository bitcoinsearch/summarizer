    <summary>The discussion around the potential CTV+CSFS soft fork within the Bitcoin community highlights both interest and contention among developers and protocol researchers. The primary appeal of this proposed change is its flagship use case, LN-Symmetry, which aims to enhance Bitcoin's scripting capabilities and facilitate more complex transactions such as those used in multiparty channels. However, several points of concern have been raised that challenge the readiness for a "final review and activation" of these opcodes. 

Firstly, there is a notable lack of consensus among Bitcoin protocol developers and researchers about the necessity and implementation of the proposed opcodes, highlighting disagreements on how the functionality should be achieved. This divergence in opinions underscores the need for further deliberation and agreement before advancing towards any concrete steps.

Moreover, the proposal's main use case, LN-Symmetry, has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. In contrast, other developments like `ANYPREVOUT` were introduced with a detailed proof of concept, including a full specification and an implementation within a major Lightning client, providing a solid basis for their practical application. This comparison raises questions about the sufficiency of theoretical proposals without substantial practical demonstrations to warrant changes to Bitcoinâ€™s consensus rules.

Additionally, there seems to be a misconception that Bitcoin Core contributors are not engaged with research into more expressive scripting capabilities. This is inaccurate, as many individuals contribute significantly to both Bitcoin Core development and protocol research, indicating a deep involvement in enhancing Bitcoin's functionality. The current stalling of the CTV+CSFS proposal appears to stem from controversy over its content and a lack of effort from its champions to achieve consensus, rather than apathy from the community.

The urgency implied by a six-month deadline to implement these changes is criticized as reckless, given the existing disagreements and the absence of a demonstrated use case. Moving forward, the emphasis is placed on building consensus through strong technical arguments rather than rushing into premature changes to Bitcoin's consensus rules. Progress in expanding Bitcoin's scripting capabilities should be achieved cautiously and collaboratively, ensuring that all proposed changes are thoroughly vetted and agreed upon by the community.</summary>
