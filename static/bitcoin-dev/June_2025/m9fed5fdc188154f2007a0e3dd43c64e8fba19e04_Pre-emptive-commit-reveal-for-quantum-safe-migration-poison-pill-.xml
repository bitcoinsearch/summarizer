    <summary>In the discussion regarding the implementation of a soft fork within the Bitcoin network, it is crucial to ensure that double-spending does not occur as perceived by legacy nodes. This can be effectively managed by making announcements that are not considered transactions in the traditional sense but rather as announcements or using the OP_RETURN operation, from the perspective of these legacy nodes. Following a period of 144 blocks, it becomes necessary for the initially announced legacy transaction to be broadcasted. However, at this stage, nodes are expected to enforce compliance with the initial announcement, thus preventing any perception of double-spending by legacy nodes. This approach outlines a method by which updates can be implemented in a manner that maintains compatibility and integrity within the network, ensuring that older versions of the software do not misinterpret actions taken under newer protocols.</summary>
