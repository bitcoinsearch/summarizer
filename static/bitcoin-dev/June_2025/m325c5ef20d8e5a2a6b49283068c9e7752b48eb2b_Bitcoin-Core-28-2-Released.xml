    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin Core, 28.2, is now available for download from the official [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.2/). This release introduces new features alongside various bug fixes and performance enhancements. It also includes updated translations, aiming to make Bitcoin Core more accessible to a global audience. Users are encouraged to report any bugs encountered using the GitHub issue tracker, accessible via the provided [link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues).

For those looking to upgrade from an older version of Bitcoin Core, it's recommended to first shut down the existing version completely before initiating the update process. The instructions vary slightly depending on the operating system: Windows users should run the installer, macOS users need to copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt`, and Linux users should replace `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt`. Upgrading from a version that has reached its end-of-life (EOL) status is supported but may require additional time if a data directory migration is necessary. Furthermore, Bitcoin Core maintains compatibility with old wallet versions.

Bitcoin Core 28.2 supports a range of operating systems, having been extensively tested on Linux Kernel 3.17 and newer, macOS 11.0 and newer, and Windows 7 and newer. While it might operate on other UNIX-like systems, such environments are not frequently tested and using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is generally not recommended.

This release encompasses several notable changes across different aspects of the software, including build process improvements like the notarization of the MacOS app bundle and codesigning of all MacOS and Windows binaries. Other significant updates include adjustments to ensure compatibility with various dependencies and systems, such as the fix for compiling the libevent package on NetBSD and a cmake compatibility error fix for freetype. Additionally, there have been updates to testing processes and documentation, including the removal of a note about macOS self-signing and upgrading the license validity through 2025.

Contributions from numerous individuals played a crucial role in bringing this release to fruition. Acknowledgments were given to contributors such as 0xB10C, achow101, Brandon Odiwuor, fanquake, Hennadii Stepanov, josibake, kehiy, MarcoFalke, and Sjors Provoost, among others, highlighting the collaborative effort involved in the development and maintenance of Bitcoin Core.</summary>
