    <summary>The discussion revolves around the security and trustworthiness of presigned transaction vaults, highlighting that for these to be considered reliable, the use of ephemeral keys on a hardened offline device is crucial. This approach minimizes the likelihood of compromise, as it ensures that key generation and signing occur in a secure environment. However, there's an acknowledgment of a gap in the current technological offerings from hardware manufacturers, who do not seem to provide the necessary functionality for generating and using ephemeral keys in this manner. The conversation also touches upon a potential misunderstanding or miscommunication regarding the nature of presigned transactions being discussed, specifically pointing out a distinction between scenarios where the original signing keys still exist versus those that might require different considerations.</summary>
