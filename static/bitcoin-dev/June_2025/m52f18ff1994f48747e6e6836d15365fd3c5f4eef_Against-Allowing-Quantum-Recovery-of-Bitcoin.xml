    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The email discusses the nuances of responsibility and legal implications surrounding protocol changes within the Bitcoin network. It articulates a perspective on the potential for developers to face lawsuits for enforcing detrimental changes. However, it clarifies that developers do not directly enforce these changes; rather, miners and node operators are responsible for their implementation. This distinction is crucial in understanding who holds actual control over modifications to the network. The email further argues that the possibility of being sued for running specific software is weak, especially in jurisdictions like the United States where freedom of speech provides a layer of protection.

Furthermore, the message delves into the concept of trust within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While Bitcoin operates on a trustless basis by allowing participants to independently verify the state of the network through full nodes, there remains an implicit trust in the network's majority not to enact adverse changes. This brings about the notion that a collective decision by a supermajority of network participants to implement changes, especially in defense against threats such as quantum computing capabilities, should presumably override concerns about potential legal challenges.

The email also touches upon the individual's ability to resist unwanted changes by running software that rejects these modifications, highlighting the decentralized and voluntary nature of participation in the Bitcoin network. This underscores the balance between collective decision-making and individual sovereignty within the ecosystem.</summary>
