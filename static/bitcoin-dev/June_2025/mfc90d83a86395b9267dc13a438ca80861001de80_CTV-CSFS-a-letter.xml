    <summary>In a recent correspondence among Bitcoin Core contributors, concerns were raised regarding the project's direction, particularly highlighting a perceived stagnation in script functionality improvements and the integration of softforks. Mike Schmidt's publication of the 2024 year-end Core contributors survey revealed a lack of focus on these areas, corroborating personal experiences within the project. Despite discussions and proposals surrounding script enhancements and softforks, tangible code contributions toward these ends have been minimal, with instagibbs being an exception through his significant contributions to VAULT, APO, and CSFS projects.

The dialogue further reveals a historical reluctance within the Core community to embrace changes or proposals aimed at enhancing script functionalities. An anecdote shared about a private Core signal group conversation illustrates this hesitancy, where a joke was made about dismissing a pull request for CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY as spam. This attitude, coupled with the active engagement of a few members in covenants discussions, paints a picture of a project community that is somewhat resistant to change, at least in specific technical areas.

Moreover, despite longstanding stability in certain changes and considerable community support, there has been little progress in merging even the preliminary stages of script functionality improvements. This stagnation contrasts sharply with the project's earlier discussions around graftroot and APO, shifting focus towards policy, mempool design, performance optimization, and build systems. These areas, while important, are seen as less impactful than consensus changes which could potentially offer more substantial benefits to the network.

The letter posits that publicly voicing a collective desire for a shift in focus might encourage the Core project to address these issues. It suggests that creating a technical Schelling point through a public letter can highlight widespread support for certain proposals within the technical bitcoin community. This approach aims to provide a platform for builders and stakeholders to express their views and rally around a working draft without the need for extensive individual contributions, which can be time-consuming and fraught with social challenges.

Ultimately, the communication serves multiple functions: it signals a unified stance on desired changes, pressures Core contributors by demonstrating serious ecosystem demand, and expresses dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs without resorting to drastic measures like releasing an activation client. The letter reflects a strategic attempt to foster progress while acknowledging the complexities and potential risks associated with direct action in the Bitcoin development landscape.</summary>
