    <summary>Recent discussions within the Bitcoin Core development community have highlighted a recurring issue: non-contributors, sometimes even non-developers, intruding into forums intended for collaboration on Bitcoin Core, leading to wasted time, controversy, and misinformation. The essence of open-source development is voluntary collaboration among developers who choose to work together on projects they are passionate about, without any obligations beyond those specified by the license. Many developers hold personal moral values that guide their collaboration choices, but it's important to acknowledge that these cannot be coercively applied.
The situation on GitHub, where Bitcoin Core development primarily takes place, has been problematic due to inadequate moderation controls suited only for a narrow concept of open-source development. This has led to a call for re-evaluating how collaboration occurs, suggesting the possibility of moving towards a privatized, members-only collaboration platform. Such a platform would offer privacy for issues and pull requests, restrict public hyperlinking, and allow for controlled access through registration or application, while still continuing development under the same open-source license.
This proposed shift comes in response to the limitations of current public forums and office-based development practices, which can exclude many from the development process. By creating a private space for developers, the proposal aims to reduce unwanted interference and brigading, making the development environment more conducive to productivity and focus. Despite the privatization, the ethos of open-source development—such as public code review and releases—would remain unchanged, ensuring continued openness and accessibility.
The proposed changes aim to balance the need for open-source collaboration with the challenges posed by non-technical interventions and the demands of maintaining a productive development environment. By introducing mechanisms such as registration delays, probationary periods, and possibly proof-of-work entry requirements, the goal is to create a space that minimizes disruption while fostering a healthy, productive developer community.</summary>
