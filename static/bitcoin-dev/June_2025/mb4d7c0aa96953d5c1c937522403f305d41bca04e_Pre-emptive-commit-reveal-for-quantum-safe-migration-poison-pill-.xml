    <summary>In the exchange between Boris Nagaev and Leo Wandersleb, a critical aspect of blockchain technology, specifically within the realm of Bitcoin transactions, is brought into focus. The dialogue centers around the handling of reveal transactions plus commitment proofs within the blockchain network. A pivotal question raised is whether these transactions, upon being disclosed by a user, are immediately included in a block or if they are held in a state of suspension (referred to as being "on ice") for a predetermined number of blocks (144, in this context) before being mined.

The implications of each scenario are explored in depth. If transactions are instantly mined upon revelation, it introduces the possibility of double-spending UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs), even after numerous confirmations have been made. This scenario poses a challenge to the foundational principles of Bitcoin, as it necessitates the creation of a novel transaction state that is both confirmed and pending. Such a state would be essential to reconcile the need for older announcements to confer an advantage without undermining the security and integrity of the blockchain.

Conversely, if the reveal transactions are not immediately mineable and are instead held until they are deemed consensus-valid based on their age (144 blocks old, as proposed), the process for nodes to verify such transactions is called into question. Specifically, the mechanism through which nodes can authenticate the validity of a transaction claiming to have been created 144 blocks in the past, despite not being included in any prior block, remains unclear.

The discussion encapsulates a nuanced technical challenge facing the Bitcoin development community, highlighting the delicate balance between innovation and adherence to the digital currency's core principles. It underscores the ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality and security of blockchain technology, while also preserving the foundational tenets that have guided its growth and adoption.</summary>
