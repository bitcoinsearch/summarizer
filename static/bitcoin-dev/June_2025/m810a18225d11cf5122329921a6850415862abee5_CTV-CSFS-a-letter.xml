    <summary>The discussion opens up with a practical approach towards evaluating new features for implementation, emphasizing the importance of not only having these features ready but also showcasing their utility through compelling demonstrations or MVPs (Minimum Viable Products). It suggests that the real value of feature sets becomes evident when they are accompanied by interesting demos that illustrate their practical application. This method helps differentiate between mere theoretical proposals and those that offer tangible benefits, ready for parallel development if they cater to different use cases.

A critical view is presented on the challenges faced during the advocacy for CTV (CheckTemplateVerify), highlighting two main issues. Firstly, the advocacy often came with a strong stance against "recursive covenants," pushing for design considerations that exclusively favored CTV over other solutions like PAIRCOMMIT or CAT. This perspective limited the exploration of alternative approaches. Secondly, there was significant resistance to the idea of developing demos for proposed features before their activation, which hindered the demonstration of their potential practical applications.

Recent developments, however, suggest a positive shift in this attitude, as evidenced by the latest PR to bip 119 and efforts to build prototypes using CTV, such as Ark. This more open and constructive approach may pave the way for broader acceptance and integration of new features by demonstrating their real-world applicability and benefits.

The message also outlines a vision for leveraging a combination of technologies - including TXHASH, CSFS, and CAT - to develop prototypes for various applications like penalty-free channels, channel factories, and more efficient interpreters among others. These prototypes aim to explore and demonstrate the practicality of new features in diverse contexts, enhancing the blockchain ecosystem's functionality and efficiency.

Furthermore, the author mentions a hypothetical scenario where a collective commitment from developers or funders to prototype and report on these new features could significantly inspire further innovation and adoption. This contrasts sharply with the current situation, which is perceived as counterproductive due to negative interactions on social media platforms.

In conclusion, while vaults are acknowledged as an interesting concept, the currently advocated collection of opcodes does not seem to enable the implementation of distinct and innovative vault behaviors, casting doubts on their practical utility without further development and clearer demonstrations of their capabilities.</summary>
