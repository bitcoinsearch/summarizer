    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Dave reaches out to Antoine Riard regarding Riard's earlier post about a specific aspect of Bitcoin transaction management. Dave expresses that upon reviewing the post, he found the content to be self-evident, leading him to inquire if there were additional insights or nuances he might have overlooked. Specifically, Dave notes two apparent points from Riard's post: first, the necessity for exogenous fee bumping to maintain a separate reserve of funds sufficient for the task, and second, the variability of the required reserve size in relation to both the transaction size and the current feerates.

Dave also references an earlier discussion that addresses the same issue, providing a link ([GitHub](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4908)) to a pull request on GitHub which predates Riard's report by over a year. This reference suggests that the problem Riard discussed was already recognized within the community well before his report was published. Through this, Dave implies that the vulnerability or issue Riard aimed to highlight might not be as groundbreaking as presumed, given the prior recognition and discussion among developers. Dave's message reflects a desire for clarification or further elaboration on Riard's part, to better understand if there are aspects of the vulnerability report that he has missed or if there exists broader implications than those initially identified.</summary>
