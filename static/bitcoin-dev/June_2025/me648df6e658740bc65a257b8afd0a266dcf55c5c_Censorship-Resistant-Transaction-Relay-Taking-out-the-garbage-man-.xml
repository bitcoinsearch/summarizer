    <summary>In a recent discussion, concerns were raised about the potential legal challenges faced by Bitcoin Core developers, particularly highlighting a lawsuit from Craig Wright over alleged stolen coins. This incident underscores the real possibility that courts could compel developers to implement measures such as freezing addresses, despite the community's likely resistance to such changes. The inefficacy of court orders in the decentralized nature of Bitcoin does not diminish their disruptive potential, emphasizing the importance of avoiding actions that could be perceived as attempts to prevent certain transactions. 

The debate extends into the realm of mining decentralization, critiqued through the lens of the DATUM protocol. Despite claims of promoting decentralized mining, the lack of transparency and openness in releasing the full DATUM source code has been pointed out. The protocol's current design, with OCEAN approving blocks, creates a vulnerability where, if courts were to mandate censorship of specific addresses, DATUM would be powerless to prevent it due to its centralized control mechanism. This situation leaves miners with no choice but to hope for an entire rewrite of the proprietary OCEAN code to enable truly decentralized, uncensored hash power contribution.

The call to action is clear: for genuine decentralization, the immediate open-sourcing of OCEAN is imperative. Such a move would not only bolster the resilience of Bitcoin against legal and regulatory pressures but also align with the foundational principles of transparency and open collaboration that underpin the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
