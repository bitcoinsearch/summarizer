    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a discussion unfolded regarding the perceived reluctance of Core contributors to engage with consensus changes, specifically mentioning proposals for CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) and CSFS. One participant, addressing Andrew Poelstra and others, questioned the effectiveness of public pressure via an open letter on this matter. The underlying assumption was that such a tactic aims to coerce the target into action; however, the sender expressed skepticism towards this approach, suggesting it might counterintuitively lead to increased frustration rather than constructive engagement.

The discussion further delved into exploring alternative reasons behind the lack of engagement from Bitcoin Core contributors. The sender of the email posited that if the cause was not a deficiency in external pressure, then understanding the actual deterrents could be key to fostering more productive discussions and actions regarding CTV and CSFS within the community. This inquiry reflects a broader concern about how consensus changes are approached and managed within the Bitcoin development ecosystem, hinting at a deeper need for clarity and mutual understanding among its members.</summary>
