    <summary>The discussion highlights the potential benefits and missed opportunities in the realm of Bitcoin development, specifically focusing on the concepts of spacechains and statechains. The sender, despite not having contributed to Bitcoin Core, shares insights into their work on proof of concepts for spacechains, which can be explored through the provided links: [simple-ctv-spacechain](https://github.com/fiatjaf/simple-ctv-spacechain) and [Soma](https://github.com/nbd-wtf-soma). These projects aimed to enable decentralized blockchain platforms for asset transfers, garnering interest from companies like ZEBEDEE and Tether. ZEBEDEE had intentions of sponsoring a decentralized blockchain, while Tether was interested in a platform dedicated to USDT transactions. However, these initiatives did not advance due to the perception that necessary soft-forks were years away from implementation.

The sender also reflects on the implications of not having spacechain-for-assets earlier, suggesting that it could have prevented the utxoset-spam resulting from the BRC-20 protocol. They argue that earlier deployment of such technology might have saved resources that went into developing alternative asset transfer protocols. Additionally, the discussion touches on the exploration of statechains, highlighting the Mercury wallet and its underlying technology as promising for Bitcoin value transfers. However, the fixed lifespan of these statechains, due to limitations like the absence of APO or CTV+CSFS, diminished their appeal.

The sender concludes by pondering the costs of inaction in the context of Bitcoin's development. They suggest that delaying technological advancements leads to lost opportunities and unseen risks, emphasizing that the future potential of such innovations remains unknown if efforts are postponed. This reflection serves as a call to consider what might be lost by not pursuing developments in Bitcoin technology and to contemplate the possibilities that could arise from embracing these changes now.</summary>
