    <summary>In a recent update, Matt Corallo addressed a previous misunderstanding regarding the usability of CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) for BitVM, indicating a correction to his earlier stance. He acknowledged that contrary to his initial belief, which was based on his interpretation of recent Delving posts, CTV is indeed suitable for BitVM applications. This clarification highlights an important development for BitVM's operational capabilities, particularly in how it can fulfill its requirements while the community continues to explore more generic and user-friendly solutions like TXHASH.

The acknowledgment from Corallo comes as a positive note for the Bitcoin development community, especially those closely following advancements related to BitVM. The discussion surrounding the integration of CTV into BitVM underscores ongoing efforts to enhance Bitcoin's utility and efficiency. For further details on how CTV and CSFS improve BitVM bridges, interested readers can refer to the comprehensive discussion available at [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-ctv-csfs-improves-bitvm-bridges/1591/23). This platform provides a space for in-depth exploration of technical improvements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including the debated topic of CTV's implementation.</summary>
