    <summary>Antoine Poinsot has contributed to the ongoing development of Bitcoin's Script language, focusing on enhancing its capabilities through more sophisticated introspection and arithmetic operations. A significant part of this work involves the introduction of 64-bit arithmetic and new opcodes, specifically OP_{IN,OUT}_AMOUNT, aimed at facilitating advanced transaction types. Poinsot has developed prototypes for two vault-related opcodes: OP_VAULT and OP_CHECKCONTRACTVERIFY. These innovations leverage the OP_{IN,OUT}_AMOUNT opcodes to create transactions that enforce specific conditions related to the amounts being transferred, offering a novel approach to securing Bitcoin transactions.

However, Poinsot acknowledges existing limitations in his proposals, notably the risk of "amount replay attacks." To counteract these vulnerabilities, he suggests utilizing Taproot annexes, a solution yet to be prototyped but promising in theory. This proposal indicates a progressive attitude towards addressing security concerns and enhancing transaction flexibility within the Bitcoin network.

Furthermore, Poinsot's work signifies a belief in the complementary nature of different opcode categories. He argues that amount lock opcodes do not necessarily conflict with hash-based covenant or introspection opcodes. Instead, exploring the potential and limitations of hash-based primitives could inform more effective design choices for future introspection opcodes. This perspective underscores a broader vision for Bitcoin's development, emphasizing innovation and the iterative improvement of its scripting capabilities. For more information on the specifics of Poinsot's proposals and the technical discussions surrounding them, interested readers can refer to the detailed discussion at [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/op-checkcontractverify-and-its-amount-semantic/1527/6?u=chris_stewart_5).</summary>
