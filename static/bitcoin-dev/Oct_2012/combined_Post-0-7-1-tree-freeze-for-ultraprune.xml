    <summary>In October 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed freezing the tree after the release of version 0.7.1 until ultraprune was either added or rejected. Wladimir agreed with this proposal and had already merged some small changes that were approved for post-0.7.1. However, Wladimir later realized that 0.7.1 was still in rc (release candidate) and not yet final. He had merged a few changes from different contributors, but he didn't believe any of these changes would cause issues in rc2. If there were any problems, a branch would be created for 0.7.x and master would become the 0.8.x branch.On October 10, 2012, Jeff Garzik proposed to freeze the tree after the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune was pulled in or rejected. Wladimir agreed and mentioned that he had already pulled all the small changes that were acknowledged for post-0.7.1. Therefore, the freeze could begin.The proposal suggests freezing the tree after the 0.7.1 release until ultraprune is either pulled or rejected. Critical bug fixes and reasonable exceptions would still be allowed. It is not necessary for ultraprune to be perfect before being pulled, as further improvements can be made during the 0.8 development phase. The main challenge is getting everyone to acknowledge and agree on the design and direction of the ultraprune branch, particularly Gavin. High-level design approvals are more important than detailed code reviews, as any code mistakes can be fixed during the 0.8 development once the correct design is agreed upon. The actual code errors and potential issues will only be discovered through extensive testing. Jeff Garzik has already given his approval for the design.</summary>
