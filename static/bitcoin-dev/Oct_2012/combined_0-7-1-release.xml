    <summary>In an email conversation on October 3, 2012, Gavin Andresen suggested the addition of '-reindex' to perform in-place reindexing of blockchain data files, acknowledging that it needed testing. He also agreed to a proposal of not requesting blocks from peers with fewer blocks than them. Another suggestion was made to add the new RPC &quot;lockunspent&quot; to prevent spending selected outputs, which Jeff Garzik supported but raised concerns about its ability to miss raw transactions that spend outputs not in the wallet. However, Garzik deemed it acceptable since listunspent is already wallet-based and should be noted.During the same conversation, Gavin Andresen and Wladimir agreed to do a 0.7.1 release specifically to fix the bug where clicking on a bitcoin: URI led to no action on Windows. They also decided to add pull requests for in-place reindexing of blockchain data files and adding LOCK() for proxy-related data structures to prevent random crashes due to missing synchronization primitives. These pull requests were considered high priority and should be included in the upcoming 0.7.1 release, while others could wait. Links to the pull requests were provided in the email.Following these discussions, the Bitcoin community has agreed upon a 0.7.1 release to address the Windows bug related to clicking on a bitcoin: URI and experiencing no response. Additionally, a proposed solution to fix the problem of receiving a DB_RUNRECOVERY error on startup after upgrading from a binary running an incompatible version of BDB has been submitted as a pull request. This pull request addresses half of the issue along with fixing several other cases of broken wallets. Another proposed solution involves deleting the problematic blkindex.dat file and recreating it from the blk000?.dat files.Gavin Andresen, a prominent member of the Bitcoin community, inquires if there are any other high-priority pull requests that should be included in the upcoming 0.7.1 release. Finally, he suggests including other pull requests that have the potential to fix issues with the new raw transactions API.Overall, these discussions and proposals highlight the ongoing efforts within the Bitcoin community to address bugs and improve the functionality of the system through the upcoming 0.7.1 release.</summary>
