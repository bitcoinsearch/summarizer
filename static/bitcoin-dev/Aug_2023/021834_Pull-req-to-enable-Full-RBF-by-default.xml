    <summary>In response to a request for examples, the author challenges the credibility of the claim that merchants relying on unconfirmed transactions exist. They ask for concrete examples to support this assertion and express skepticism without evidence. The author has reached out via email awaiting a reply. They also query the specific services offered by Changelly that depend on unconfirmed transactions and inquire about the risk criteria set by GAP600. The author suggests that they and others on the mailing list can conduct test transactions if provided with the necessary information. However, they refuse to provide transaction hashes to protect the account owners from potential retaliation. The author questions the lack of specific examples of businesses that will be affected by the issue at hand and dismisses payment processors as irrelevant. They mention instances of mining pools being harassed over full-rbf and decline to share private contact information to prevent further harassment. The author suggests that if the service in question truly offered an unconfirmed transaction guarantee with tangible benefits, they would have ample data on pools practicing full-rbf. They question why this data is not already available. To view the original context, you can visit: https://petertodd.org 'peter'[:-1]@petertodd.org</summary>
