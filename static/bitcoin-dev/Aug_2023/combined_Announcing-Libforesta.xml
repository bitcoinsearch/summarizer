    <summary>Davidson Souza, the developer of Floresta, has introduced a project called libfloresta to the Bitcoin developers mailing list. Libfloresta is a fully-validating Bitcoin full node with an integrated watch-only wallet and Electrum Server. The main aim of the project is to create a compact and user-friendly full node for low-power devices like single-board computers (SBCs) and smartphones. Davidson is writing the main logic of libfloresta in Rust and generating bindings to the original code, allowing it to run virtually anywhere by compiling it to WebAssembly (WASM). The project is still in its early stages but has been successfully used on signet without any issues. Mainnet support is almost ready, but performance issues with bridge nodes need to be resolved first. The code is available on Davidson's GitHub repository, along with a blog post explaining how to use it in Rust. Davidson plans to write more documentation as the project matures and is deployed on other platforms. Feedback from the community is welcomed. In terms of consensus, libfloresta does not reimplement the Bitcoin Consensus machine from scratch. Instead, it uses libbitcoinconsensus and plans to incorporate the full libbitcoinkernel in the future. This approach minimizes the risk of misimplementations leading to splits. Davidson is also conducting cross-tests against Bitcoin Core to identify any inconsistencies before they become problematic. Davidson expresses gratitude to Vinteum for their support in his work with Utreexo and Floresta. Overall, libfloresta aims to provide a lightweight and user-friendly solution for running a Bitcoin full node, particularly on low-power devices. It offers compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure and can be used alongside Bitcoin Core.</summary>
