    <summary>The email suggests that the URI version of base64 is better. However, if the intention is to display these via QR codes, either option will double the density of the QR. This is because QR libraries treat them as binary data. In such cases, it is recommended to use UR encoding, which is used by over a dozen bitcoin wallets to encode PSBTs. URs are efficient with QR codes and have the additional advantage of being animated if the data carried becomes too large. The email provides several links for further information:- A top-level link about URs: [GitHub - Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/README.mduniform-resources-urs)- Information about the base64 encoding problem with QR codes: [GitHub - Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-003-uri-binary-compatibility.md)- The base UR tech spec: [GitHub - Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md)- A list of bitcoin wallets using UR for PSBTs: [GitHub - Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/gordian-developer-communityurs)- A list of UR libraries: [GitHub - Blockchain Commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commonsbc-ur)</summary>
