    <summary>The email discusses questions regarding the use of schnorr blind signatures in the statechain protocol. It asks why schnorr blind signatures are needed, whether they are used for on-chain transaction signatures or for credentials for transferring ownership, and if they are used for both. It raises concerns about the ability to enforce that the signature used was not generated maliciously and suggests that the trick mentioned may not be helpful in this case. The email also mentions the possibility of hidden forged signatures that can take the on-chain funds and questions how one can be sure this is not the case. It suggests the idea of enforcing sequential blind signing in the statechain protocol to avoid Wagner's attack.</summary>
