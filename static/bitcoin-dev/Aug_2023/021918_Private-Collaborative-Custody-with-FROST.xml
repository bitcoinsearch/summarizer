    <summary>Good morning Nick,I really appreciate the direction you're taking with this. I'm curious to learn more about the blinding process. Could you provide further details? From what I understand, it seems that the blinding occurs after the signing process. Is that correct? Or does it happen during the normal nonce commitment trading?One thing that caught my attention is the mention of Rijndael. It's worth noting that Rijndael is a symmetric key block cipher algorithm used in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Considering this, I wonder how Rijndael ties into the blinding process and if it plays a significant role.Overall, I'm intrigued by the concept you presented and I'm eager to delve deeper into the technical aspects. If you have any additional information or resources related to this topic, please feel free to share them.Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you.Best regards,[Your Name]</summary>
