    <summary>Some progress has been made in developing a reference library in Typescript for dCBOR and UR-based Envelope. However, there are plans to expand this offering to include reference libraries in other languages, potentially including WebAssembly (wasm) versions of the rust code. Although there have been reports of wallets using URs written in Javascript, no open source libraries have been announced yet.</summary>
