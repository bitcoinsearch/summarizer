    <summary>Ruben raises a point regarding Ryan's previous message where Ryan mentioned that invalid transactions or blocks are transmitted. Ruben argues that this transmission is essentially a non-optimized fraud proof and assumes the availability of this data, which is an unsafe assumption. If this step is not necessary, then users would not be validating and instead relying on a set of trusted entities. Ruben also disagrees with the idea that everyone can choose their own set of validators, as it goes against consensus. He emphasizes that if his set of validators differs from Ryan's, it could lead to rejecting a Bitcoin block with the peg-out, causing sidechain consensus failure to impact the mainchain.</summary>
