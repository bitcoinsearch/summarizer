    <summary>The email discusses the idea of reducing the blocksize limit in order to address concerns related to blockchain size increases and to promote the usage of the lightning network. The sender suggests that the blocksize limit may have been increased unnecessarily in the past, and now there is a need to reconsider this decision. They argue that by reducing the blocksize, more activity can be directed towards the lightning network, which is gaining popularity. The email implies that protecting against potential issues caused by blockchain size increases is the main reason for having a blocksize limit. The sender raises the possibility of people being more open to the idea of a smaller blocksize now that the lightning network is becoming more widely adopted.</summary>
