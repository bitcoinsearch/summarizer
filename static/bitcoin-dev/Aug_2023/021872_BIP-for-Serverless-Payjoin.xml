    <summary>The email raises concerns about securely sharing the secret key in the given context. It suggests considering Diffie-Hellman key exchange as other protocols do, to address this issue. The email also highlights a potential attack vector related to the architecture of relays having metadata. This could potentially allow them to time correlate messages with bitcoin network events and tie transactions to clients. The use of anonymized network connections like Tor is suggested to mitigate this vector, but it is unclear if it is necessary or palatable. The email expects this concern to be mentioned.</summary>
