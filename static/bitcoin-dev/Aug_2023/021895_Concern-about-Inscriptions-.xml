    <summary>In this email, the sender discusses the ongoing issue of Bitcoin script exploits and the vulnerabilities they pose to the system. They mention that these exploits are not new and have been a problem for over 14 years. The sender suggests that the loose flexibility of the Bitcoin system in processing predicatives is the root cause of these vulnerabilities.The email introduces two proposed strategies called Ordisrespector and Ordislow. These strategies aim to address the issue of aggression via the insertion of arbitrary data into the witness structure. Ordisrespector allows a regular Bitcoin node operator to opt-in or not to a self-defense mechanism for their storage property and integrity. This is done by signaling dissatisfaction with the current affairs of aggression through the insertion of arbitrary data into the witness structure. Transactions with inserted arbitrary data are not included in the mempool and are not relayed.On the other hand, Ordislow offers a similar self-defense mechanism by increasing the coercion cost of mining entities relative to the cooperation cost. This is achieved by not propagating a found block unless a configurable or maximum delay has elapsed, and the block contains at least one transaction with inserted arbitrary data in the witness structure.The sender emphasizes that these strategies are compatible with a permission-less system, allowing Bitcoin node operators to choose whether or not to participate. By implementing these strategies, it is hoped that the exposure for exploits can be minimized while maintaining the current status quo.Overall, the email highlights the ongoing Bitcoin script exploits and proposes two strategies, Ordisrespector and Ordislow, as potential solutions to address the vulnerabilities caused by aggression via the insertion of arbitrary data into the witness structure.</summary>
