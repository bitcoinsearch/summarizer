    <summary>Jonas, Nick, and Tim have been collaboratively working on a draft for a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) focused on Distributed Key Generation for FROST Threshold Signatures. They aim to present this draft to the broader community for review and discussion. The draft encompasses design considerations, comprehensive usage instructions, and includes a reference implementation articulated in Python, which they aspire to establish as the definitive specification for this proposal.

The documentation and the corresponding code are currently hosted on GitHub, accessible via the following [link](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg). The team actively seeks feedback from the community on their work. Despite the progress made, there are several aspects still under development. These include finalizing the wire format, generating test vectors, addressing potential extensions listed as TODOs in the draft like identifiable aborts, and formalizing the included secp256k1proto as an official Python package.

Additionally, it's noted that the deployment of FROST would necessitate a separate BIP specifically for FROST signing, which is acknowledged to be currently in development by other contributors. This initiative underlines the ongoing efforts towards enhancing cryptographic practices within the Bitcoin ecosystem, with Jonas, Nick, and Tim contributing significant advancements through their work on distributed key generation mechanisms.</summary>
