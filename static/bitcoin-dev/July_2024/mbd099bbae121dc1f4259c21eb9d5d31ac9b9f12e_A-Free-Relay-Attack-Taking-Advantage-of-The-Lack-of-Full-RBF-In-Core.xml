    <summary>Antoine Riard communicated with Peter on improving the process of handling vulnerability reports within the Bitcoin Core community. Antoine suggests that vulnerabilities should be reported anonymously, with the option to disclose the reporter's real identity at a later stage if necessary. To ensure the reports are taken seriously and reach the right people, he advises sending the emails directly to specific core members, namely achow101, sipa, or fanquake, while also keeping the security@bitcoincore.org email in Cc.

Furthermore, Antoine proposes the creation of a "hall of fame" webpage dedicated to acknowledging developers who report vulnerabilities. This page would not only list their names but also include other relevant details. Additionally, it could serve as a platform for the community to donate directly to these developers, thus encouraging more individuals to participate in identifying and reporting security issues.

Another piece of advice from Antoine is to adjust expectations regarding response times to vulnerability reports. He mentions that one should not expect responses over weekends and advises waiting for a period ranging from 7 to 30 days for a reaction before proceeding with a full disclosure, in case the initial report is ignored. This suggestion aims to set realistic expectations for reporters and ensure a structured approach to handling such sensitive information. Antoine also invites Peter and others on the mailing list to contribute more ideas for enhancing the vulnerability reporting process.</summary>
