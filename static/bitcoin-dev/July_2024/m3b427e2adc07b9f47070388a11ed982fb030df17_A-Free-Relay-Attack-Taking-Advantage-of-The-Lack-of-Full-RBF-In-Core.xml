    <summary>Antoine Riard clarified that he was not responsible for removing Peter from the mailing list, emphasizing his lack of access to manage such actions. The decision stemmed from a broader discussion among members of the security list associated with Bitcoin Core, focusing on the participation criteria for inclusion. It was concluded that active contribution, either through coding or code review, should be the benchmark for membership. Given Peter Todd's cessation of active contributions to the project, the group decided it was inappropriate for him to remain on the list. Riard also noted that this criterion was applied uniformly, leading to the removal of multiple individuals who similarly ceased to actively contribute to the project.</summary>
