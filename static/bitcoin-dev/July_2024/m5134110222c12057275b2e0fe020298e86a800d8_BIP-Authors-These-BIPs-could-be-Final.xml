    <title>BIP Authors: These BIPs could be Final</title>
    <updated>2024-07-12T12:06:17.032036+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/85f17817-e7cd-4896-85c6-ed0ed04f9219@murch.one/T/#u#m5134110222c12057275b2e0fe020298e86a800d8" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>The email highlights a review of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) currently classified as Draft or Proposed, identifying several that might be eligible for an update to Final status. These BIPs encompass a range of enhancements and features aimed at improving the Bitcoin network's functionality and user experience. Specifically, the proposals mentioned include BIP 38, which introduces passphrase-protected private keys by Mike Caldwell and Aaron Voisine, offering an additional layer of security for users. BIP 67, authored by Thomas Kerin, Jean-Pierre Rupp, and Ruben de Vries, proposes deterministic Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) multi-signature addresses through public key sorting, which could standardize the creation of multi-signature transactions. 

Furthermore, BIP 69 by Kristof Atlas suggests lexicographical indexing of transaction inputs and outputs to potentially enhance privacy and efficiency in transaction processing. Ava Chow’s BIP 86 focuses on key derivation for single-key Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) outputs, aiming to simplify and secure key management for users. The email also references advancements in network communication protocols and client-side filtering with BIPs 155, 157, and 158, spearheaded by Wladimir van der Laan and Olaoluwa Osuntokun, Alex Akselrod, among others. These proposals are intended to improve network efficiency and privacy through the introduction of the addrv2 message format and compact block filters for light clients. Lastly, BIP 159, proposed by Jonas Schnelli, discusses the NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED service bit, which is designed to enhance the functionality of light clients by providing access to blocks upon request while maintaining bandwidth efficiency.

The sender encourages authors of these BIPs to consider updating their status to reflect the current state of implementation or acceptance within the community. Additionally, the reminder extends to all BIP authors to review their proposals periodically, suggesting that this list is not exhaustive. This call to action underscores the ongoing efforts within the Bitcoin development community to refine, innovate, and implement changes that aim to improve the robustness, security, and usability of the network.</summary>
