    <summary>The lifecycle of Bitcoin Core releases, including the end-of-life (EOL) dates for each version, has been updated and can be accessed through their official site. This update is particularly beneficial for those planning to deploy Bitcoin Core or its components in secure hardware environments, where managing lifecycles can be more challenging. Additionally, appreciation was expressed for the collective efforts in establishing a more robust disclosure policy, acknowledging the work done by the involved parties. For detailed information on the lifecycle updates, you can visit [Bitcoin Core's lifecycle page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/lifecycle/).</summary>
