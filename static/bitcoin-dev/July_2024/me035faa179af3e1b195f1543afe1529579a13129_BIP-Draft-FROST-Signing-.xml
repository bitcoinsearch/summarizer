    <title>BIP Draft: "FROST Signing"</title>

    <summary>The proposed BIP draft focuses on the FROST threshold signing protocol, detailing its design, usage guidelines, security considerations, and includes a Python implementation alongside test vectors. For those interested in reviewing the draft and providing feedback, it is accessible via [this GitHub link](https://github.com/siv2r/bip-frost-signing). It's important to note that the draft does not cover key generation aspects for FROST. Instead, individuals are directed towards utilizing methods outlined in both the ChillDKG BIP, available at [BlockstreamResearch's GitHub](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/bip-frost-dkg), and RFC 9792 (Appendix C), which can be found at [the IETF's data tracker](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9591/). The call for community feedback aims to refine and enhance the draft further.</summary>
