    <summary>On October 13, 2014, Melvin Carvalho filed an issue related to adding secp256k1 into Web Crypto API. The addition of secp256k1 will be implemented natively in some web browsers. If there is any feedback from crypto implementers, they can add comments to the thread provided. Myron Davis reopened the issue and mentioned that secp256k1 is supported in several SSL/TLS libraries such as Botan, NSS, openssl, LibreSSL, PolarSSL, and JSSE. Davis also talked about how secp256k1 curve has some great advantages compared to the three other curves which do not define how they were generated. The curve has had lots of hardware and software supporting it. With the discovery of backdoors in NIST's random number generator, Davis would like to see a determined parameter curve instead of a &quot;random&quot; curve option. The email thread includes links to related bugs on Curve25519 and some MS Research curves that generated far more discussion.This is an issue filed for adding secp256k1 into Web Crypto API, which will be implemented natively in some web browsers. Myron Davis has requested to look at it again as secp256k1 is supported in several SSL/TLS libraries including Botan, NSS, openssl, LibreSSL, PolarSSL and JSSE. The other three curves have parameters that do not define how they were generated. On the other hand, the secp256k1 curve has advantages in faster signature verification and how the values were determined for the curve. With the discovery of backdoor's in NIST's random number generator, there is a need for a determined parameter curve instead of a &quot;random&quot; curve option.
