    <summary>In 2014, Mike Hearn, a former Bitcoin developer, addressed the issue of Linux distributions modifying Bitcoin Core's software while packaging it. He acknowledged that this was not unique to Bitcoin Core and that other projects had faced similar challenges. Hearn suggested that building good relationships with distro packagers could be the best solution. He also noted that Linux distros distributing apps licensed under GPL are required by law to offer the sources of the thing they build and distribute as binary. This allows users to check the difference with upstream.Hearn proposed trademarking the name of a project and enforcing 'clean' packaging as a possible solution to prevent Linux distros from altering software. He cited Firefox and Chrome as examples of projects that have successfully implemented this approach. However, he highlighted that this method would only be effective for binary distributions, not source-based distributions like Gentoo.Luke Dashjr, a contributor to Bitcoin Core, has made changes to the software to address user expectations. However, it is anticipated that similar issues may arise in the future with other Linux distributions. Trademarking the project name and ensuring &quot;clean&quot; packaging has proven successful with projects like Firefox and Chrome to ensure users know what they are getting. Renaming a project and creating a package under a new name could be a better solution for end-users and allow the fork to grow into something else, making it more usable for people on other distros. Although Bitcoin is already trademarked, Bitcoin Core is not, and the author intends to follow the same approach with another project called Lighthouse.Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist at BitPay, stated that there are no plans to add a blacklist to Bitcoin Core. This statement addresses concerns about a potential blacklist being added to the platform and dismisses it as a troll issue. Bitcoin Core is an open-source project serving as the reference implementation for the Bitcoin network. Garzik's statement reassures users about the platform's future direction, emphasizing the importance of remaining vigilant against trolls and misinformation campaigns surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.A developer named Luke-Jr expressed a desire to add code that could censor certain network traffic, such as SatoshiDice transactions, due to concerns about them being a denial of service. However, this could have legal implications. The ability to filter specific types of network traffic might make users legally liable for using it to filter illegal content, potentially endangering Bitcoin users. Law enforcement might attempt to enforce its use. To defend against law enforcement pressure, it is preferred not to include or even write and publish such filtering code. A developer from the Freenet Project requested someone to add this comment to the Gentoo bugtracker account.</summary>
