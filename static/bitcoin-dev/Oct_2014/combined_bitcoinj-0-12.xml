    <summary>The author of BitcoinJ has stated that stealth addresses and SPV do not mix well, and therefore there are no plans to support them. Instead, a description of how to achieve something similar with the payment protocol has been provided. The author's focus will be on fully launching Lighthouse and crowdfunding for decentralization/crypto-related projects, rather than working on major feature work on bitcoinj. If the author were to undertake a big project, it would involve refactoring the wallet so that it doesn't store transactions directly, only unspent outputs. This is because scalability limits have been identified as the top user-reported problem with the current design.On October 3, 2014, version 0.12 of bitcoinj was released by Mike Hearn. Bitcoinj is a widely used Bitcoin library that powers multiple wallets and other Bitcoin-related projects. This release includes notable enhancements such as hierarchical and deterministic (HD) wallets, support for multisig wallets, faster ECDSA, an integrated Tor mode, and various API improvements. The update also includes upgrades to the GUI wallet, which can be seen in a tutorial video. Additionally, bug fixes, cleanups, minor tweaks, and new APIs have been implemented. The documentation has been significantly expanded to cover encryption, watching wallets, HD wallets, and multisig/married wallets. A new document and accompanying screencast demonstrate how to extend the WalletTemplate app and create a native/bundled package that eliminates the need for Java installation. Some method names have been updated, and the package name has been changed to org.bitcoinj.Mike Hearn expressed his satisfaction and admiration for the capabilities of bitcoinj in the announcement of version 0.12. He mentioned that just reading the release notes gives one ideas for new applications. The updated library opens up numerous possibilities for developers to build applications using this technology. Wladimir congratulated Mike on the release, highlighting the library's popularity and its usage by various Android wallets, desktop wallets, and other projects.Version 0.12 of bitcoinj includes HD wallets with full support for BIP32 and BIP39 after 8 months of work. The release also incorporates various HD wallet structures, including BIP44. This update emphasizes the use of hierarchical and deterministic wallets, which adhere to the BIP32 specification. It introduces support for mnemonic codes (BIP 39) and integrates Tor using the Orchid library. Multisig wallets are now supported, and improvements have been made to the GUI wallet. The new HD wallets significantly enhance privacy by eliminating the reuse of change and receive addresses. Bitcoinj version 0.12 has been extensively utilized by multiple Android and desktop wallets, academic research projects, blockchain.info, Circle, Lighthouse, CryptoCorp, biteasy, BlueMatt's relay network, bitpos, and numerous altcoin wallets.</summary>
