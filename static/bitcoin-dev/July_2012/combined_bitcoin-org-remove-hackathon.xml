    <summary>The fear of advertisers' influence on the neutral content is why Wikipedia does not have advertisements. The corrupting influence is inevitable, which is why a good fun conference like the hackathon they just held should not have sponsors. In an email exchange on July 17th, 2012, Amir Taaki expressed his reluctance to sell speaker slots but acknowledged that it may become necessary in order to pay bills. He also stated that if such a situation were to arise, it would be made clear through scheduling and disclaimers that sponsored speakers were indeed sponsors.Taaki's email was in response to a discussion about the potential inclusion of sponsored speakers at events. While Taaki personally did not mind sponsored speakers, he believed that they should have somewhat relevant topics in order to prevent the event from becoming a &quot;circlejerk.&quot;As an example, Taaki expressed interest in hearing about payments innovation outside of bitcoin.In an email thread, Jeff Garzik raised a point about the appropriateness of having a hackathon on bitcoin.org and how it seems more community-focused. However, Luke-Jr argued that the site is more community-focused anyways since developers don't use it as much as other sites like GitHub. In the same email thread, Luke-Jr suggests that Bitcoin Consultancy/Amir's contributions to development for the conference should be sufficient to ask for-profit organizations like Bitcoin Magazine for some form of pitching in. It was also discussed that material for pull requests would be preferred over mailing list emails and git push when working on the Satoshi client since it is more efficient. Additionally, it was mentioned that they lost money on the previous year's conference and are hoping to break even this year. Any profit made will go towards next year's conference and paying for things to make a better conference. They want to keep sponsorship and community parts highly separated, and speakers won't be sold a slot unless they have to pay the bills.Amir Taaki requested to remove the hackathon from bitcoin.org and replace it with a conference instead. Vladimir raised a fair point that the hackathon is appropriate for bitcoin.org as it is focused on dev-related activities, but the conference might or might not be. However, Jeff Garzik said that the conference is community-focused, so he doesn't object to it being on bitcoin.org. He also suggested using pull requests which are preferred over mailing list email and git push when working on the satoshi client.In an email dated July 15th, 2012, Amir Taaki reached out to the Bitcoin-development mailing list asking if they could remove the hackathon from the bitcoin.org website and replace it with a conference. This email was part of a chain that included a previous inquiry by Vladimir Marchenko about promoting Bitcoin Magazine on the bitcoin.org homepage. It is unclear whether or not either request was granted.Bitcoin.org is a website that provides information on Bitcoin, including news, wallets, and exchanges. However, it appears that the website also promotes private enterprises, such as Bitcoin Magazine. It is unclear why some enterprises are promoted on the site and not others. The email from Taaki includes a link to a Live Security Virtual Conference, which covers topics related to security and threat landscapes in IT management. This suggests that Taaki may have been interested in promoting this conference on the bitcoin.org website in place of the hackathon event.The request is to remove the hackathon event from bitcoin.org and replace it with a conference. It is unclear what conference is being referred to. The website bitcoin.org serves as a source of information for users interested in Bitcoin and its related events. The hackathon event is typically an event where developers come together to work on projects related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The decision to remove the hackathon event and replace it with a conference would depend on the purpose and goals of the website. If the website is focused on providing information about Bitcoin development and innovation, then the hackathon event may be more appropriate. However, if the website is geared towards educating and informing users about the broader aspects of Bitcoin such as investment and adoption, then a conference may be more suitable.It is important to note that any changes made to the website should be done carefully and with consideration of the impact on the user experience. Additionally, it may be helpful to consult with other members of the Bitcoin community or experts in the field before making any significant changes to the website.</summary>
