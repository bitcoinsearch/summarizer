    <summary>The Bitcoin-development mailing list recently had a discussion about the issue of Bitcoin URIs starting with 'bitcoin://' and the need for adherence to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) compliance. It was noted that this URI format does not make much sense as there is no hierarchy in Bitcoin, and it goes against the flat nature of the system. The problem with accepting broken URLs is that people may never fix them, leading to fragmented de-facto standards.Andreas Schildbach shared his concern about Ben's use of QR codes that social networks cannot parse without '://' in them. He initially asked Ben to fix this issue, but when Ben stopped responding, Schildbach went ahead and added support for reading these types of URLs to bitcoinj. However, Schildbach worries that accepting broken URLs without any promise of fixing them at the source could lead to a fragmented de-facto standard.Gary Rowe suggested having more people email Ben to politely request compliance with BIP. Wladimir questioned whether Ben was the only one using broken URLs, as it seemed to be widespread already. The conversation emphasized the importance of maintaining BIP compliance and avoiding broken windows.The thread also included a link to an upcoming Live Security Virtual Conference discussing security and threat landscape changes, and how IT managers can respond. This highlights the ongoing efforts within the Bitcoin community to address issues related to interoperability and compliance.In summary, the discussion on the Bitcoin-development mailing list focused on the issue of broken Bitcoin URIs and the need for adherence to BIP compliance. Andreas Schildbach expressed concern about Ben's use of QR codes without '://' in them, and went ahead to add support for reading these types of URLs to bitcoinj. However, there are concerns about the potential fragmentation of standards if broken URLs are accepted without a commitment to fixing them. The importance of adhering to community standards and maintaining interoperability was emphasized throughout the conversation.</summary>
