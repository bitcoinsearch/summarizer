    <summary>During a discussion on June 7th, 2014, it was decided to remove the &quot;getwork&quot; method in the next release of Bitcoin. Jeff Garzik pointed out that most pool servers had already switched to using &quot;getblocktemplate&quot; and &quot;submitblock&quot; years ago, as these methods offer a more flexible and scalable approach to mining. Wladimir confirmed this, explaining that the new methods were superior and provided more information on how &quot;getblocktemplate&quot; works. The decision to remove &quot;getwork&quot; received no objections, leading to the merging of the code on Bitcoin's Github repository.Jeff Garzik announced the plan to remove &quot;getwork&quot; on June 7, 2014, noting that most pool servers had already adopted the use of &quot;getblocktemplate&quot; and &quot;submitblock&quot; long ago. These alternative methods offer greater flexibility and scalability for mining operations. Further details on &quot;getblocktemplate&quot; can be found on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Getblocktemplate. Wladimir did not provide any additional comments on the matter.The &quot;getwork&quot; method, which generates work for the Bitcoin network, has been largely unused on mainnet and other platforms for some time. This is due to its inability to meet the demands of the modern network. As a result, the upcoming release of Bitcoin plans to remove &quot;getwork&quot;. It is worth noting that most pool servers have already transitioned away from &quot;getwork&quot; years ago. Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open source evangelist at BitPay, Inc., shared this information.</summary>
