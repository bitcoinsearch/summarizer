    <summary>Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin Core developer and open source evangelist, has proposed implementing pull request #2340 from the Bitcoin GitHub repository. The pull request, titled "Discourage fee sniping with nLockTime," aims to discourage users from taking advantage of low fees by locking transactions for a specific period using nLockTime. Garzik is seeking feedback from other wallet implementors regarding this proposal. He is also affiliated with BitPay, Inc., a payment service provider that supports Bitcoin transactions. Aaron Voisine, the developer of breadwallet, an open-source SPV wallet, has expressed interest in implementing a new feature to discourage fee sniping using nLockTime. Garzik posted a message on the Bitcoin-development mailing list on June 6th, 2014, requesting comments about incorporating the feature into the codebase. Interested parties can find the proposed change on GitHub as pull request #2340 in the Bitcoin repository. In addition, Garzik mentions NeoTech's "Graph Databases" book, which is available for free download, at the end of his email.</summary>
