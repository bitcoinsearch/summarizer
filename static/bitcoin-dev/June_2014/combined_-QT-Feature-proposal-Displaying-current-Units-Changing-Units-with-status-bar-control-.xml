    <summary>Angel has shared an update regarding the addition of features to a project. The update includes showing the current unit on the header column title &quot;Amount ($unitHere)&quot; and adding a confirmation dialog to prevent users from changing the current unit of display by mistake. Gregory Maxwell suggests that if a global setting is added in the status bar, it should be done in a way where it's impossible for a stray keypress to switch it.In an email dated June 2, 2014, Wladimir expressed uncertainty about the potential benefits of a global setting in the status bar. He suggested that such a setting might make it more clear to users that multiple units can be selected. However, he also cautioned that any implementation should ensure that a stray keypress could not accidentally switch the setting, as this could result in serious consequences for the user.In a conversation between Angel Leon and Wladimir, they are discussing the addition of a global setting in the status bar for Bitcoin. Angel shares an attachment and asks for feedback on whether this would be valuable in terms of user experience. Wladimir responds that they already allow specifying a unit in all places where the user can specify a BTC amount, and show the unit in all places where amounts are shown except for tables. He suggests adding a [unit] in the table header and is unsure how much a global setting in the status bar would add. Additionally, he notes that it may make it more apparent to the user that multiple units can be selected. There is also a link to an issue on Github related to adding the [unit] in the table header.In this email exchange, Angel Leon proposes the idea of a status bar component that would show the current unit of display and allow users to easily change it. The context is around the default unit of display for Bitcoin transactions, with debate over whether it should be BTC or mBTC. The dropdown menu for changing the unit of display would be a common part of the layout, but a slight optimization suggested was to also include the unit in the transaction table header so that users don't have to think about the unit of their values. Leon includes an attachment of how the status bar component would look and asks for feedback before submitting a pull request.There has been a debate over the default unit of display to use for Bitcoin transactions. The conversation can be found on GitHub and was closed. Regular users may have trouble finding a way to change the current unit of display, so having a status bar component that shows the current unit of display and allows easy changing could be beneficial. The proposed component would show the current unit of display at all times and allow users to easily change it. Feedback is being requested before submitting a pull request to polish the component.</summary>
