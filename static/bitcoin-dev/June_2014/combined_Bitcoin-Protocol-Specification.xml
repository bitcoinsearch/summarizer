    <summary>On July 14, 2014, Mike Hearn raises the question of whether it is possible to create proper protocol specifications for Bitcoin other than the original C++ codebase. The response is affirmative, but with the caveat that previous attempts have failed due to the complexity of Bitcoin. Krzysztof Okupski and Jeff Garzik discuss renaming the document &quot;Bitcoin Developer Specification&quot; to &quot;Bitcoin Developer Reference&quot; and acknowledge its value as a description of the protocol for beginners. However, they also recognize that implementing the protocol based on the document would result in mistakes.Wladimir confirms that the resource in question has already been linked under &quot;Additional Resources&quot; on the developer guide. The conversation ends with a cautionary note to be careful with the usage of the word &quot;specification&quot;.Krzysztof Okupski announces that the Bitcoin specification will now be under version control on GitHub. This move aims to increase the number of Bitcoin developers by making the system more understandable. The old link to the PDF version will also be kept updated.Matt Whitlock inquires about a specification document for Satoshi's P2P protocol, specifically how blocks and transactions are communicated over the network. A high-level guide is provided via a link to the developer guide on bitcoin.org, but it is noted that this guide is not a protocol specification. However, the Bitcoin wiki page and a forum thread on bitcointalk.org are suggested as resources for understanding the P2P protocol.Aaron Voisine shares a short description in code comments for breadwallet, and Matt Whitlock asks if anyone is working on a specification document for Satoshi's P2P protocol. Interest in understanding how blocks and transactions are communicated over the network is expressed.Isidor Zeuner shares a link to a PDF document about Bitcoin's design, and JMOlmos GMail asks if there is a translation available. Isidor suggests putting the document source under version control to facilitate tracking future protocol improvements.Krzysztof Okupski receives commendation for his work on a Bitcoin reference document, and the idea of putting the document source under version control is suggested. A request for translation assistance is made, and the email thread is sent to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.Krzysztof Okupski has created a document on Bitcoin's design that is praised as a great reference. The suggestion of putting the document source under version control is made, and Krzysztof thanks Isidor in advance for any further improvement proposals.Krzysztof Okupski posts a revised version of the Bitcoin Protocol Specification that incorporates feedback from Bitcoin Core developers and enthusiasts. He hopes the revised version will be useful to the community and welcomes additional improvement proposals.In May 2014, Krzysztof Okupski requests feedback on a Bitcoin protocol specification he has written. The purpose of the email is to improve the quality of the document and ask for suggestions and error corrections. A link to the front page of the document and contact information are provided.Overall, the context discusses various discussions and exchanges related to creating proper protocol specifications for Bitcoin, particularly the Bitcoin Developer Reference. The challenges and limitations of creating such specifications are highlighted, along with the value of the existing resources available.</summary>
