    <summary>The writer suggests that both BIP70 and Bluetooth payment mechanisms can coexist. For BIP70, a fixed QR code can be printed on paper next to a cash register. The PoS system would upload payment details to the server, which would then serve it when the user scans the QR code. Alternatively, Andreas' work on Bluetooth can be used where the QR code contains the BT MAC of the device, and the payment request is downloaded that way. This approach is already implemented. The writer believes that if a seller can scan a user's phone, the user's phone can also scan a rectangle near the sales counter. The QR code can also be an NFC tag with a little icon in the middle to indicate touch functionality.The proposal suggests extending BIP 70 to allow wallets to be scanned by merchant barcode readers instead of the other way around. This would make it easier for mobile wallets to request a bill and greatly ease checkouts at drive-throughs. The proposed message BillRequest includes fields such as a Unix timestamp for when the request was created, an optional expiration date, and a URL where a BIP70 payment request can be sent. To avoid confusion with existing QR code usage, the author recommends displaying a non-QR barcode like a PDF417 barcode to initiate the Bill Request flow. While NFC technology could also be used, it may not be suitable for smaller wearables entering the market. The author suggests exploring different technologies before writing a specification.The proposed BIP 70 extension would allow wallets to be scanned by merchant barcode readers, initiating a payment request flow. This is necessary for mobile wallets to request a bill and start a payment protocol flow. Currently, wallets either scan a merchant barcode or click on a URL link to initiate BIP70 payment flows. However, successful non-bitcoin mobile wallet apps allow for the wallet app to be scanned by the merchant. To promote bitcoin adoption, a mechanism for wallets to be scanned by merchant barcode readers at brick and mortar shops is needed. The BillRequest message includes a Unix timestamp for creation and an optional expiration date. It also includes a bill_request_uri, which can be a URL where a BIP70 payment request can be sent, or other URI options like &quot;sms:860-555-1212&quot; or &quot;mailto:asdf at gmail.com.&quot; To avoid confusion with existing QR code usage, wallet apps are recommended to display a non-QR barcode like a PDF417 barcode to initiate the Bill Request flow. While NFC technology could potentially replace this extension, it is currently uncommon and may not be suitable for smaller wearables entering the market. The proposed BIP 70 extension would greatly improve checkouts at drive-throughs and allow merchants to utilize existing hardware.</summary>
