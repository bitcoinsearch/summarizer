    <summary>Geir Harald Hansen, representing Bitminter, is inquiring about the process to get Bitminter on the list of approved mining pools at bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining. The website provides a list of recommended mining pools for users to choose from when mining Bitcoin. To have Bitminter added to the list, there are likely certain requirements that must be met. It is unclear what these requirements are, but it is likely that the pool must meet certain criteria such as being secure and reliable.Bitminter is a popular Bitcoin mining pool that has been operating since 2011. It boasts a user-friendly interface and low fees for its members. However, being listed on the bitcoin.org website could potentially increase traffic and membership for the pool. It is important for mining pool operators like Bitminter to be vigilant about security and reliability. With so much money at stake, users need to trust that their funds are safe and that the pool will operate efficiently. Being listed on a reputable website like bitcoin.org could help build trust with potential members.In order to address Geir Harald Hansen's query, David A. Harding suggests adding known good/bad pools to the Comparison of mining pools page on the Bitcoin Wiki. This information is needed to make accurate guesses about how many additional confirmations are needed while the situation persists. He also mentions that he will update the Bitcoin.org alert to point to the Wiki page. Additionally, Jameson Lopp suggests opening an issue or submitting a pull request on GitHub to get Bitminter on the list of approved pools. The specific page on GitHub where this can be done is provided in the discussion thread.</summary>
