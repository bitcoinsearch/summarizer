    <summary>The ongoing development of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at enhancing the Bitcoin protocol's security against quantum computing threats is currently under discussion within the community. A draft of this proposal, accessible for review and collaboration, is hosted on GitHub at [this link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1670). This initiative has sparked conversations across various platforms, including the Bitcoin developers' mailing list, the Delving Bitcoin forum, the Bitcoin Optech newsletter, and its podcast. The discussions are centered around the adoption of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, specifically SPHINCS+ and Dilithium, to ensure the long-term security of Bitcoin against quantum computer attacks.

The proposed BIP outlines several key enhancements to the Bitcoin protocol. These include the integration of quantum-resistant signature algorithms, the introduction of new Bech32-based address formats for quantum-resistant addresses, and modifications to the transaction structures and script opcodes to accommodate larger signature sizes. Additionally, the proposal suggests a transition mechanism through a soft fork, which aims to maintain backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin addresses and transactions, thereby ensuring a seamless integration of these new security measures.

Agust√≠n Cruz, the proponent of this BIP, invites the Bitcoin development community to review the draft and provide feedback. By opening up the proposal for community input, Cruz seeks to refine the approach to implementing quantum-resistant cryptography within the Bitcoin protocol. The full text of the BIP draft is available for review at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md), where developers and interested parties are encouraged to share their insights and suggestions to improve the proposal further.</summary>
