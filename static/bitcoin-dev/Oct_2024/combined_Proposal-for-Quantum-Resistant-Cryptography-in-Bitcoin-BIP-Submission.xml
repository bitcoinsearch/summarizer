    <summary>The introduction of quantum-resistant cryptography to the Bitcoin protocol is central to a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). This proposal comes in response to the rapid developments in quantum computing, which pose a potential threat to Bitcoin's security framework. By integrating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, specifically SPHINCS+ and Dilithium, the proposal aims to fortify Bitcoin against such advancements, ensuring its security in the long term.

To effectively integrate these new cryptographic algorithms, the proposal outlines several significant modifications. These include the adoption of a new Bech32-based address format tailored for quantum-resistant addresses, along with changes to transaction structures and script opcodes to accommodate the larger signature sizes required by quantum-resistant algorithms. Additionally, it proposes a transition mechanism through a soft fork, aimed at preserving backward compatibility with existing Bitcoin addresses and transactions. This thoughtful approach highlights a commitment to maintaining the network's integrity while embracing necessary security enhancements.

Agust√≠n Cruz, the proposer of this significant BIP, has made the draft publicly available for community review and feedback at [https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md](https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxx.md). Emphasizing the value of community input, Cruz invites suggestions and discussions to refine and improve the proposal. This collaborative approach underscores the importance of collective effort in advancing the security and functionality of the Bitcoin protocol.</summary>
