    <summary>The proposal to prevent address reuse within certain protocols has been a topic of discussion on multiple occasions, but consistently faces rejection. A primary concern with enforcing such a measure is its potential interference with Layer 2 (L2) protocols that may have legitimate reasons for reusing addresses. Additionally, there exists the risk that adversaries could exploit this system to unintentionally force address reuse, leading to transactions being erroneously blocked or "pinned" by the proposed filter. These issues highlight significant drawbacks to implementing a restriction against address reuse, underscoring the complexity and potential unintended consequences of such a policy in the context of decentralized networks and digital currency protocols.
