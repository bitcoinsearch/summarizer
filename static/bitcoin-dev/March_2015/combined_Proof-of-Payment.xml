    <summary>In the context, a new idea called Proof of Payment (PoP) has been proposed by Kalle Rosenbaum to provide proof that a payment has been made. This concept can be applied in various scenarios such as pre-paid hotel rooms, online video rental services, ad-signs, and lotteries. PoP is unique because it can be generated on demand and is only usable once to prevent theft issues. It is also capable of creating PoP for any payment regardless of script type.The author discusses the current methods of proving payment, including BIP0070 and signing messages with private keys. However, the author believes that these methods have limitations. To address this, the author introduces the data structure and process for PoP. This involves generating a request from the server to the wallet, identifying the transaction, creating an unsigned PoP, signing the UPoP to create PoP, sending PoP to the destination, and validating it.The format of PoP and security issues are also addressed in the context. Potential interception of PoP requests and stealing of PoP are identified as potential concerns. The importance of maintaining the security of wallets after they have been emptied is emphasized. Further work to be done includes extending BIP0070 for PoPs, defining an extension for BIP0021 to support PoP requests, implementing a proof-of-concept, and proposing BIPs for the different parts.In addition, the context mentions the concept of Anonymous Credentials, which provides privacy for service usage while maintaining accountability for payment. The issuance of Anonymous Credentials is not atomic with payment transactions, but proof of payment can be used in court if the credentials are not issued. The Zerocoin developers have also published a paper on a blockchain version of Distributed Anonymous Credentials, with a link provided for additional information.Overall, the proposal of Proof of Payment (PoP) aims to offer a reliable method for proving that a payment has been made, with various use cases and desirable properties discussed. The context also highlights the need for further development and implementation of PoP-related protocols and extensions.</summary>
