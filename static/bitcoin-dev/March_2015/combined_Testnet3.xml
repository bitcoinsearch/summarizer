    <summary>The author of the post is facing issues while migrating their .NET node to testnet. They have confirmed that their messages are being sent with the correct packet magic using Wireshark. However, when they connect to a test node obtained from DNS seed testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org, they do not receive a verack or version in response. Instead, they only receive a ping before the connection is severed by the remote node. The author is perplexed as they are using the correct testnet3 packet magic value and their code is specifically looking for it. Interestingly, their code functions properly with the mainnet packet magic value. It is worth noting that the author's code was previously stuck in a loop/ping circuit, but it started working correctly without any changes made.Currently, the user is developing a .NET node for communication on the P2P network. They now want to migrate to the testnet to begin making and validating transactions. Their current packet magic value is 0x0b110907, and they have verified through Wireshark that their messages contain this packet magic. However, when they attempt to connect to a test node obtained from DNS seed testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org and send a version message with the testnet3 packet magic, they do not receive the expected verack or version in response. Instead, they only receive a ping before the connection is abruptly terminated by the remote node. In an effort to resolve this issue, the user has been debugging their code and ensuring that it is specifically looking for the testnet3 packet magic. However, despite their efforts, they still do not receive the desired response from the node. It is important to note that the code functions properly when using the mainnet packet magic value of 0x0f9beb4d9.</summary>
