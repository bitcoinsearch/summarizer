    <summary>The proposal, introduced by Алексей Мутовкин via bitcoin-dev, suggests splitting the Bitcoin blockchain database (BBD) annually to address the inconvenience of a 140gb full wallet. Under this proposed routine, the BBD will be divided into two parts: old blocks before the split date and new blocks starting from the first technical block with all rolled totals on the split date.To further enhance efficiency, tiny totals that are not profitable may be transferred to miners or deleted altogether, aiming to cut the long tail of tiny holders. Additionally, the old blocks will be consolidated into annual megablocks and stored in the side archive chain. This storage system will serve future purposes such as FBI investigations or other goals.This concept, historically referred to as &quot;flip the chain&quot; and/or &quot;UTXO commitments,&quot; is not entirely new but requires intricate design and implementation. The proposed approach offers an alternative to pruning, which involves deleting old transactions to reduce the blockchain size. While the prune option saves disk space, the initial synchronization still necessitates downloading the complete database. Therefore, the annual split provides a more convenient solution for users, allowing most nodes to hold only the rolled database while fewer archive nodes maintain a full expanded database. By implementing this routine, the goal is to improve the overall user experience and alleviate the burden of managing a large wallet.</summary>
