    <summary>The ongoing debate over the activation of the CTV soft fork on Bitcoin Core has sparked contention among developers. Michael Folkson, a developer on the platform, has expressed concern that if the activation attempt causes uncertainty and confusion, it will make future soft forks with community consensus much harder to implement. Folkson urges developers to assume good faith unless accusing someone of being an NSA-adjacent asset.Folkson explains that the latest Bitcoin Core release candidate does not contain any new soft fork code, including CTV code or activation code. Running Bitcoin Core 23.0 out of the box will not signal for any new soft fork or enforce any new rules. However, most individuals who oppose the CTV soft fork have not logged their opposition on Jeremy's site, leading to exclusion in discussions.According to Folkson, if 90% of miners do not signal for the CTV soft fork, the activation attempt will fail. If 90% do signal, the fork could activate unless full nodes resist it. Folkson advises those opposed to voice their opposition, run full node software without CTV code, and consider running software rejecting CTV rules post-activation. The focus should be on resisting soft forks without community consensus and preventing fragmentation of Bitcoin into different assets.The email exchange between members of the Bitcoin community discusses the role of miners in deciding the fate of soft forks. It emphasizes the need for consensus-based decision-making and challenges the notion that miners have authority over soft forks. It also highlights the differing perspectives on the activation of CTV and the importance of evaluating alternatives and taking time to analyze changes to Bitcoin.In another email exchange, Robin criticizes Michael's opposition to CTV activation and accuses him of stalling protocol development. Robin argues that focusing on protocol development instead of unnecessary debates is crucial. Michael denies being a full-time CTV developer or advocate, expressing skepticism about its suitability for intended use cases. The exchange highlights the different viewpoints within the Bitcoin community and the need for constructive discussions.The email exchange between two members of the Bitcoin community discusses the activation of CTV and its potential use cases. The sender emphasizes the importance of analyzing new changes and compares the maturity of CTV with Taproot. They suggest evaluating alternatives and choosing the best tool available. The recipient raises concerns about chain split risks and urges opposition to the activation attempt.In another exchange, Robin challenges Michael's proposal for alternative covenant enabling proposals and questions his contribution to progress. Robin highlights Jeremy's extensive work on covenant enabling proposals and suggests that Michael should focus on finding a better solution instead of criticizing. Michael responds by expressing skepticism about CTV's suitability and suggesting actions for those opposing the activation attempt.Michael Folkson responds to Robin Linus's email opposing CTV activation, expressing doubts about its suitability without consensus. He suggests building use cases and comparing alternatives before activation. Robin criticizes Michael's lack of tangible contributions and urges him to work towards a solution rather than criticizing. Jeremy Rubin advocates for CTV activation and outlines the reasons supporting it.The debate focuses on the risks and benefits of CTV activation, with concerns about chain splits and the need for consensus-based decision-making. The discussions highlight the importance of constructive dialogue, evaluation of alternatives, and community consensus in protocol development.In his latest update, Jeremy emphasizes the importance of resisting soft forks that lack community consensus in order to prevent Bitcoin from splintering into numerous assets and blockchains with different combinations of active soft forks. He believes that CTV (Consensus-enforced Transaction Validity) is the right path forward and shares seven theses supporting this belief. Jeremy's detailed post on rubin.io, which is also archived on web.archive.org, provides further insights into his proposal.Jeremy's update serves as a precursor to the upcoming CTV meeting scheduled for today. He actively encourages feedback on his proposal and expresses his openness to constructive criticism.</summary>
