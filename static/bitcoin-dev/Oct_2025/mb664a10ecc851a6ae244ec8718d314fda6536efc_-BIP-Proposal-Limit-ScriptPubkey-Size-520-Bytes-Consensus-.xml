    <summary>The core modification to fullrbf, which stands for "full replace-by-fee," was not an initiative started by the core developers themselves but rather a reaction to changes already implemented by significant miners. This adjustment within the Bitcoin network's protocol reflects a strategic alignment with existing practices rather than an original proposal from the core development team. The decision to update the core to include fullrbf came with a sense of reluctance, aimed at mitigating further complications or harm that could arise from diverging practices between miners and the protocol's core standards. This piece of information underscores the dynamic and sometimes reactive nature of cryptocurrency protocol development, where changes in practice by influential network participants can necessitate adjustments at the core protocol level. The emphasis on this process reveals the complexities involved in maintaining and developing a decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin, highlighting the interplay between various stakeholders including miners, developers, and users in shaping the evolution of the technology.</summary>
