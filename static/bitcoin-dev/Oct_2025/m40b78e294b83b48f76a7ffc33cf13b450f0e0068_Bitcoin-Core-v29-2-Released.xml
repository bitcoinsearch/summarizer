    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Core version 29.2 marks an important update available from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-29.2/). This new version brings together a collection of bug fixes, performance enhancements, and updated translations, aiming to improve the overall functionality and user experience. Users are encouraged to report any encountered bugs through the project's GitHub issue tracker, accessible via [this link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues), or join the announcement list through [Bitcoin Core's website](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).

For users upgrading from an older version, it is advised to properly shut down the current version before initiating the upgrade process. The upgrade procedure varies slightly depending on the operating system, involving running the installer on Windows, copying over necessary files on macOS, or using specific commands on Linux. It's worth noting that even versions of Bitcoin Core that have reached their end-of-life (EOL) status can be upgraded, though this may require additional time if data directory migration is necessary. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Core wallet maintains compatibility with old versions.

Bitcoin Core version 29.2 supports and has been tested on Linux Kernel versions 3.17 and above, macOS 13 and above, and Windows 10 and above. While it may operate on other Unix-like systems, these environments receive less frequent testing, and using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is generally not recommended.

This release encompasses several notable changes across different components of Bitcoin Core, including peer-to-peer networking improvements, mempool adjustments, RPC modifications, CI updates, documentation corrections, and miscellaneous enhancements. Among these updates, notable changes include the addition of a witness mutation check in P2P networking, adjustments to how the mempool enforces TRUC checks during reorganizations, fixes in RPC commands, migration of CI to hosted Cirrus Runners, and documentation fixes for better clarity and accuracy.

Acknowledgements for this release extend to a wide range of contributors who have played various roles in its development, from direct code contributions to assisting with translations. Contributors to this version include Amisha Chhajed, Eugene Siegel, fanquake, Greg Sanders, Hennadii Stepanov, Luke Dashjr, MarcoFalke, Martin Zumsande, Sebastian Falbesoner, Sjors Provoost, Vasil Dimov, and Will Clark, among others who contributed through translation efforts.</summary>
