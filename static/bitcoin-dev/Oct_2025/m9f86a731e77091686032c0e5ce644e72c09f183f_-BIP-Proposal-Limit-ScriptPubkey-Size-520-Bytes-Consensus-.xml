    <summary>The utilization of witness data for publishing on the Bitcoin blockchain presents a cost-benefit analysis that favors its use only under specific conditions. The threshold where using witness data becomes cost-effective is when publishing more than approximately 143 bytes of data. This efficiency breakpoint accounts for the initial overhead introduced by the setup transaction required to utilize witness data. Additionally, it's important to note that if an extremely straightforward proof of publication is desired, opting for witness data might not be the most economical choice despite the data size.

Historically, the debate around adjusting the OP_RETURN limit, as documented in discussions and proposed changes within the Bitcoin community, has influenced the usage patterns of OP_RETURN outputs. Despite these discussions, actual data shows a limited adoption for larger OP_RETURN outputs throughout a significant block range (from block 900,000 to block 915,843). Specifically, within this range, there were over 15 million total OP_RETURN outputs recorded, yet only a small fraction exceeded the aforementioned size thresholds. There were 131 outputs larger than 83 bytes and 81 outputs equaling or exceeding 144 bytes, highlighting a general preference or necessity towards smaller data sizes for most applications utilizing this method. Furthermore, a notable observation is the existence of 19,707 OP_RETURN outputs carrying non-zero value, emphasizing the diverse use cases and implementations within the network. For those interested in exploring the technical details or participating in ongoing discussions, further information can be found in the related [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33453issuecomment-3341177765).</summary>
