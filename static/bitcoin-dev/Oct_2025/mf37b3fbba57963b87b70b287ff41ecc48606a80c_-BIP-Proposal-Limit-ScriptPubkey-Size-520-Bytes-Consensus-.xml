    <summary>The discourse centers on the nuanced aspects of managing Layer 1 (L1) coins within the Bitcoin ecosystem, specifically targeting the optimization and reduction of non-monetary Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). These UTXOs are identified as those generated for purposes other than the intended monetary transactions, such as file storage or dusting-type tracking. The emphasis is laid on the necessity to minimize these non-essential UTXOs to alleviate unnecessary resource usage that deviates from Bitcoin's primary function as a peer-to-peer monetary system. This approach benefits various stakeholders in the Bitcoin network, including everyday users seeking secure savings storage, active users desiring efficient spending and settling mechanisms, and node operators striving to maintain network decentralization and verifiability.

The narrative further explores the implications of the unnecessary bloat in the Bitcoin network, which has resulted in an additional approximate 30 GB/year of immutable data storage since February 2023, detracting from essential improvements and security upgrades. The argument posits that by curbing this trend, future technological advancements could enable every new smartphone to run its own fully-verifying node, thereby fostering efficient and permissionless monetary transactions across both Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions. However, the challenge of competing with self-hosted Lightning Network nodes for file storage longevity is acknowledged.

A specific proposal is introduced to address the issue of "bulk dust," defined as transactions with a significant proportion of tiny outputs, which contribute to the inefficiency and bloating of the Bitcoin network. This proposal suggests making it more challenging to utilize Bitcoin for data storage and small transactions, which negatively impact the UTXO set and the network at large. The suggestion involves possibly altering consensus rules or implementing default filters to effectively identify and limit such transactions, acknowledging that while changing consensus rules is not ideal, it may be necessary to enforce solutions that the community would accept. A link to further discussion on this proposal is provided, directing readers to a [Bitcoin Development Mailing List group](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/mW_zR01joiY).</summary>
