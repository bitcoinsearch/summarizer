    <summary>The discussions and insights shared across these communications delve into the complexities of embedding data within Schnorr signatures, a topic that intersects with both technical subtleties and broader cryptographic considerations. The conversation starts with an intriguing point made by Ethan Heilman, highlighting how an embedding rate of 12% in Schnorr signatures could be seen as an 8x discount for genuine signatures versus embedded data, suggesting a potentially acceptable incentive structure. This observation raises important questions regarding the security implications of such practices, particularly around the effort required to embed malicious data, like virus signatures, through the manipulation of specific portions of 32-byte blocks.

Andrew Poelstra, from Blockstream Research, further elaborates on the technical challenges of embedding data within Schnorr signatures. He articulates skepticism about the feasibility of doing so without either grinding (a brute force method of trying many possibilities until achieving a desired outcome) or key revelation, emphasizing the inherent design of Schnorr signatures that resists forced value assignments to its components (the R EC point and the s value). Poelstra's analysis underscores the cryptographic robustness of Schnorr signatures against straightforward data embedding attempts, reinforcing their suitability for securing transactions on a blockchain.

The dialogue extends into a reflection on whether the analytical efforts to prove the unembeddability of data within Schnorr signatures are justified. Considering the possibility of achieving a 12% embedding rate through nonce and signature grinding, the discussion weighs this against the increased costs and potential security risks, such as the impact on public derivation and multisig setups with cold keys. The conversation touches on concerns related to spam and the misuse of resources by malicious actors, highlighting the nuanced balance between embedding capabilities and system integrity.

AdamISZ's contribution to the discussion introduces a focused examination of the Schnorr signature scheme, specifically regarding the potential for data embedding within the (P, R, s) tuple without resorting to grinding or side channels. By exploring the necessity of private key disclosure for data embedding, AdamISZ aims to clarify the conditions under which such actions would compromise the utxo set's integrity. This inquiry not only contributes to the technical understanding of Schnorr signatures but also addresses broader concerns about the implications of attaching signatures to every public key on the blockchain. Through this collective exploration, the participants contribute valuable insights into the ongoing development and security considerations of cryptographic practices in blockchain technology.</summary>
