    <summary>Majorian, a participant in the Bitcoin community since 2017, has proposed a compromise to address the controversies following the release of Core 30, which have sparked division within the Bitcoin community. This proposal does not aim to resolve all underlying issues but seeks to restore Bitcoin's operational state regarding the use of OP_RETURN for metadata. By suggesting a soft fork that would enforce current practices as consensus rules, Majorian hopes to ensure consistency and stability across the network.

The suggested soft fork introduces two main consensus rules: capping the OP_RETURN data size at 83 bytes and limiting transactions to one OP_RETURN output. These measures are designed to align with historical norms and reduce potential abuse while maintaining standard usage. The intention behind these rules is straightforward implementation, minimal code changes, and bridging divides within the community by addressing new attack vectors without taking a stance on what constitutes 'spam.'

Majorian emphasizes the apolitical nature of this proposal, aiming to restore Bitcoin to its operational state from just a few weeks prior, before the intensification of recent debates. By setting limits on OP_RETURN, this proposal seeks to affirm that Bitcoin is not intended as a file sharing and storage protocol, offering plausible deniability against such uses. Additionally, it aims to heal the community rift by focusing on a change that builds consensus.

Majorian invites feedback on this proposal from the Bitcoin development community, acknowledging their lack of technical expertise to write the code but expressing willingness to contribute to discussions and rally community support. The ultimate goal is to formalize this compromise as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) if it gains enough traction.</summary>
