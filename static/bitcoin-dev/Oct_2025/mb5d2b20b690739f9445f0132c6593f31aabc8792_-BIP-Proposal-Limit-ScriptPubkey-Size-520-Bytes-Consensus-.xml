    <summary>In a recent discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Russell O'Connor brought up an intriguing issue regarding bare multisig funds that were potentially trapped due to a policy change. This policy mandated that all public keys in bare multisig configurations must be on-curve points. O'Connor's mention of this problem stems from a situation that likely involved Counterparty and resulted in the inability to access these funds without direct intervention from miners. He expressed a hope that those affected by this specific policy had since managed to recover their funds.

O'Connor also highlighted his intention to verify the accuracy of his claim by reviewing IRC logs and the history of Bitcoin development. However, he opted for a more immediate approach by publicly posting the claim, inviting others with more expertise in Bitcore lore to correct him if necessary. Furthermore, he criticized the policy change as harmful and advocated for its reversal, assuming his understanding of the situation is accurate. This discussion underscores the complexities and potential unintended consequences of policy changes within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
