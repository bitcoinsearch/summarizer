    <summary>The segOP (Segregated OP_RETURN) proposal, introduced by Defenwycke in October 2025, aims to address significant inefficiencies in Bitcoin's transaction format, particularly regarding the storage and management of arbitrary on-chain data. This initiative proposes a dedicated, structured, full-fee data lane within Bitcoin transactions, drawing inspiration from the design philosophy of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The proposal seeks to ensure backward compatibility with legacy nodes, fair fee assessment, and structured data handling through a new transaction section committed cryptographically via an OP_SUCCESS184 operation.
The core of the segOP proposal involves introducing a standardized approach to on-chain metadata storage using TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding, with a cap on data size at 100 KB and the enforcement of full transaction fees for data storage. Designed as a soft fork, segOP emphasizes safety and future-proofing without necessitating a hard fork or disrupting existing operations. Key operational procedures include assembling TLV chunks into a Merkle tree for secure data commitment and including a special P2SOP output in transactions to serve as an anchor for the segOP data. This mechanism maintains the integrity and spendability of transactions under pre-segOP rules for legacy nodes while enabling enhanced data handling and verification by upgraded nodes.
Policy rules surrounding segOP transactions are crafted to maintain network health by enforcing size limits to prevent block bloat, applying full fee rates to ensure fairness, and conducting standardness checks for uniform behavior across the network. Nodes validate segOP transactions by detecting segOP sections, verifying compliance with size and fee requirements, and confirming the accuracy of the Merkle root against the committed data. The proposal also outlines how segOP transactions would be integrated within the broader Bitcoin network, including their relay, inclusion in blocks, and potential exposure through RPC or indexing APIs by miners. Additionally, the implications for light clients are discussed, highlighting the benefits of the Merkle structure for efficient proof requests and verifications.
The segOP initiative represents a holistic effort to enhance Bitcoin's data handling capabilities by introducing a structured, fair-fee, and backward-compatible mechanism for on-chain data storage. By addressing challenges such as witness discount abuse and unstructured data, segOP lays the foundation for future innovations in Bitcoin transaction processing and metadata management.</summary>
