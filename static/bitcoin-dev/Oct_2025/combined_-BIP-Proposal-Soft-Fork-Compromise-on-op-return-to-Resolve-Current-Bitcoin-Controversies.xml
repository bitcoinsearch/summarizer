    <summary>In the ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin community, particularly following the release of Core 30, a significant proposal has been put forth by Majorian, an active participant in the bitcoin space since 2017. Majorian's proposal aims to address the controversies and divisions that have emerged by suggesting a soft fork that would impose specific limitations on OP_RETURN usage, a feature historically used for embedding metadata within transactions. The proposed soft fork seeks to cap OP_RETURN data size at 83 bytes and limit transactions to one OP_RETURN output each. This initiative is designed to codify and enforce the historical relay norms at the consensus level, thereby preserving Bitcoin's operational integrity and stability.
The rationale behind this proposal is multifaceted. Firstly, it emphasizes simplicity in implementation and verification, with minimal code changes needed. It strives to mitigate potential new attack vectors by tightening OP_RETURN usage in accordance with its historical application, thus avoiding complications related to spam without taking a stance on it. Importantly, the proposal is presented as apolitical and restorative, aiming to revert Bitcoin to its state prior to the intensification of recent debates, without aligning with any particular implementations such as Core or Knots. Moreover, by enforcing these limitations, the proposal also introduces plausible deniability regarding Bitcoin's design intentions, specifically countering the notion that it serves as a peer-to-peer file sharing and storage protocol through OP_RETURN usage. Ultimately, this approach seeks to foster community healing and refocus efforts on Bitcoin's future development, with Majorian expressing openness to formalizing this idea into a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), despite not being able to code it personally.
Subsequent responses from the mailing list highlight varying perspectives on the issue. Russell O'Connor raises concerns about the effectiveness of combating spam through OP_RETURN restrictions, noting the prevalence of spam in UTXOs and suggesting alternative measures such as block size reduction and UTXO-sharing opcodes. These suggestions aim to alleviate node runner expenses, enhance decentralization, and deter spammers more effectively than merely capping OP_RETURN. 
Erik Aronesty critiques the original proposal as lacking compromise, pointing out that protocols requiring data publication exceeding 80 bytes will be adversely affected. Capping OP_RETURN, according to Aronesty, could lead users toward using bare multisig outputs for data publication, resulting in higher fees, bloated UTXO sets, and an inability to distinguish between legitimate and bulletin board usage of bare multisigs. Aronesty argues that Core 30 addresses existing issues and that rolling back these changes would exacerbate problems by pushing users towards alternatives that are less desirable for the community and network health.
These exchanges reflect the complexity of balancing innovation, tradition, and practicality within Bitcoin's development ethos, underscoring the need for careful consideration of proposals and their potential impacts on the network and its stakeholders.</summary>
