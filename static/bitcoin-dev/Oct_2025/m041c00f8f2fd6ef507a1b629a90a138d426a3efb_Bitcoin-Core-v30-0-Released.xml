    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Core version 30.0 introduces several new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations, available for download at [https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.0/](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.0/). Users are encouraged to report any bugs via the GitHub issue tracker at [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues). This version marks the end of maintenance for versions 27.x and older, with a forthcoming disclosure of vulnerabilities fixed in recent updates, highlighting the commitment to security and transparency in the development process.

Upgrading to this new version is straightforward but requires shutting down older versions completely before proceeding with the installation. The upgrade process supports direct transitions from versions that have reached their end-of-life (EOL), although users might experience delays if data directory migrations are necessary. Compatibility is assured for operating systems using Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+, with limited testing on other Unix-like systems.

Significant changes in policy include a limitation on legacy signature operations per transaction, an increase in the data carrier size for OP_RETURN outputs, and adjustments to minimum block and relay fee rates, reflecting a careful balance between network health and user costs. Network enhancements focus on mempool management, orphan transaction handling, and improved package relay mechanisms, ensuring robustness against denial-of-service attacks and enhancing transaction propagation.

The introduction of a unified `bitcoin` command line tool simplifies interaction with different functionalities like the node, GUI, and RPC calls, making features more accessible without altering existing commands. Additionally, support for external signing on Windows has been reinstated, and an experimental IPC Mining Interface is introduced, catering to advanced use cases involving custom mining software.

Installation processes have been refined, including changes to executable placements and handling of upgrades on Windows, emphasizing ease of use and system compatibility. Notable modifications in indexing and logging aim to improve performance and user experience, with significant updates to the coinstatsindex implementation and rate-limited unconditional logging to disk.

RPC adjustments deprecate certain commands in favor of more dynamic fee estimation methods and introduce new functionalities, such as the REST API endpoint for fetching spent transaction outputs efficiently. Changes in build system configurations reflect ongoing efforts to optimize resource usage and network connectivity across diverse environments.

The wallet undergoes substantial changes, notably discontinuing support for BDB legacy wallets in favor of descriptor wallets, streamlining wallet management, and enhancing transaction capabilities with support for TRUC transactions. GUI updates leverage Qt 6 for improved platform support and aesthetic coherence.

This release represents a collective effort from numerous contributors, underscoring the collaborative nature of Bitcoin Core's development. The comprehensive list of acknowledgments highlights the wide range of expertise and dedication within the community, driving continuous improvement and innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
