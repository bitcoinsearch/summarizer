    <summary>The discourse surrounding the definition of money, especially in relation to Bitcoin, highlights its subjective nature, a perspective reinforced by historical accounts divergent from those offered by figures such as Saifedean. The attempt to steer Bitcoin's development based on a singular definition of money is critiqued for potentially opening vulnerabilities similar to those encountered in combating spam. This issue is further complicated by the comparison between the widely recognized assertion that Bitcoin is peer-to-peer (p2p) money and the simplified claim "Bitcoin is money." Such discussions underscore the complexities and challenges in defining Bitcoin within the traditional frameworks of money, emphasizing the nuances and debates inherent in its evolution and perception within financial and technological circles.</summary>
