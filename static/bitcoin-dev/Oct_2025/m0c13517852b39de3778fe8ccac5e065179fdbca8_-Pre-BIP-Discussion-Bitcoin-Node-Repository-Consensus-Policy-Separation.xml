    <summary>Juan Alemán introduces himself to the Bitcoin developer community, sharing his background as an investor and developer in Bitcoin since 2017. He addresses concerns regarding the recent controversial changes in version 30 of the Bitcoin Core defaults, which significantly diverge from historical standards. Alemán points out that these changes have led to discussions about a possible network fork, suggesting instead that reverting the defaults could avoid such drastic measures. He emphasizes that the core of the issue lies not within the technical realm but rather in the social-political influence exerted by the centralized repository of the "Official Reference Implementation."

Alemán proposes a structural change to the Bitcoin repository to mitigate undue political influence on policy decisions. His plan involves renaming the existing Bitcoin Core repository to bitcoin/bitcoin-core and refocusing it exclusively on consensus rules, thereby separating it from policy-based node distribution. This shift aims to decentralize the influence over default policies and ensure the repository serves as a neutral platform for all node implementations.

Furthermore, Alemán suggests creating a new repository for a full-featured node client, starting with bitcoin/bitcoin-node, which would include the consensus-focused components of bitcoin-core while also allowing for the incorporation of recommended default policies by current core developers. This approach is designed to accommodate various client needs and preferences, potentially leading to the coexistence of multiple bitcoin-node-type repositories tailored to different default policies.

By implementing these changes, Alemán believes that the Bitcoin-Core project can achieve its true potential, focusing on a robust consensus core that benefits all clients regardless of their policy stance. Such a reorganization would reduce the central repository's impact on policy decisions, aligning better with Bitcoin's decentralized ethos. However, he acknowledges the potential drawbacks, including disruptions to existing infrastructure and the necessity of careful management to prevent misuse of the original repository name, which could interfere with GitHub's automatic URL redirects. Alemán concludes his proposal by inviting feedback from the community, hoping to find a compromise that accommodates all viewpoints without forcing compliance.</summary>
