    <summary>Doctor Buzz expressed frustration over a GitHub moderator's decision to close his nearly complete code, directing him to find another venue for it. Despite this setback, he shared links to provide further insights into his work. The original GitHub post that sparked the discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33737issuecomment-3465288829), showcasing the initial concept that was introduced without garnering any response on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange forum, available at [this link](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/129139/would-a-bulk-dust-relay-consensus-rule-limiting-100-sub-1-000-sat-outputs-p). Additionally, Doctor Buzz suggested that the code might be more appealing in its presentation on Pastebin, which can be accessed [here](https://pastebin.com/9qdQCH83). This incident unfolded within the context of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List group, indicating the technical and community-driven aspects of cryptocurrency development projects.</summary>
