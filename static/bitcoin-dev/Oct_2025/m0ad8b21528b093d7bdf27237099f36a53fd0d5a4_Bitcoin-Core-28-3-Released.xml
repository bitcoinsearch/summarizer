    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin Core, 28.3, is now available for download. This can be accessed directly through the provided [link](http://bitcoincore.org/bin/) or via BitTorrent with the detailed magnet link included in the original announcement. This release brings a series of bug fixes and performance improvements alongside updated translations to enhance user experience and system functionality.

In terms of upgrades, users operating on older versions are advised to shut down their current version completely before initiating the upgrade process. This might require a few minutes for a full shutdown, depending on the system. For installation, Windows users should run the installer, macOS users should replace `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt`, and Linux users should update `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt`. It's noted that upgrading from a version that has reached its end-of-life (EOL) could take extra time if the data directory needs migration. However, old wallet versions remain generally supported by the new release.

Compatibility is extensively assured for systems running on Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 or newer. While Bitcoin Core is likely to function on other UNIX-like systems, these environments are not tested as rigorously. The use of Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended due to potential compatibility issues.

Notable changes within this version include modifications to the mempool and policy settings. Specifically, the minimum block feerate (`-blockmintxfee`) has been adjusted to 1 satoshi per kvB, with the capability for users to alter this setting if needed. Similarly, default minimum relay feerate (`-minrelaytxfee`) and incremental relay feerate (`-incrementalrelayfee`) have been updated to 100 satoshis per kvB. Users are encouraged to adjust both settings simultaneously should they choose to modify them. Despite these changes, other minimum feerates, such as dust feerate and those utilized by the wallet, remain unaltered. It's important to note that transactions created with lower fee rates may not propagate or confirm unless these new defaults gain widespread network adoption.

Additional updates cover various aspects from P2P communication tweaks, test improvements fixing specific errors and enhancing reliability, to build system adjustments ensuring smoother operations and addressing issues with dependency links. Documentation has also been refined, correcting inaccuracies and updating information to reflect the current state of the system, like the activation status of taproot.

Acknowledgment is given to all contributors who played a part in this release, highlighting the collaborative effort from developers, translators, and the wider community engaged through platforms like Transifex. This collective input continues to drive the development and refinement of Bitcoin Core, ensuring it remains a robust and evolving digital currency platform.</summary>
