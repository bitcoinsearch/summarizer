    <summary>The increasing popularity of Bitcoin Core v30 has necessitated the advancement of [luke-jr's ML proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2017), aimed at temporarily limiting arbitrary data at the consensus level. This move, underscored by a consensus without objections for three weeks, emphasizes bitcoin's primary function as a currency rather than a data storage solution. The proposal introduces a temporary soft fork with two distinct activation methods: proactive and reactive, set to expire after one year. This period is intended to provide ample time to devise a more enduring solution.

The urgency of implementing this proposal stems from a tight timeline, encouraging community support for a swift and organized activation process. Feedback is actively sought, with an open invitation for comments on the proposal and direct communications via email. Additionally, there's a call to action for individuals with technical expertise willing to contribute to development and testing efforts. This initiative reinforces the fundamental view of bitcoin as money, seeking widespread collaboration within the community to ensure its effective realization.</summary>
