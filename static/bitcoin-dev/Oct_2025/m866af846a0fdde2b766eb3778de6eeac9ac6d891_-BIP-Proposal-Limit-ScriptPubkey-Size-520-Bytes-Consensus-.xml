    <summary>In the correspondence regarding Bitcoin development, Andrew Poelstra and Brandon engaged in a discussion about a proposed idea within the community. Andrew expressed support for the idea, noting that a common argument against it is that users might end up utilizing more outputs. However, he dismissed this concern by highlighting that witness size isn't limited in such a manner that would make this a significant issue. Furthermore, Andrew pointed out the benefit of the proposal in potentially circumventing the complications associated with avoiding Denial of Service (DOS) attacks when using GCC. The tone of the conversation was positive, with Andrew concluding that if the proposal could indeed sidestep these technical hurdles, it should be pursued. This exchange underscores an ongoing effort to refine and enhance Bitcoin's underlying technology, specifically addressing concerns related to scalability and security.</summary>
