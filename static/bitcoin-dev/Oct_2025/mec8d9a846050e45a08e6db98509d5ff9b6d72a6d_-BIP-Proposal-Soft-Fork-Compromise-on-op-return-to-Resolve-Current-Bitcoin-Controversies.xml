    <summary>In recent discussions within the Bitcoin Development community, a significant concern has been raised regarding the limitations placed on OP_RETURN outputs, specifically the proposal to cap these at 80 bytes and restrict them to one per transaction. This restriction has been identified as problematic for several protocols that require publishing data exceeding this limit, often stretching into hundreds of bytes. The crux of the issue lies in the forced migration of users towards alternative methods for data publication, such as utilizing bare multisig outputs, should these caps be implemented. This shift not only imposes higher transaction fees on the users of these protocols but also contributes to the ballooning of everyone's UTXO sets with transactions that are essentially unspendable. Moreover, distinguishing between bare multisigs used as an unofficial bulletin board and those serving legitimate purposes becomes increasingly challenging.

The debate is framed around the unintended consequences of attempting to address what was initially perceived as a necessity to curb certain uses of the blockchain. Proposals aimed at limiting the capacity for data publication within transactions, particularly through mechanisms like OP_RETURN, inadvertently promote the adoption of less desirable alternatives. These include not only bare multisigs but potentially other methods that have yet to be fully explored or understood, all of which could further complicate the blockchain's operational integrity and user experience.

A soft fork that enforces such restrictions is viewed critically by parts of the community. It is argued that, rather than solving the problem at hand, it exacerbates the situation by pushing users towards solutions that are uncensorable but significantly less efficient or transparent. Such changes could undermine the progress made by Bitcoin Core 30 in addressing these very issues, signaling a step backward rather than forward in the development and optimization of the network's functionality.</summary>
