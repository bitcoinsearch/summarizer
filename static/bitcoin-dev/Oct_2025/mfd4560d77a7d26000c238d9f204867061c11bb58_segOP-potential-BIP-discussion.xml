    <summary>The document presents a detailed proposal named segOP (Segregated OP_RETURN), aimed at addressing the current fee market distortion in Bitcoin caused by the Segregated Witness (SegWit) discount. This distortion has led to an unfair economic environment where large amounts of data, such as images and metadata inscriptions, are stored on the blockchain at a fraction of the cost they should incur, thereby reducing miner revenue and increasing transaction queue times for genuine users.

segOP proposes a solution that restores balance to the fee market without requiring a hard fork. It introduces a structured, fully-priced data lane within Bitcoin transactions that allows for the inclusion of arbitrary data up to 100 KB per transaction, with each byte costing the same as regular transaction data. This approach is intended to double miner revenue and increase genuine payment throughput by approximately 75%, while naturally reducing spam transactions. The mechanism is backward compatible, soft-fork safe, easily prunable, and ensures economic fairness by making every byte of data pay its way equally.

The current situation results from the four-million-weight-unit block limit introduced to price block space fairly, which was distorted by the introduction of SegWit. SegWit's witness discount inadvertently subsidized the storage of non-transactional data on the blockchain, leading to lost revenue for miners and longer wait times for users. segOP addresses these issues by reintroducing equal pricing for all data stored on the blockchain, thus aiming to create a fairer and more efficient fee market.

Economic models outlined in the proposal demonstrate the potential benefits of implementing segOP. Compared to the current state, where a significant portion of a block's weight can be consumed by discounted witness data, the adoption of segOP would result in blocks that contain a healthier mix of transactional and non-transactional data, thereby increasing overall network efficiency and miner profitability. This is achieved by removing the subsidy for large data payloads, making it economically unfeasible to abuse the system with spam.

Furthermore, the document discusses the technical implementation of segOP, including the encoding structure, flag bits for signaling segOP transactions, and a detailed example of a transaction incorporating segOP. It also explores the long-term implications for storage and pruning strategies, suggesting that segOP data can be safely pruned after validation, which helps maintain a manageable blockchain size without sacrificing data integrity or network consensus.

Finally, the proposal outlines various operational profiles for nodes, ranging from lightweight home nodes to full archival nodes, demonstrating segOP's flexibility in accommodating different user needs and hardware capabilities. By allowing for selective data retention and pruning, segOP provides a scalable solution for managing blockchain growth while ensuring that the network remains accessible and economically viable for all participants.

In conclusion, segOP represents a thoughtful and technically robust proposal to rectify the imbalances created by SegWit's witness discount. By enforcing fair pricing for all data on the blockchain, segOP aims to improve the Bitcoin network's economic model, enhance miner incentives, and ensure a more equitable allocation of block space, thereby supporting the long-term health and scalability of the network.</summary>
