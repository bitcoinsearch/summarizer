    <summary>In an email thread from 2011, Geir Harald Hansen raised concerns about duplicated strings in the Bitcoin software. He provided three examples of duplicated strings with minor differences between them. John Smith acknowledged that some strings may need to be duplicated based on context but questioned if it was necessary in these cases. Christian Decker suggested that different translations based on context could explain the duplicates. The discussion then shifted to using Transifex for translations and coordinating translation efforts.The conversation revolved around the translation of Bitcoin software into different languages. Geir Harald Hansen reported translating some strings but had to translate the exact same strings multiple times. Nils Schneider suggested using Transifex for translation and exported all .ts files to the platform. Geir Harald Hansen offered to translate Norwegian Bokmål if it was added to Transifex. Chris pointed out that the same string may need different translations depending on the context they appear in. The conversation ended with a link to a Cisco networking self-assessment and information about the Bitcoin-development mailing list.The discussion focused on coordinating translation efforts for the Bitcoin project. Geir Harald Hansen requested the addition of Norwegian Bokmål to the languages on Transifex. Nils Schneider suggested adding translations through the "add translation" feature on Transifex. Geir agreed to translate using the language code "nb." The conversation concluded with an ad from Cisco promoting their self-assessment program for IT networking professionals.A member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list sought help in coordinating translation efforts. Nils Schneider had exported all .ts files to Transifex, providing a link for contributions. Geir Harald Hansen offered to translate into Norwegian Bokmål if it was added to the platform. The email also included an ad for Cisco's Learning program and a link to sign up for more information.On October 22, 2011, Nils Schneider requested a volunteer to coordinate translation efforts for Bitcoin. He suggested using Transifex and creating documentation to simplify the process. Geir Harald Hansen offered to translate into Norwegian Bokmål and requested the language code "nb" be added. Schneider had already exported all .ts files to Transifex, providing a project page link.The Bitcoin project sought someone to coordinate translation efforts using Transifex and create documentation to simplify the process. All .ts files had been exported to Transifex, with a provided link. Updating translations from Transifex to Github was simplified with the command "tx pull &amp;&amp; git add src/qt/locale/* &amp;&amp; git commit src/qt/locale/ &amp;&amp; git push."On October 10, 2011, Mike Hearn announced the decision to no longer use bitcoind for Eligius. Custom software would handle primary pool operations more efficiently while bitcoind would focus on peering and selecting valid transactions. The custom software would handle tasks like incrementing extraNonce and recalculating the merkle tree/root.The operator of the Eligius mining pool decided to replace bitcoind with custom software for more efficient work creation. Bitcoind would still be used for peering and selecting valid transactions. The custom software would handle additional tasks like incrementing extraNonce and recalculating the merkle tree/root.In an email conversation, Luke-Jr mentioned the plan to no longer use bitcoind for Eligius soon. Mike Hearn clarified that bitcoind would still serve its purpose but not be involved in primary pool operations.Luke-Jr, the operator of the Eligius mining pool, announced the discontinuation of bitcoind for Eligius. The reason behind this decision was not specified. It was questioned if bitcoind was required for running a mining pool, although most pools utilized it. Alternative software suggestions were made, such as CGMiner, BFGMiner, and DiabloMiner.In October 2011, Luke-Jr requested the merging of Coinbaser for the 0.5 version of Bitcoind. It had undergone extensive testing on Eligius, fulfilling the request for community support for the new JSON-RPC call. Gavin was unwilling to merge it despite its readiness and testing. Luke-Jr hoped it would be merged to the 0.6 git before requiring a rebase.The author requested the merging of Coinbaser for version 0.5 of Bitcoind due to extensive testing and community support. The author no longer used bitcoind for Eligius, making maintaining/rebasing Coinbaser across a 0.6 development period unnecessary.Gavin Andresen sought help in writing new translations for Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5 Release Candidate 1. Existing translations for the old wxWidgets Bitcoin were obsolete. QT Linguist or Transifex could be used for translations. Coordination and documentation efforts were needed. Thiago offered to translate to Brazilian Portuguese.Gavin Andresen requested assistance in writing new translations for Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5 Release</summary>
