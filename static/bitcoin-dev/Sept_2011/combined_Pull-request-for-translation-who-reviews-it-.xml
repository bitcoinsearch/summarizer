    <summary>David, a user from Bitcoin.se, has posted a question on the forums seeking guidance on how to improve the Swedish translation of the client. However, he expresses concern that his request may go unnoticed or be disregarded due to the overwhelming amount of irrelevant content on the forums. David is unsure if his proposed improvements will be accepted since there are few individuals in the project who can accurately assess the quality of the Swedish translation.In response to David's query, it is explained that translation updates are typically implemented without thorough evaluation unless someone objects to them. The previous Swedish translations were credited to an individual named Codler; however, it is clarified that no specific person is officially responsible for translations within the Bitcoin project. It is suggested that participants should strive to keep their translations up-to-date when submitting new ones.Furthermore, David seeks information regarding a list of individuals who have the authority to make a pull request. He is informed that anyone can make a pull request, but only Gavin, tcatm, sipa, jgarzik, and alexwaters have the capability to push to the bitcoin repository and consequently accept a pull request.Overall, David is looking for support in improving the Swedish translation of the client and addressing concerns about the evaluation process. He also seeks clarity on the individuals empowered to make a pull request.</summary>
