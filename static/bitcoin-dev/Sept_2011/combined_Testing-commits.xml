    <summary>In September 2011, Alex Waters was focused on creating a stable build environment for testers. His tasks included building Bitcoin 4.0 source in both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11. To ensure user-facing quality, he expressed concern about the software's beta-like quality and aimed to improve it. Alex planned to create a package of the build dependencies and upload them to SF (SourceForge). He mentioned using an outdated but still functional guide from bitcointalk.org, along with updated instructions available on the same forum. For the Windows build, Alex believed that no package was necessary as relevant packages could be apt-getted. However, he acknowledged the availability of good documentation on doc/build-unix.txt, which was somewhat ubuntu-specific. To facilitate testing, Alex compiled a list of commits that needed testing in both environments. He encouraged users to link pull requests in response to https://github.com/alexwaters/bitcoin/issues/2. He also offered to automate the testing process through jenkins.bluematt.me, making it easier for those feeling lazy. This automation would produce builds similar to those from gitian.Alex suggested that automated testing scripts could be modified to automatically sanity-test pull requests as they came in, catching common errors or failures. Although not mandatory for pull requests, this prioritization system would expedite the processing of important and easy ones. Alex was open to discussing alternative ways of prioritizing pull requests, but currently, this system seemed effective.</summary>
