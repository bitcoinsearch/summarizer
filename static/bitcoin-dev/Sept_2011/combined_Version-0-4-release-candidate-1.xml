    <summary>On September 2, 2011, Gavin Andresen introduced the Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 and encouraged users to participate in initial testing. The source code was made available on Github, allowing users to examine and potentially identify any vulnerabilities. This release brought about a significant change by enabling wallet private key encryption, although it was not activated by default. In addition to the visible update, there was also an underlying modification that addressed a persistent issue with bitcoind, where it would become unresponsive due to deadlocks. This improvement involved reworking the internal critical section mutexes. A user expressed their appreciation for this overhaul, highlighting the necessity of such changes. They were delighted to witness the sudden progress of the project.To facilitate thorough testing, interested users are urged to download the Bitcoin version 0.4 release candidate 1 source code from GitHub. It is important to note that wallet private key encryption is not automatically enabled upon installation. Furthermore, the reworking of internal critical section mutexes aims to resolve longstanding problems related to system responsiveness during deadlocks.For a comprehensive list of changes introduced in this release, users can execute the command &quot;git shortlog --no-merges v0.3.24.&quot; The development team acknowledges and expresses gratitude towards all contributors who submitted patches for consideration, even though not all submissions made it into this particular release.</summary>
