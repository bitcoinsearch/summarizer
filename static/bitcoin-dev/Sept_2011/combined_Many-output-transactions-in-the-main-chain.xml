    <summary>In September 2011, Gavin Andresen raised an alarm about an individual inserting transactions with numerous outputs into the primary Bitcoin blockchain. The address in question can be viewed on Blockexplorer. This activity poses a potential problem as it could result in the creation of transactions with thousands of inputs, leading to excessive disk space usage. To address this issue, Andresen offered a patch on Github. However, he also sought suggestions on how to effectively inform merchants, miners, and pools about the situation. While he preferred not to delay the release of version 0.4 by re-spinning 0.3.24 with the patch, it may ultimately be necessary to do so.</summary>
