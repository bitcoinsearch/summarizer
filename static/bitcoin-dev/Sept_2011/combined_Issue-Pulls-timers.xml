    <summary>A proposal has been put forward to introduce timers on the pulls/issues in the Bitcoin GitHub repository. The objective is to address the issue of outdated pull requests and issues by automatically closing them after 15 days if they are no longer mergeable, unless the commit is rebased. In addition, non-bug issues without any commits will also be closed after 15 days from their last activity. These closed pull requests and issues will be labeled as &quot;stagnant&quot; and &quot;stale,&quot; respectively.To avoid abruptly closing a pull request or issue, contributors will receive automated warning emails that provide a general overview of the policy and include links to resources on how to rebase a commit and adhere to standard expectations. The intention behind this approach is to ensure that contributors are aware of the process and have the opportunity to prevent automated closures. Jeff Garzik has recommended avoiding closing pull requests and issues without prior warning.Furthermore, in order to reopen closed pull requests or issues, individuals can submit requests to QA at BitcoinTesting.org. This initiative aims to streamline the repository by clearing out older pulls and issues while improving the quality assurance process to prevent backlogs caused by lack of testing. It is worth noting that QA at BitcoinTesting.org differs from QA at Bitcoin.org, which is mentioned as a side note in the context.Overall, the proposed addition of timers seeks to manage and prioritize pulls and issues, reducing the number of abandoned and stagnant items and focusing attention on more important changes.</summary>
