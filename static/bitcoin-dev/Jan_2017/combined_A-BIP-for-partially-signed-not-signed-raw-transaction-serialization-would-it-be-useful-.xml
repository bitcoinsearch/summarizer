    <summary>In January 2017, Jon proposed gathering opinions before submitting a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to address the issue of different methodologies used for serializing partially signed multisig raw transactions. This problem was observed in projects like Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, and Bitcoin Core. Thomas Kerin recommended that Jon should consider his previous work on a similar BIP for hardware signing and suggested using a protocol for requesting signatures, particularly suitable for BitGo and GreenAddress wallets.The context provided is a PGP public key block, which contains a long string of characters representing the actual public key and metadata about the key. This metadata includes the associated email address, creation date, and algorithm used to generate the key. PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, is an encryption tool used for secure messaging over the internet. It requires users to generate a key pair consisting of a public and private key. The public key can be shared, while the private key must be kept secret. Messages can be encrypted using the recipient's public key, ensuring only the intended recipient can decrypt and read them.The need for a standardized specification for unsigned transactions arises from the different serialization methodologies used in partially signed multisig raw transactions and not-signed raw transactions across various projects. Jon, known as 木ノ下じょな on bitcoin-dev, has encountered similar issues with multisig support. To eliminate friction caused by these differences, a standardized specification is proposed to ensure consistent serialization of unsigned transactions. The signature section of the transaction should contain all necessary information for making the signature. The proposal aims to have all unsigned transactions follow the same form and be encoded in a way that signing applications can recognize them as unsigned.Prior to proposing a BIP, Jon sought opinions to assess the need for a standardized specification.</summary>
