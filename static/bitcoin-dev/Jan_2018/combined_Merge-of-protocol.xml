    <summary>The discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list revolved around the technical feasibility of merging two blockchain protocols to create a new coin that combines the strengths of both. While it is technically possible for communities behind two coins to merge, the process is challenging and risky, requiring agreement from each coin's community as well as between the two communities. This would involve creating a merge block with two parents, resulting in a hard fork on both chains.2017 witnessed numerous forks in the cryptocurrency world, making the idea of merging altcoins with bitcoin or with each other more prominent. The ongoing development of the Lightning Network also played a role in prompting altcoin communities to consider merging with bitcoin. However, despite the interest and potential benefits, the initial post did not provide any concrete resources or ideas on how to proceed with such mergers.Overall, the discussion highlighted the technical possibilities and challenges associated with merging different blockchain protocols to create new coins with enhanced capabilities.</summary>
