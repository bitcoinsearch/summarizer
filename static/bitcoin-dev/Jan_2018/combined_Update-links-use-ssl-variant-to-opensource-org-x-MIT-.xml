    <summary>Felix Wolfsteller expressed disappointment with the feedback he received off-list, acknowledging that the mailing list is intended for protocol-only discussions. He provided a link to track the progress of his proposal, which aims to update the copyright-header in source files by replacing HTTP with HTTPS where possible. To address this issue, he suggested creating an issue on Github, using the command 'sed -i' to modify relevant links, creating a pull request on Github, and then returning to the mailing list.The proposed change would impact several hundred files, potentially requiring an extension of the copyright year to 2018. Currently, most of the source files have a &quot;default&quot; copyright header that indicates the location of the MIT license. However, the provided link uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, resulting in a redirect to https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php. The proposer believes that creating an issue on GitHub, using `sed -i` to update the links, creating a pull request, and seeking feedback from the mailing list would be the appropriate approach.To provide an example, Felix shared a header from a file in the Bitcoin codebase. This example can be viewed at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a9a49e6e7e8df13d80a6dc3245ce7ef041942e9b/src/consensus/merkle.cpp#L3. Although the proposer seeks prompt feedback, they express uncertainty about the cultural norms surrounding this process.</summary>
