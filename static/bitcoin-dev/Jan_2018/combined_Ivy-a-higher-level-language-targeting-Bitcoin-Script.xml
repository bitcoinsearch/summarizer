    <summary>The Ivy team has released a prototype higher-level language and development environment called Ivy for creating custom Bitcoin Script programs. Ivy aims to improve the usability of Bitcoin Script by adding features like named variables and clauses, static types, and a familiar syntax for function calls. It is a simple smart contract language that can compile to Bitcoin Script. However, there was an issue with how the compiler was handling clause selection that led to a minor witness malleability problem. This problem has been fixed in version 0.0.7 of the compiler. To prevent witness malleability, a user suggested adding some form of compiler-time enforcement, but the team believes it would be easier to build a static analyzer for low-level Bitcoin Script.Ivy is currently a prototype software intended for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used to control real or testnet Bitcoins. The Ivy Playground for Bitcoin allows users to create and test simulated contracts in a sandboxed environment. By providing a higher-level language and development environment, Ivy offers a more user-friendly approach to writing Bitcoin scripts and potentially resolving witness malleability issues.</summary>
