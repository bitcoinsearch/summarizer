    <summary>In a mailing list post, dexx suggests raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher as a means to discourage the use of harmful methods for embedding data into the blockchain. Currently, methods such as P2SH and bare-multisig can be cheaper in terms of effective transaction size compared to using OP_RETURN scripts, which are the most common way of embedding data. However, both Omni and Counterparty, two major meta-protocols on top of Bitcoin, have already transitioned to using OP_RETURN for data embedding.Although token sends are typically done one by one with a single transaction, this places a heavy burden on the network when exchanges send out withdrawals. While there are solutions available for "multi-sends with multi-inputs," they require more space. To address this issue, dexx proposes raising the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes or higher. This would make OP_RETURN scripts the cheapest method for data embedding, potentially incentivizing their use and reducing the load on the network.During December 2017, there were approximately 210,000 Omni Layer transactions, with over 12,000 transactions occurring on peak days. It is assumed that Counterparty transactions have similar numbers. With these statistics in mind, it is likely that both protocols would benefit from additional payload space provided by an increase in the default datacarriersize.Dexx expresses their willingness to provide a pull request if there is positive feedback regarding the proposal. This indicates their commitment to implementing the suggested change if it is deemed favorable by the community.</summary>
