    <summary>The discussion revolves around the use of BIP39 and subsequent BIPs, which are often used incorrectly and can mislead people. Some wallets have limitations when it comes to validating English words or typing characters. There is a proposal to enhance the BIP39 wordlist set by specifying canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist, as well as short ASCII language codes. This would facilitate language identification in user interface options or menus and promote interface consistency between implementations.Sjors Provoost disagrees with the inclusion of language-specific word lists in the current BIP39 standard due to concerns about supporting multiple languages and vendor lock-in. He suggests creating a new standard where words are mapped to integers rather than literal strings, with a mapping from original language words to matching English words. This would allow users to enter a mnemonic into a hardware wallet that only supports English.There are also discussions about the need for a better English dictionary in the replacement for BIP39, with suggestions such as all words being 4-8 characters and having unique 4-character prefixes. Wallets would need to distinguish between the old and new standards, and un-upgraded BIP39 wallets should consider all new mnemonics invalid.Additionally, there is a suggestion to add canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist set in the BIP39 specification. This would help with language identification in user interfaces and promote consistency between implementations. The author also notes the absence of a Dutch word list in the BIP repository and expresses interest in adding more word lists.The conversation highlighted the limited support for non-English languages in current wallets, which can lead to vendor lock-in and potential loss of funds if a non-English wallet becomes unavailable. It was suggested that wallets should be able to distinguish between the old and new standard, considering all new mnemonics invalid for un-upgraded BIP39 wallets.In conclusion, the discussion emphasized the importance of considering the needs of non-English speaking users when designing standards for cryptocurrency wallets. The issues raised included the difficulties faced by Japanese users with English words, the potential risks of using mnemonics, and the need for multi-language support. There were various proposals put forward, including mapping words to integers, enhancing wordlists with additional information, and improving language identification strings. Overall, the conversation called for a more inclusive and accessible approach to securing coins.The context also provides links related to passwords, anti-spying, private torrents, blocklists, and different wallets, including options for simplifying Bitcoin transactions and wallets, as well as tools for encrypting and protecting data.</summary>
