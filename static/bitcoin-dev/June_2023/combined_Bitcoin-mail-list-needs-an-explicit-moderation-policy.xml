    <summary>Dr. Maxim Orlovsky, a long-time contributor to the bitcoin community, has raised concerns about the lack of clear moderation policies on the bitcoin-dev mail list. In an email to the list, Dr. Orlovsky proposed several changes to address these concerns. Firstly, he suggested that a clear peer-review policy should be established and made public after discussion within the mail list. This would ensure transparency and fairness in the moderation process. Secondly, Dr. Orlovsky recommended replacing the current moderator, Bryan Bishop, with someone selected from a list of potential candidates using the criteria of &quot;least votes against.&quot; The new moderator's role would be purely executive, without any personal preferences or biases.Furthermore, Dr. Orlovsky proposed the creation of a dedicated mail list called &quot;bitcoin-dev-unmoderated&quot; where all submissions would be published without moderation. This list would be read only by individuals interested in auditing the bitcoin-dev main mail list for non-censorship. To incentivize moderators, Dr. Orlovsky suggested that their reputation should play a key role. This would ensure that moderators are motivated to enforce the policies effectively and fairly.In his email, Dr. Orlovsky provided evidence of the lack of explicit moderation policies and the abuse of power by the current moderator. He referred to the rejection of one of his own posts as an example of censorship, implying that it was based on personal preferences rather than the quality of the content.The email included links to Dr. Orlovsky's previous contributions to the bitcoin community and Twitter conversations that highlighted the need for explicit moderation policies. These tweets also demonstrated the frustration caused by the lack of transparency in the moderation process.In response to Dr. Orlovsky's concerns, Bryan Bishop questioned the allegations of abuse and suggested that the issue may be related to moderation queue latency rather than personal bias. He mentioned asking Dr. Orlovsky to stop tagging him on a particular topic, which may have caused some tension between them.Overall, the email exchange between Dr. Maxim Orlovsky and Bryan Bishop underscores the need for clear moderation policies and unbiased enforcement on the bitcoin-dev mail list. The proposed changes aim to ensure transparency, fairness, and effective discussion among developers in the bitcoin community.</summary>
