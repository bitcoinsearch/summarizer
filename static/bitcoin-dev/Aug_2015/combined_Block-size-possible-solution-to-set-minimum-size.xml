    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bdimych Bdimych raised concerns about the CoreXT fork and its vulnerability to double spending. He suggested implementing a minimum block size to prevent this issue and proposed filling the free space with zeroes and compressing them. However, Jorge Tim贸n responded that a minimum block size would not address the problems associated with schism hardforks. He explained that miners could easily cheat the system by paying themselves multiple times within the same block, as long as they have a single matured satoshi. Jorge Tim贸n provided a link to a previous post elaborating on this point.The main problem with the CoreXT fork is the potential for double spending, which occurs when a user spends their coins within an 8 MB block that the Core software does not accept. To address this issue, Bdimych Bdimych suggested implementing a minimum block size. This proposal involved filling the remaining free space in the block with zeroes and compressing them. While this solution may seem viable, it does not effectively tackle the challenges posed by schism hardforks.Jorge Tim贸n argued that a minimum block size would not prevent miners from cheating the system. They could simply pay themselves multiple times within the same block, adhering to the minimum size requirement without risking anything. This flaw undermines the effectiveness of implementing a minimum block size as a preventive measure against double spending.It is worth noting that before putting forth proposals or inquiries, it is advisable to search for previous posts to ensure that the topic has not been previously discussed or addressed. By doing so, one can avoid redundancy and contribute more effectively to the conversation.In summary, the CoreXT fork faces the issue of double spending, whereby coins spent using the XT software are accepted in an 8 MB block but rejected by the Core software. To mitigate this problem, Bdimych Bdimych suggests setting a minimum block size and filling the remaining space with compressed zeroes. However, Jorge Tim贸n argues that a minimum block size does not address the challenges of schism hardforks and can be easily exploited by miners. It is essential to conduct thorough research before participating in discussions to avoid repetition and maximize contributions.</summary>
