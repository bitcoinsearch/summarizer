    <summary>In a bitcoin-dev thread, Eric Lombrozo proposed the addition of a new attribute for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that would indicate their &quot;level&quot;. This new attribute aims to prioritize and reduce contention over disagreements within the Bitcoin development community. Lombrozo suggests that the proposed levels should include consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. He provided an example table on his website to illustrate how this attribute might look in practice.Lombrozo also posted a draft proposal on his website, although it still requires further development in certain subsections. He explicitly welcomes comments and suggestions from the community regarding this proposal. In response to the post, Lombrozo emphasized that there are different degrees of &quot;standard&quot; and just because many people adopt a particular approach does not necessarily mean it is officially endorsed by other developers. To address this, he proposes modifying the current &quot;type&quot; attribute to reflect different levels of &quot;standard&quot;.The email sent by Lombrozo further emphasizes the need for modifying the &quot;type&quot; attribute and introduces the idea of adding a new attribute to BIPs indicating their &quot;level&quot;. The proposed levels include consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. Lombrozo argues that disagreements can be tolerable for most things at levels below 1. He also provides a link to an example table on blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html to demonstrate how this attribute might be implemented. If others in the community agree with this proposal, Lombrozo expresses his intention to start working on a BIP draft.Another author in the bitcoin-dev thread highlights the unnecessary contention within the Bitcoin development community over issues that do not necessarily require universal agreement. To address this, they propose the addition of an extra attribute to BIPs indicating their &quot;level&quot;. The suggested categories for this attribute are consensus (hard/soft fork), peer services, RPC, implementations, and applications. The author provides an example table on blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html to illustrate how this attribute might be structured. They also offer to work on a BIP draft if others support the idea.In summary, Eric Lombrozo proposed the inclusion of a new attribute in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to indicate their &quot;level&quot;. This proposal aims to prioritize and reduce contention over disagreements within the Bitcoin development community. Lombrozo suggests modifying the current &quot;type&quot; attribute to reflect different degrees of &quot;standard&quot;. He provides examples and links to demonstrate the implementation of this proposal and encourages feedback from the community. Another author in the same thread supports the idea of adding an extra attribute to BIPs to address unnecessary contention within the community and offers to work on a BIP draft if there is consensus.</summary>
