    <summary>The block size debate in the Bitcoin community has been ongoing for a long time. Jeff Garzik suggests that using the median as the block size is the most natural and logical option, as it eliminates the incentive to 51% attack. He believes that if something other than the median is used, it should be symmetrical. In response to a question about BIP 100's deployment, Garzik confirms that he is working on a technical draft and implementation, which will hopefully be presented at ScalingBitcoin.org. Currently, only the PDF of BIP 100 is publicly available. The proposal suggests allowing miners to vote on the maximum block size they will accept, with the size increasing if 70% or more of the blocks mined in the previous two weeks have voted for a larger size. When asked about the "most common floor," Garzik mentions that it could be interpreted as the 20th percentile, but there is some argument for taking the mode of several tranches. The initial deployment of BIP 100 will be in the same manner as size votes.</summary>
