    <summary>Nicolas Dorier, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, recently suggested the idea of creating a visualization to display the percentage of votes for different proposals in pie graphs. Specifically, he wanted to compare the support for proposals such as BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, and BIP sipa. His intention was to visually represent the level of support for each proposal based on what is published in blocks.However, one major challenge arises from the fact that there is currently no standardized method for miners to informally vote on the BIPs they support. This lack of a formal voting process makes it difficult to gather the necessary data to create the desired visualization.In response to inquiries about formal voting, Dorier pondered the possibility of incorporating the votes into a pie chart as they become apparent in blocks. He expressed his appreciation for effective visualizations and even shared links to his own protocol concept and Keybase profile.Despite the absence of a defined voting mechanism, the author of the email expressed their willingness to display the pie chart on BIPxDevs if a vote were to exist. However, until a standard way for miners to informally vote on BIPs is established, the creation of the desired visualization remains a challenge.</summary>
