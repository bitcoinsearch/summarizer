    <summary>In a post shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on August 16, 2015, a developer named xor expressed their opinion on the ongoing argument surrounding the block size. They proposed that rather than relying on administrators to constantly adjust a given constant, it would be more effective to delegate this task to a self-adjusting system. The developer highlighted the beauty of systems that do not require human intervention, particularly when designing a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network.The author of the post suggested using a function that calculates the new maximum block size based on previous block sizes or the amount of work contributed by miners. This approach aims to put an end to the ongoing debate and allow for real development to continue. By implementing an averaging function, the new maximum block size can be determined without the need for constant manual adjustments.The post was signed by xor, who is identified as a developer working for the Freenet anonymous P2P network. The author emphasized the importance of systems that operate autonomously, as they are considered more beautiful in the context of designing a decentralized P2P network.</summary>
