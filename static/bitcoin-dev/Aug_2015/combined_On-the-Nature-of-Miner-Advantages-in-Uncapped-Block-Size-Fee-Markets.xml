    <summary>The email thread discusses the effects of transaction validation caches and block compression protocols on the fee market in a scenario of uncapped block sizes. It is noted that large miners have their own network to pre-relay blocks globally, reducing relay times for transactions. The orphan risk for including a transaction can be reduced to a tiny amount by including everything in the mempool of reasonably large miners. However, this system disadvantages small miners and provides incentives for network centralization. Peter R argues that as long as block solution announcements contain information about the transactions included in a block, the fee market will remain healthy. He references the Shannon-Hartley theorem to support this claim. Matt Corallo points out that transaction validation caches and block compression protocols also need to be considered. He mentions that many large miners already have their own network for block relaying and suggests using the bitcoinrelaynetwork.org network for smaller miners. Daniele Pinna submits a paper analyzing how miner advantages scale with network and mempool properties in uncapped block sizes. The paper examines the incentivization of pooling large hashrates due to large block subsidies and increasing marginal profits. It also highlights the barrier to entry into a high-efficiency mining class that contributes to the advantage of large miners. As block subsidies decrease, this class is expected to disappear, resulting in a marginal profit structure that decreases with hashrate.The discussion raises concerns about the centralization of the network and the disadvantages faced by small miners. Transaction validation time is considered negligible, and the optimal block size is suggested to include everything in the mempool of other large miners. Peter R's argument about the healthiness of the fee market is supported by the Shannon-Hartley theorem. Daniele Pinna's submitted paper reignites consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101) and addresses criticisms of Peter R's work. The email thread ends with Daniele expressing his involvement in the block size scaling proposal and his preference for BIP102 as an uncontroversial hardfork option.</summary>
