    <summary>In an email thread dated March 17, 2017, Erik Aronesty discusses the challenges and potential solutions related to implementing protocol improvements and larger block sizes in a blockchain system. The speaker suggests that these changes can be handled through a soft fork, allowing the system to be updated without forcing all users to adopt the new rules immediately. It is also proposed that migration to a new system can be achieved by restricting transactions between old and new versions.The speaker emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the technical implications and potential challenges associated with updating a blockchain system. By taking a thoughtful and strategic approach, it may be possible to successfully implement important improvements and advancements while minimizing disruption to the existing user base.However, the proposal to optimize transaction selection by introducing a second dimension has been criticized for unnecessarily complicating the process for miners. The use of block weight in Segwit already solves this issue, making the proposed solution redundant and potentially problematic. The complications that could arise from introducing additional dimensions are highlighted through the example of the Bin Packing Problem. It is argued that the proposed solution would not make any significant improvements and should be reconsidered.After further discussion, a proposal for a post-segwit hard fork is put forward. This proposal involves partitioning the block into three segments: a 1MB old transaction non-witness segment, a new XMB segwit non-witness segment, and a new XMB witness segment. This approach allows users of older, more expensive validation transactions to continue using them, but with higher fees required for the restricted space. Additionally, new segwit blocks that don't have hashing problems can be included in the new non-witness segment of the block. The main objective of this proposal is to address block size limits, increase efficiency, and maintain the security of the blockchain.</summary>
