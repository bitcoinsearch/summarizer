    <summary>The email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussed several topics related to bandwidth limits, Lightning Network, and network splits. One suggestion was to establish global and per node up/down bandwidth limits and communicate them to peers. This would allow for monitoring of actual bandwidth usage and adjustment of connections to meet desired goals. The idea of using Lightning Network to prepay for bandwidth/data was also proposed, with the possibility of paying different amounts for different types of data. Refunds could be requested for useless/duplicate/invalid/spam data, and connections with nodes that do not refund could be terminated. These measures would incentivize the relay of unconfirmed transactions and new blocks, while improving spam/DDoS resilience.Another suggestion was to relay advertisements of available bandwidth and prices. This would enable nodes to make informed decisions about their connections based on bandwidth availability and costs. To identify network splits, nodes could generate a hash of "nonce + pub key + tip blockhash" that surpasses a difficulty threshold. By broadcasting this information, nodes can prove their existence and connectedness. Monitoring the history of these broadcasts could help identify disruptions in the network. It was questioned why nodes attempting to split would not behave correctly and be banned by other nodes. The potential for centralization was also raised, with a mention of the Tor network's method of selecting nodes based on advertised bandwidth.Throughout the discussion, various links were provided for Zcash wallets, Bitcoin wallets, the torrent dynamic blocklist, checking a 10 million password list, anti-spies and private torrents, dynamic blocklist, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub.</summary>
