    <summary>In an email thread, Gavin Andresen suggests replacing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) on the wiki with links to Github documents. He asks Wladimir or Gregory to update BIP 0001 to include the proper process for creating and editing a BIP, as it currently does not mention the Github repo at all. The conversation revolves around the use of Github versus the wiki for storing BIP documents.Jeff Garzik argues that using Github would be better due to its primary source status and mentions a process for submitting and editing BIPs via email or pull requests on Github. Luke-Jr disagrees, fearing that replacing BIPs on the wiki with links to Github could discourage active editing of drafts. No consensus is reached, but the repository for BIP documents on Github remains active.The discussion resurfaces, prompting a review of the previous conversation before repeating the same questions. A suggestion is made to replace BIPs on the wiki with links to Github documents, with a notice that changes should be proposed on Github or mailed to the BIP editor. Luke-Jr opposes this idea, believing it would hinder active BIP draft editing. He argues against adding additional hurdles for developers already struggling to write BIPs. Jeff Garzik is identified as a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist at BitPay, Inc.On December 5, 2013, Wladimir expresses concern that using Github could hinder the editing process of BIPs. Luke-Jr questions why Github would be considered a hurdle, highlighting its easy collaboration through pull requests and web interfaces. He also notes that creating a Github account is easier than obtaining and activating a wiki account. Wladimir clarifies that his concern mainly relates to already accepted BIPs, which should not be edited without discussion, while drafts can still be submitted to the wiki if desired.In December 2013, Wladimir proposes a new repository at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips for storing BIPs, which is deemed more secure than the wiki. To avoid confusion, it is suggested that BIPs on the wiki be replaced with links to Github documents and notices that any changes should be proposed on Github or mailed to the BIP editor (gmaxwell). Luke-Jr opposes this suggestion, arguing that it would stifle active BIP draft editing and create additional difficulties for some developers. He believes bigger hurdles should not be imposed.As a result, a repository is recently created at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips to store BIP documents securely. The next step is to replace the BIPs on the wiki with links to the Github documents and include a notice that changes should be proposed on Github or mailed to the BIP editor, gmaxwell. This approach aims to prevent confusion among users, and Wladimir encourages agreement on this solution.</summary>
