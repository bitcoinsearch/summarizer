    <summary>A startup called Hawk Financial Group, LLC is seeking one or two experienced C++ programmers who are knowledgeable about Bitcoin internals to join their team. The startup is working on a unique merge-mined altcoin project that aims to provide a valuable service to the entire crypto-coin ecosystem. However, before revealing more details about the project, applicants are required to sign a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement.The startup is particularly interested in candidates who have previous experience in adding features to Bitcoin or related technologies. Those who have made significant contributions in this area will be given preference. Interested individuals can send an email to eduffield82@gmail.com, providing a description of their work experience. The applications will be carefully reviewed, and if deemed suitable, the startup will share their detailed plans with the applicants.In December 2013, Evan Duffield, the founder of Hawk Financial Group, LLC, had originally posted an email to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, seeking skilled C++ programmers for his startup. The goal was to create a merge-mined altcoin that would offer a unique service to the crypto-coin ecosystem. However, this announcement received criticism from Jeremie, a long-time follower of bitcoin-development, who believed that such emails were irrelevant and considered them spam. He expressed concerns that these types of emails would divert true discussions between core-devs elsewhere, making it difficult for people like him to follow them.Meanwhile, Peter Todd, an expert in the field, cautioned against the use of merge mining in altcoins. He argued that without majority or near-majority hashing power, an attacker could easily execute a 51% attack on the altcoin by reusing existing hashing power. Luke, on the other hand, disagreed with Todd's point of view. He stated that any non-scam altcoin would be safe using merged mining because it would be in the attacker's interest to invest in the altcoin rather than attacking it. Luke also mentioned that there are ways to ensure the full security of bitcoin miners even when not all participate in the altcoin.In response to Todd's concerns, he suggested hiring someone competent to analyze the idea and recommended starting a timestamping service as a potential exception to his warning. Todd was willing to discuss the matter informally but was not ready to agree to any non-compete/non-disclosure terms.Additionally, Troy Benjegerdes made a unique offer to the startup by proposing to buy their company using revenue generated by his AGPLv3 copyrighted licensed Minco.me(c) cryptographic currency. He claimed that this currency would revolutionize work by providing a guaranteed income to anyone with a Mincome(C) address, eliminating the need for traditional employment. Benjegerdes advised the startup to seek legal counsel to avoid any potential contamination of their business model with a viral copyright license.</summary>
