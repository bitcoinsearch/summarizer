    <summary>In December 2013, Warren Togami Jr. backported patches from master and Litecoin to create a Bitcoin 0.8 client with additional features. The backported patches were successful on Linux and Win32, but a rare crash was discovered on MacOS X. This crash seemed to be related to a race condition involving SendCoinsEntry::clear(). To address this issue, Wladimir suggested that the setFocus() should be moved from clear() to a separate function called "focusPayTo". After removing both setFocus() calls that occur after clicking Send, another crash occurred within qt. Warren has been actively working on backporting patches from master and Litecoin to enhance the Bitcoin client 0.8 for Linux and Win32. However, a rare crash has recently been identified on MacOS X, specifically involving SendCoinsEntry::clear(). Toffoo and coblee were able to replicate the issue on MacOS X 10.9, while Warren encountered it on 10.6.8. The build was created using Xcode 3.2.6 on MacOS X with MacPorts qt4-mac qt-4.8.4, aiming to simulate Gavin's build environment for the 0.8.x releases. Despite Warren's attempts to build master, he encountered difficulties due to being unfamiliar with the build environment. He plans to try qt-4.8.5 next, although reproducing the crash may prove challenging.</summary>
