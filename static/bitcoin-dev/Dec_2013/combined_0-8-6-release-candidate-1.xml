    <ns0:summary>On December 9, 2013, a conversation took place between Roy Badami and Wladimir regarding the final release of a certain project. Roy mentioned that the release was not announced on a mailing list and asked if there was another list he needed to be on. He also suggested that announcements should be posted on both a mailing list and bitcointalk.org. Wladimir agreed and proposed adding a list of places to announce to the release process.Drak pointed out on the same day that the bitcoin.org website was still pointing downloads to version 0.8.5 of bitcoin. Roy explained that it made sense not to promote release candidates on the website. However, Drak mentioned that version 0.8.6 had been released and was being discussed on bitcointalk/reddit. Roy then asked if there was a mailing list he missed, expressing the importance of having announcements posted on both the mailing list and bitcointalk.org.Another user named Drak shared a link to a post on Bitcointalk.org on December 9th, asking if it was an official announcement. Jeff Garzik confirmed that it was indeed an official announcement. The content of the announcement was not mentioned, but it was noted that once information is publicly available, it cannot be controlled or prevented from being discussed.In another email conversation on December 9th, Wladimir and Drak discussed the issue of premature online file sharing. Drak suggested that no files should be placed online unless they are officially released to avoid confusion. However, Wladimir argued that once the files are uploaded, they become official releases despite any additional builds or announcements. It was also acknowledged that public availability of files cannot be stopped, leading to discussions and posts on platforms like bitcointalk.org.Gregory Maxwell and Drak had a conversation on December 9th about the release of Bitcoin version 0.8.6. Drak claimed that the version was already released and available for download on sourceforge.net, but Maxwell clarified that it had not been officially released yet and was only queued for announcement. Drak expressed concern about the release workflow and suggested that no files should be placed online unless they were the official release.On December 9th, a discussion took place regarding the release of a new project on Bitcointalk and Reddit. However, according to an email from Drak, the project had not actually been released yet as it was waiting for an independent gitian build before an announcement could be made. This contradicted previous claims that the project had already been released and was circulating online.The bitcoin.org website was brought to attention on December 9th for still pointing downloads to version 0.8.5. It was suggested that an update was needed to ensure users had access to the latest version of the software.On December 8, 2013, a minor error was found in version 0.8.6rc1 of Bitcoin, where the leveldb subtree merge was done incorrectly. Despite this, Gavin Andresen noted that it was not a showstopper bug and decided to tag and ship v0.8.6 given the lack of reports of issues from hundreds of downloads.Gavin Andresen sent an email on December 5th, 2013, requesting help in testing the 0.8.6 release candidate 1, which was available for download from SourceForge. Warren had previously found the error in the leveldb subtree merge.In summary, there were discussions about the release process, the bitcoin.org website needing an update, the availability of release candidates, and the need for coordination in announcing releases. The release of a certain project was questioned, with conflicting information about its status.</ns0:summary>
