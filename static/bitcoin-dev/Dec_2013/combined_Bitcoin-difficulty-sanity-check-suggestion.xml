    <summary>Mark Friedenbach disagrees with this proposal, arguing that adjusting the difficulty could introduce security risks. He suggests alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms being explored by some alts, such as the 9-block interval, 144-block window, and Parks-McClellan FIR filter used by Freicoin to recover from a mining bubble. He believes that if such a scenario were to happen to Bitcoin, there would be sophisticated alternatives available and enough time to make the necessary changes.The conversation also touches on the safety of running Bitcoin through a proprietary dial-up network. Matt criticizes Ryan Carboni for not clarifying the attack and posting ideas without a proper understanding of the Bitcoin network. He states that it is frowned upon to suggest ideas without technical substance. The discussion takes place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.Overall, the email conversation revolves around the potential security risks of adjusting Bitcoin's difficulty after a certain period of time. Different developers express their opinions on the matter, discussing alternative difficulty adjustment algorithms and the importance of safeguarding the network against potential attacks.</summary>
