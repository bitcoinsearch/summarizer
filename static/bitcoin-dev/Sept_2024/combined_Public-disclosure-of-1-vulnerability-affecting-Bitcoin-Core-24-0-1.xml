    <summary>Antoine Poinsot has highlighted a pivotal update concerning Bitcoin Core, specifically addressing the misconception that checkpoints are no longer utilized as a defense mechanism against known attacks. This clarification comes in the wake of discussions sparked by the report produced by Darosior, which led to the reevaluation of the role of checkpoints within the Bitcoin Core infrastructure. The referenced GitHub pull request ([link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25725)) serves to correct misunderstandings and confirms that, as of commit ab0b5706b, checkpoints remain a critical component of the system's security measures.

In addition to this, there has been an announcement regarding the exposure of a vulnerability detailed on the official Bitcoin Core website ([link](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/09/18/disclose-headers-oom)). This announcement is part of a broader strategy to embrace a new vulnerability disclosure policy, details of which can be found at [link](https://bitcoincore.org/en/security-advisories/policy). The significance of this development lies in its timing and the commitment to transparency and security it represents for the Bitcoin Core project. Furthermore, there is an anticipation of disclosing additional vulnerabilities next month that affect versions of Bitcoin Core prior to version 25.0, highlighting an ongoing effort to fortify security measures surrounding the software.</summary>
