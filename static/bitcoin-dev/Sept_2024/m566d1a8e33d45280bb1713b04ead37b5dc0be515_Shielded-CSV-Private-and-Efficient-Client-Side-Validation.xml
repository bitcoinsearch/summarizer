    <summary>The primary challenge identified for the protocol involves the aspect of bridging, as highlighted on page 4 of the discussed paper. This challenge is crucial because without effective bridging solutions, the protocol's utilization might be perceived as merely leveraging Bitcoin for data availability purposes. The BitVM technology is mentioned as a potential aid in this regard. However, there is an emphasis on the need for further upgrades to enhance the programmability aspects of the protocol. Specifically, the introduction of a comprehensive SNARK verification opcode is suggested as a pivotal upgrade. Such an enhancement would enable rapid deployment of the protocol on Bitcoin. Moreover, it would significantly contribute to endowing Bitcoin with robust privacy features, addressing a longstanding area of concern within the digital currency's ecosystem.</summary>
