    <summary>The recent update from the Bitcoin Core team highlights a disclosed vulnerability that can be reviewed in full detail at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2024/09/18/disclose-headers-oom). This announcement is part of a broader strategy to implement a new disclosure policy concerning security vulnerabilities within the project. The specifics of this new policy can be found at [Bitcoin Core's security advisories page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/security-advisories/policy). Additionally, there is an indication of further announcements to come, particularly focusing on vulnerabilities identified in versions prior to 25.0 of Bitcoin Core. These updates are scheduled for release next month, signaling an ongoing effort by the Bitcoin Core team to enhance transparency and security through regular communications and updates regarding potential system vulnerabilities.</summary>
