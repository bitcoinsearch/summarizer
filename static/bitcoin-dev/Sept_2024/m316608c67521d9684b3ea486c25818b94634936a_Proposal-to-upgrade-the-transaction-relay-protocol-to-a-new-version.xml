    <summary>Antoine Riard raises a critical point regarding the proposal for discontinuing unannounced transaction messages within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). He emphasizes the necessity of discussing which clients currently utilize these unannounced transaction messages and their objectives in doing so. Furthermore, Riard highlights the potential challenges that could arise in developing wallets with an optimal user experience if the removal of these messages significantly delays transaction broadcasts. The concern revolves around the implementation of wallets and how they might be affected by this proposed change. To provide a well-rounded overview of the implications of this proposal, it's essential to consider how the elimination of unannounced tx messages will impact client operations and user experience, particularly in terms of transaction broadcasting speed. For more detailed insights, Riard suggests visiting [Peter Todd's website](https://petertodd.org).</summary>
