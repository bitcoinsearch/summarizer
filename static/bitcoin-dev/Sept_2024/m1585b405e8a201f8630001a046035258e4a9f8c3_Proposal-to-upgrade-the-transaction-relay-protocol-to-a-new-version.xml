    <summary>Antoine recently initiated a discussion on a significant enhancement to the Bitcoin transaction relay protocol by introducing a proposal for a new node bit service. The proposal has been officially submitted and can be found in a draft form at [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1663), marking a pivotal step towards possibly amending the current mechanisms underlying Bitcoin transactions. This initiative stems from a longstanding consideration of the protocol's evolution, inspired by discussions dating back to 2021, which highlighted the community's desire for improvements in how transactions are propagated across the network. For those interested in understanding the motivations behind this proposal, a comprehensive overview is provided in an archived email thread available at [Linux Foundation's mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018391.html). 

This move by Antoine not only signifies a proactive approach towards enhancing Bitcoin's infrastructure but also invites the community to review, debate, and contribute to the development of this potential upgrade. The proposed changes aim to streamline transaction relays, potentially leading to more efficient and secure transaction handling within the Bitcoin network. Given the technical nature of this proposal, stakeholders and developers are encouraged to engage with the material provided, offering insights, feedback, and recommendations to ensure the proposal's alignment with the broader goals of scalability, security, and efficiency.</summary>
