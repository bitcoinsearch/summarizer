    <summary>Antoine Riard is actively pursuing an initiative to enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem's security and robustness by establishing "free-to-pwn" lightning nodes on the mainnet. This move aims to facilitate sophisticated cross-layer attacks in a controlled environment, such as pinning attacks, to demonstrate their feasibility and impact under real-world conditions. Unlike private regtest or testnet environments, which often do not accurately represent the complex behaviors seen on the mainnet, this approach allows for a more realistic assessment and discussion of potential vulnerabilities within the Bitcoin network. By doing so, Antoine aligns with the research standards of major security conferences that require artifacts for demonstration.

The proposed setup involves running a full node (e.g., core or btcd) alongside a lightning node (like core-lightning, ldk, or lnd), both configured with default mainnet settings. This configuration is crucial for replicating the mempool congestion cycles and other behaviors unique to the mainnet, providing a more suitable environment for testing attack scenarios. Participants are encouraged to fund the opening of new channels to meet the minimum threshold required for conducting meaningful attacks, thereby contributing to the demonstration of these vulnerabilities.

Antoine also addresses potential criticisms regarding the complexity of full-node software and lightning implementations. He suggests that some experts and maintainers might be misleading users about the robustness of the protocol and the safety of their funds, particularly concerning the economic viability of Lightning Service Providers (LSPs). By facilitating public demonstrations of attacks like pinning, he aims to expose these complexities and vulnerabilities, fostering a more transparent and verifiable discussion within the community about the security of the protocol.

Furthermore, Antoine expresses his commitment to showcasing pinning attacks under real-world conditions to emphasize the importance of public verifiability. He critiques certain social media personalities and podcast hosts for potentially undermining end-user safety and trust, despite their claims of open-source veteranship. For those interested in further details, Antoine references a call for demonstrations at a transaction relay workshop in 2021, highlighting the ongoing need for transparent and verifiable testing of the Bitcoin protocol's security measures.
