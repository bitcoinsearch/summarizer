    <summary>Antoine has expressed a commitment to conducting a real-world demonstration of pinning attacks against production lightning nodes, highlighting this as a crucial endeavor that has been largely overlooked by the community. He criticizes the general reluctance to engage in such demonstrations, noting that aside from two lightning protocol developers, most have avoided participating in real-world tests. Antoine's approach includes not interfering with CPU or RAM functionalities but rather focusing on transaction-relay and mempool logic to identify potential vulnerabilities. To encourage participation and accountability, he proposes a unique form of compensation: donating 1 gram of gold or its equivalent in fiat currency or satoshis for every month he is late in demonstrating these attacks, emphasizing the significant energy consumption associated with blockchain operations and the need for practical security evaluations.

Further detailing his plans, Antoine outlines the conditions under which he will conduct these tests on his Lightning node, which is part of the Alice OpenTimestamps calendar. He provides technical details about the node's capacity and operational parameters, ensuring minimal impact on the system's overall functionality due to the redundancy of the OpenTimestamps (OTS) protocol. Despite the critical role of his node within the OTS infrastructure, it receives minimal donations, prompting him to suggest that testers make a net donation to support the community. His perspective extends to the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, advocating for the establishment of "free-to-pwn" lightning nodes to facilitate the demonstration of sophisticated cross-layer attacks under real-world conditions. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between theoretical security assessments and their practical implications, adhering to the standards of major security conferences which demand verifiable artifacts.

Antoine emphasizes the importance of conducting these demonstrations on the mainnet to accurately assess the severity and feasibility of such attacks, critiquing the current reliance on private regtest or testnet environments. He argues that default mainnet settings provide a more realistic basis for testing, as they reflect actual operational challenges and behaviors unseen in simplified test environments. By encouraging open demonstrations of attack techniques, Antoine seeks to expose potential vulnerabilities and complexities within the Bitcoin protocol and its implementations. His call for transparency and public verification is aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of the protocol's security landscape, challenging the community to confront and address these issues collectively.

In summary, Antoine's communication underscores a pressing need for practical security evaluations within the Bitcoin ecosystem, proposing actionable steps to engage the community in meaningful demonstrations of potential vulnerabilities. His emphasis on real-world testing, coupled with a commitment to transparency and community support, reflects a proactive approach to enhancing the protocol's resilience and trustworthiness.</summary>
