    <summary>Antoine promises not to tamper with CPU or RAM functionalities, focusing instead on the intricacies of transaction-relay and mempool logic within the system. He acknowledges the potential for issues by offering to compensate $2400 should the LND node experience significant problems. His interest lies in running a node on the mainnet to exploit channels for rebalancing liquidity in his favor, stating he will provide the necessary liquidity himself.

He also mentions making a $100 donation to an on-chain address provided by the OTS website, showing support for what he considers a valuable tool. Antoine touches upon handling specific scenarios using the latest valid commitment state to avoid the risk associated with justice transactions. This approach indicates a method to mitigate adverse outcomes in transactions without facing penalties.</summary>
