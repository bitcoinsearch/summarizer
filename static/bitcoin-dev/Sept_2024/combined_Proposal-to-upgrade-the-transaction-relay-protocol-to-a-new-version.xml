    <summary>Antoine Riard has proposed a significant update to the Bitcoin transaction relay protocol. This proposal, aimed at introducing a new node service bit, is designed to refine how transactions are broadcast within the Bitcoin network. The draft of this proposal has been submitted and is accessible for review on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1663) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1664). The motivation behind this initiative stems from discussions in the community that highlighted a need for improvements in transaction propagation methods. These discussions, archived in a [Linux Foundation's mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018391.html), provide a backdrop to the current efforts to enhance the Bitcoin infrastructure.
Riard’s proposal does not anticipate immediate changes for non-upgraded wallets as they will continue to process unannounced transaction messages in the same manner with upgraded peers. The proposal also considers the potential future direction where a few inbound slots might always be reserved for non-upgraded peers, following insights from bitcoinj – a foundational library in the Bitcoin ecosystem used for building wallets. This consideration reflects upon the importance of maintaining inclusivity within the network, ensuring that transactions can still be processed seamlessly without mandatory upgrades.
Moreover, there's an ongoing discussion regarding the intricacies involved in transaction message relays, particularly focusing on the reliability of transaction delivery similar to TCP’s guarantees. Splitting the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) into two separate proposals – one for the signaling mechanism and another for the transaction message processing mechanism – is suggested to adhere to the UNIX philosophy about modularity. This division aims to clarify and streamline the upgrade process.
Furthermore, concerns were raised about the potential impact of discontinuing unannounced transaction messages on wallet user experience (UX). Specifically, the delay in transaction broadcasts could complicate the implementation of wallets with optimal UX. Addressing these concerns is crucial for understanding how clients utilizing unannounced transaction messages aim to achieve their goals post-update. This aspect underscores the need for a comprehensive discussion around the implications of the proposed changes on various stakeholders within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
