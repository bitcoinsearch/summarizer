    <summary>Sergio Demian Lerner has proposed a new Bitcoin consensus rule to prevent the covert use of an optimization in the Bitcoin Proof of Work function. This optimization, known as ASICBOOST, allows miners to save up to 30% of their energy costs. The patent for ASICBOOST was applied for by Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner, and it is being offered for licensing by Sunrise Tech Group.There are two ways to take advantage of this optimization: one that is highly detectable and another that interferes with the Bitcoin protocol. The covert mechanism is not easily detected unless it interferes with the protocol. The use of this optimization could result in significant financial gain, depending on the research, investment, and effort put into designing improved cores.However, the potential for covert use and interference with improvements poses a danger to the Bitcoin system. To address this, the proposed rule aims to block the final optimization of ASICBOOST. This optimization involves computing a square root number of candidates on the left and right sides of the hash tree using transaction permutation or substitution. By preventing this final optimization, the benefit of the optimization is substantially eroded.The proposed rule automatically sunsets if it is no longer needed due to the introduction of stronger rules or the acceptance of the version-grinding form. One way to avoid erroneous warning messages when miners use the overt version of ASICBOOST is by reconsidering a rejected BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that was proposed several years ago. This BIP aimed to deter covert use of the optimization but was previously rejected.In summary, the proposal aims to inhibit the covert use of the ASICBOOST optimization in the Bitcoin Proof of Work function. The authors applied for a patent for this optimization, and there are two ways to take advantage of it. However, its use poses a danger to the Bitcoin system. The proposed rule blocks the final optimization of ASICBOOST, and it automatically sunsets if no longer needed. Reconsidering a rejected BIP could help avoid erroneous warning messages when miners use the overt version of the optimization. The document acknowledges Greg Maxwell for the original report that identified errors in the proposal.</summary>
