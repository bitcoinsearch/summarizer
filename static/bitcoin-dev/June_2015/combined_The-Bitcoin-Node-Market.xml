    <summary>The proposal suggests implementing a market-based approach to cover the costs of running nodes on the Bitcoin Network. This approach would involve charging fees for connecting to the network and sharing the financial burden among all users, including those who do not run full nodes.However, there are concerns about the impact this could have on user experience and the potential for centralization. Charging fees for SPV wallets to connect to the network may confuse and frustrate users, potentially leading them to switch to centralized wallet services that do not require such fees. Additionally, the requirement to tie up outputs every time a wallet is opened could hinder users from making timely payments.Despite these concerns, the goal of the proposal is to create a sustainable model for running full nodes on the Bitcoin Network. By sharing the cost among users and developing a market for connectivity fees, the aim is to ensure the long-term viability and profitability of running nodes while maintaining decentralization and a positive user experience.Under the new system, fees will be developed to cover the expenses of maintaining the network. Nodes will collect the necessary funds required to sustain the functionality of the network, aligning the fees with the actual expenses incurred. However, nodes still have the option to offer free access to the Bitcoin network if they choose to do so. This flexibility allows nodes to cater to different user preferences and potentially attract more users by offering a cost-free connection.Overall, the goal of the new system is to ensure the sustainability of the Bitcoin network by distributing the costs of running it among all users. While fees will be implemented, nodes can still choose to provide free access. This approach is expected to lead to market efficiencies, as nodes will only collect the necessary funds to keep the network operational.</summary>
