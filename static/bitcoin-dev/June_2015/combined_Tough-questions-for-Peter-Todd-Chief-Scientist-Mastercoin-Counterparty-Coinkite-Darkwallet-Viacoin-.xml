    <title>Combined summary - Tough questions for Peter Todd, Chief Scientist {Mastercoin | Counterparty | Coinkite | Darkwallet | Viacoin}</title>

    <summary>In a series of email exchanges, several individuals engage in discussions and inquiries related to various topics within the Bitcoin community. One exchange involves Daniel Stadulis, who made an off-topic and inappropriate comment that was criticized by Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer. Garzik's response suggests that Stadulis's original message was not suitable for a technical mailing list. It is worth noting that Garzik includes a signature indicating his role as a BitPay employee and providing a link to the company's website.Another email exchange between Sven Berg and Kr focuses on specific questions regarding the accountability of Peter. Berg seeks information such as the number of hours worked per project out of a 40-hour work week, upfront and ongoing fees for using Peter's name, total amounts allocated for each project, start and end dates of contracts, current and past holdings of altcoins/appcoins, return on investment to investors related to Peter's activities excluding marketing/price pump, involvement in Initial Coin Offers (ICO), and rationale for pursuing ICO fund sources instead of community or established businesses. These questions are posed in relation to the Bitcoin-development mailing list.There is also an email conversation between Braun Brelin and Todd, in which Brelin asks if Todd is a federal prosecutor, state prosecutor, or involved in law enforcement or civil suits against Mr. Todd. Depending on Todd's response, these parties may become involved. Todd's response to these questions is deemed inappropriate, using offensive language.A separate email thread between Mark Friedenbach and Sven Berg discusses Todd's involvement in &quot;shady projects&quot; and his refusal to answer reasonable questions regarding his participation in scams and failures elsewhere. Berg Investigations LLC expresses concern about the lack of transparency when someone prominent is associated with numerous dubious projects resulting in significant losses, such as the failure of DarkWallet. However, Braun Brelin responds to these inquiries by asking if they are federal or state prosecutors, involved in law enforcement, or engaged in civil suits against Mr. Todd before telling them to &quot;F*** off.&quot;In another discussion thread on June 4, 2015, Mark Friedenbach questions the relevance of a topic being discussed in a mailing list. The discussion revolves around accusations against someone named Todd for their involvement in various shady projects and scams, including the failure of DarkWallet. Berg Investigations LLC expresses its belief that the community deserves answers when such prominent individuals are associated with such activities. However, no clear resolution or response is provided regarding this topic.Furthermore, one email conversation within the thread is considered off-topic and inappropriate for the Bitcoin-development mailing list. One individual poses a series of questions related to a project, but another member questions why these inquiries matter to anyone on the list. Additionally, it is observed that all anti-Todd comments originate from *@airmail.cc accounts, although the significance or relevance of this observation remains unclear.Overall, the context provides a list of information that Berg Investigations LLC requires from an individual. This includes details such as the number of hours dedicated to each project per week, upfront and ongoing fees, total amounts allocated for each project, contract start and end dates, current and past holdings of altcoins/appcoins, liquidation dates, return on investment to investors unrelated to marketing/price pump activities, involvement in Initial Coin Offers (ICO), and an explanation for pursuing ICO fund sources instead of community or established businesses. It is also mentioned that this discussion should be taken elsewhere as it is not relevant to the business of those participating in the mailing list.</summary>
