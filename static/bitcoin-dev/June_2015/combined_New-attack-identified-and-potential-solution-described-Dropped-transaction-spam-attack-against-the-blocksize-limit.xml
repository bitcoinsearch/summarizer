    <summary>The blocksize limit in Bitcoin is causing concerns, as it can be exploited by spammers to obstruct transaction confirmation. By filling up blocks with high fees, these attackers could perpetuate the attack indefinitely, particularly if the BTCUSD market weakens due to the network's diminished usability. This self-reinforcing assault poses a threat to Bitcoin until a patch is implemented. The blocksize limit is crucial for maintaining consensus and preventing bandwidth overload. Without it, an attacker flooding the network with transactions could render Bitcoin unusable by ensuring that only 1% of genuine transactions are processed. Meanwhile, individuals would flock to mine blocks and collect fees from the spammers, leading to a significant wealth transfer.In a discussion on the block size limit and spam attacks, Peter Todd argues that a finite block size limit is necessary due to the network's limited bandwidth. While bandwidth varies among users, the block size limit applies universally to safeguard against an attacker overwhelming the network and jeopardizing Bitcoin's value and security. However, Raystonn suggests that removing the block size limit would not harm Bitcoin but instead benefit miners at the expense of spammers, fostering an antifragile system. In response, Todd asserts that even without a block size limit, an attacker could still flood the network until bandwidth usage becomes unsustainable, potentially leading to a failure in consensus. With a block size limit in place, the worst an attacker can do is increase costs without compromising security. However, if fees become exorbitant, legitimate users may abandon Bitcoin due to its impracticality. Ultimately, Todd highlights that technological factors dictate the existence of a block size limit.The Bitcoin Core mempool does not discard transactions with insufficient fees unless they are double-spent or the node restarts. This presents a problem, as the only defense against a spam attack is having enough bitcoins to pay the fees. If there were no block size limit, this attack would merely transfer wealth from spammers to miners, a response that strengthens the Bitcoin network. Although there is currently no cap on the mempool size, hardware limitations prevent unlimited growth. One solution could involve capping the mempool size and prioritizing transactions with higher fees per kilobyte, but this would compromise zeroconf security. Without breaking zeroconf security, attackers can impede the propagation of reasonable fee transactions across the network.</summary>
