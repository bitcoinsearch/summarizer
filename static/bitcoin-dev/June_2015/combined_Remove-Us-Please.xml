    <summary>In October 2014, Gigas Gaming Inc. announced its plans to launch its own cryptocurrency and had hired an expert to do some of the coding for the project by October 14, 2015. They had previously created a cryptocurrency called GigasCorpCoin for testing purposes and had identified an underlying problem with Bitcoin that they aimed to solve. However, the company's President declined to be interviewed about the secretive project due to the amount of work still needed to be done.In June 2015, Gigas Gaming Inc. responded to an email from Jameson Lopp, a member of the Bitcoin-development mailing list, requesting that their email be removed from the list. The company believed that the mailing list had turned into a chatroom and was interfering with official company business. They emphasized the importance of the project and the need for confidentiality. Despite this request, the company continued to develop its cryptocurrency in secret.On June 19, 2015, Gigas Gaming Inc. sent an email requesting to be removed from the Bitcoin-development mailing list, as they believed it had become a chatroom and was interfering with official company business. They included a link to unsubscribe from the list, which is provided at the bottom of every email. This request was made to the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge.From the available information, it can be inferred that Gigas Gaming Inc. was facing issues with the mailing list, potentially due to excessive emails or irrelevant messages that were impacting productivity or communication within the organization. The company took proactive steps to address their concerns by requesting to be removed from the list. However, the exact nature and impact of the issue remain unclear without further information.Overall, the situation highlights Gigas Gaming Inc.'s commitment to maintaining a professional and focused work environment, despite any challenges posed by the mailing list. It remains to be seen how this issue will be resolved and if any changes will be made to the management of the mailing list in the future.</summary>
