    <summary>In 2015, Gregory Maxwell raised concerns about the lack of progress on BIP-drafts related to Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors and Order-based Smart Property Coloring. Fellow Traveler had been waiting for nine months for updates on these proposals but found no discussion or activity regarding them. Maxwell searched through his email and the mailing list archives but could not find any information. Only two proposals were attached to a post on Sourceforge, while the remaining proposals in the Open-Transactions/rfc and Monetas/rfc repositories were never submitted due to the use of alternative identifiers instead of BIP numbers.A member of the community named Fellow Traveler expressed frustration over the lack of progress on BIP-drafts related to Base58 Serialization for Transaction-Based Color Descriptors and Order-based Smart Property Coloring. These proposals can be found at https://github.com/Open-Transactions/rfc/tree/master/bips. Despite waiting for nine months, there has been no discussion or any information available on these proposals. Fellow Traveler conducted a thorough search of their email and the mailing list archives but found no relevant results. They reached out to others for assistance but received no response. In an attempt to resolve the issue, Fellow Traveler is considering creating separate threads for each proposal, assuming that there may have been a mailing list error.</summary>
