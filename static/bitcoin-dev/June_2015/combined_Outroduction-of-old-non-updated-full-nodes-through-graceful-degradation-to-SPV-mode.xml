    <summary>Natanael, in a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, emphasized the importance of phasing out old software versions that lack sandboxing capabilities. These outdated versions can be exploited and used counterproductively, which goes against their intended purpose. In the context of Bitcoin, full nodes are responsible for validating new transactions based on their own set of rules and policies. As the global consensus evolves and agrees upon rule changes, incompatible old full nodes will eventually be removed from the blockchain.However, identifying outdated nodes is currently challenging. To address this issue, Natanael proposed implementing expiration dates for nodes that lag behind due to multiple soft forks. These expired nodes would automatically switch to Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode while simultaneously alerting their owners. This approach allows nodes to continue functioning with minimal disruption, and it also prompts owners who do not regularly update their software to recognize the necessity of an update.In addition to expiration dates, Natanael suggested introducing an explicit declaration of block policy/rules within blocks themselves. This declaration would include miner votes for changes and a clear statement of incompatibility with old versions. By doing so, nodes would be able to alert their owners about the impending need for an update. Switching to SPV mode once again ensures a smooth transition and reduces the urgency associated with hard forks, giving more time for the entire network to upgrade.The decision to switch to SPV mode offers several benefits. Firstly, it extends the lifetime of older nodes without compromising security. Secondly, it prevents abandoned nodes from trusting potentially malicious longer chains. Moreover, this approach informs node owners that they cannot validate blocks using outdated code, prompting them to investigate and update as necessary. While there is still a need for information campaigns to ensure the timely updating of SPV fallback nodes, the absence of rushed deadlines makes this process more manageable.Overall, the suggestions made by Natanael aim to deprecate old software versions that lack sandboxing capabilities. By implementing expiration dates and providing explicit block policy/rules, the Bitcoin network can ensure a smoother transition to new versions, while minimizing disruption for node owners and buying more time for everyone involved.</summary>
