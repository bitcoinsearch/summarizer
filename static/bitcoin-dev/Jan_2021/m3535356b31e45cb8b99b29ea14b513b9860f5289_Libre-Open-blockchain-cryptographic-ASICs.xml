    <summary>The discussion revolves around the quest for a transparent and open development of ASIC/SoC, primarily driven by concerns over the security and transparency of FIPS-approved crypto-chips currently used in hardware wallets to secure vast amounts of cryptocurrency. The origin of this concern dates back to an encounter at the Barcelona RISC-V Workshop in 2018, where it was highlighted that the reliance on closed and secretive chips could be problematic, prompting a move towards more openly developed solutions. This initiative aims not only to ensure the integrity of cryptographic operations but also to allow for full audit trails and formal correctness proofs of the hardware design.

Interest in developing such open hardware has been growing, as evidenced by various initiatives and discussions within the community. For example, at FOSDEM2019, there was talk of creating a basic embedded processor with libre licensing, aimed at cryptographic tasks like digital signing, which would be built using older but still functional semiconductor processes (350nm or 180nm). Furthermore, significant support has come from NLnet through their "Assure" Programme, which awarded grants for projects aligned with these goals, including the development of the LibreSOC Core and efforts towards ensuring formal correctness of low-level hardware description language (HDL) components. Such support underscores a shift in perception, marking a move from skepticism towards the feasibility of open-source developers creating ASICs to a reality where even Foundry PDKs are becoming open source.

The technical possibility of using Open Hardware to develop commercial products is now recognized, illustrated by Richard Herveille's contribution to Bitmain's first Antminer product. However, the emphasis here is on developing fully transparent, openly-developed ASICs capable of cryptographic tasks, with a strong push towards eco-conscious blockchain and cryptocurrency products. This move towards transparency and sustainability is further underscored by concerns over the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, suggesting a broader reflection within the community on the future direction of cryptocurrency technology.

Costs associated with developing ASICs across different semiconductor process nodes have been outlined, ranging from accessible options for hobbyists to more expensive ventures into cutting-edge technology nodes requiring substantial investment. Despite the high costs involved in developing custom ASICs, especially at smaller geometry sizes, the conversation suggests a willingness within the community to explore these avenues, provided there is sufficient interest and financial backing. This dialogue opens up an invitation to the wider community to consider what developments they wish to see in this space and how such ambitious projects might be realistically funded and realized.

In conclusion, the ongoing conversation encapsulates a significant shift towards openness, transparency, and sustainability in the development of cryptographic hardware, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. With initiatives like NLnet's funding programs and projects like LibreSOC, there's a palpable momentum towards creating hardware that not only meets the technical demands of today's cryptocurrency ecosystem but also aligns with broader ethical considerations.</summary>
