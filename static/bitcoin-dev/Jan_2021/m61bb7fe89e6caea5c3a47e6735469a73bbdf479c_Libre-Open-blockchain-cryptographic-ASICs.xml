    <summary>The discussion begins with a recount of conversations and encounters that have significantly shaped the perspective on open-source ASIC/SoC development, emphasizing the inherent risks in relying on closed, secretive crypto-chips for protecting vast sums in cryptocurrency assets. A notable meeting at the Barcelona RISC-V Workshop in 2018 with an individual critical of FIPS-approved algorithms in crypto-chips laid the groundwork for these concerns. This skepticism towards closed systems is further underscored by the deliberate deviation from FIPS and NSA-approved constants in the original Bitcoin protocol, highlighting a broader mistrust in such closed and secretive systems regardless of the manufacturer's intentions.

The narrative progresses to describe various initiatives and programs aimed at fostering open-source hardware development. For instance, at FOSDEM2019, the author was approached by a team interested in developing a libre-licensed "embedded" processor, indicating a growing interest in open-source hardware capable of cryptographic tasks. Additionally, the NLnet's new EU Horizon Grant and the Assure Programme ([NLnet Assure Program](https://nlnet.nl/assure/)), alongside projects like betrusted.io ([Betrusted](https://betrusted.io/)) and funding for LibreSOC's 180nm test chip tape-out ([LibreSOC project](https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199)), illustrate the momentum gaining in the space of transparently-open hardware development. These developments are complemented by efforts to ensure hardware design veracity through Formal Correctness Proofs, as seen in the funding received for low-level HDL verification ([Formal Correctness Proofs funding](https://bugs.libre-soc.org/show_bug.cgi?id=158)).

The feasibility of creating commercially viable products using Open Hardware is acknowledged, evidenced by Richard Herveille's contribution to Bitmain's first Antminer product. However, the distinction is made clear between commercial success and the ethos of open-source development, which prioritizes transparency and public auditability over closed, proprietary processes.

Further elaboration on the financial aspects reveals the steep costs associated with ASIC development across various manufacturing technologies, from the relatively accessible 350nm and 180nm processes to the significantly more expensive sub-20nm geometries. The outlining of costs serves as a reality check on the aspirations to develop custom ASICs, stressing that while lower geometries are becoming more attainable, they still require substantial financial investment or compelling market demand to justify their development.

In concluding, the conversation opens up to the broader community, seeking input on the desirability and feasibility of pursuing such open-source hardware projects within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It acknowledges the challenges in bridging the funding gap to bring these ambitions to fruition but also expresses a preference for involvement in eco-conscious blockchain and cryptocurrency products, linking to crowd-funded eco-conscious hardware projects ([Crowd Supply EOMA68](https://www.crowdsupply.com/eoma68)) as examples of what might be achieved. This dialogue encapsulates a vision for a future where open-source hardware not only contributes to the security and trustworthiness of cryptocurrency infrastructures but also aligns with broader ecological and ethical considerations.</summary>
