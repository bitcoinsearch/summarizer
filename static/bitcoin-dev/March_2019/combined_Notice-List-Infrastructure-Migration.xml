    <summary>Warren Togami Jr. has announced on the bitcoin-dev mailing list that a new archive will be created independently outside of the Linux Foundation. This move aims to ensure that future archives do not have to be moved again, even if there are changes to the underlying list infrastructure. The new archive will include a search function and allow users to perform git clone for a local instance.During the discussion, Peter Todd raised the question of where the git archive would be created and maintained. He suggested that it should be timestamped and PGP signed. Another user requested more communication in advance with relaxed timelines for future migration phases.It was announced that starting this week, Bitcoin-oriented lists such as bitcoin-dev and lightning-dev will begin migrating from https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo to the Linux Foundation's new list infrastructure operated by groups.io. The exact switch-over date is still unknown, but users are advised to unsubscribe prior to migration if they do not wish to be auto-subscribed to the new list management system.While each list is notified that migration is complete, users can continue to use these lists as-is. However, archives are considered important for prior art and historic value. A plan is being developed with the Linux Foundation sysadmins to ensure that the current archive permalinks remain static or redirected to the correct post in the new archive.The new archive will be operated independently outside of the Linux Foundation using an open source tool. This will allow all future archives to remain in place, even if there are changes to the underlying list infrastructure. Users will have access to a search function and the ability to git clone for a local instance. More details will be provided soon.</summary>
