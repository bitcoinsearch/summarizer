    <summary>Alistair Mann and ZmnSCPxj have been discussing a potential Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for &quot;Good Behaviour Bonds&quot;. ZmnSCPxj suggests using Hashed Time-Locked Bonds (HTLB) over Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC) to improve privacy. However, this would require the redundant and HASHOP not to be standardized. The conversation then shifts to whether Bob could immediately fail the HTLB to Alice's benefit, leading Alistair to modify his proof-of-concept code to investigate this change.ZmnSCPxj suggests an early return to Alice without any input from her, and describes the overall flow of messages involved in the process. This involves Alice sending the preimage, HASHOP, and a new address for &quot;early return&quot;, making a transaction to the HTLC pattern. Bob has until the HASHOP timeout to decide whether to claim the money or return it to Alice, and if he hasn't decided by the timeout, Alice can get her money back.ZmnSCPxj also proposes a Funding Transaction Pattern that improves privacy by keeping a script offline. It would use HTLB over HTLC to make it indistinguishable on-chain from other uses of HTLC and add to privacy. The redundant would have to be given by Alice to Bob to hide the use of HTLB over HTLC among other HTLC UTXOs.Alistair Mann welcomes the Funding Transaction Pattern and acknowledges that it would improve the mainnet's use of scripts. He also expresses gratitude to those who provided feedback on his proposal for the BIP, including non-bot visitors to the berewic.com site. He plans to submit a formal write-up for the BIP assuming no major changes.In summary, Alistair Mann received feedback on his proposed BIP for &quot;Good Behaviour Bonds&quot; involving HTLB and HTLC. ZmnSCPxj suggests using HTLB over HTLC to improve privacy and proposes a Funding Transaction Pattern to keep the script offline. The conversation also explores the possibility of Bob immediately failing the HTLB to benefit Alice. Alistair Mann welcomes the suggestions and plans to submit a formal write-up for the BIP based on community feedback.</summary>
