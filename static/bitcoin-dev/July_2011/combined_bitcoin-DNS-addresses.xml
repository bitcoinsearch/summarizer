    <summary>In a forum thread from 2011, Rick Wesson asks if anyone has written an HTTPS address resolver for bitcoind. Another user replies that it has already been written twice. The discussion then shifts to improving DNS lookup for the IRC server and the susceptibility of the clipboard feature to MITM attacks. The suggestion is made to create successful apps and protocols that make tasks like buying coffee easier.The original poster discusses randomly emailing Bitcoin to people but acknowledges that it may not be practical. They propose a standardized protocol where a Bitcoin URI could contain a domain name and the client would challenge the domain to sign a nonce with the key corresponding to the address. This would provide a seamless UI without requiring any action from users.There is a debate about the security implications of using DNSSEC or HTTPS for Bitcoin address communication. Matt Corallo argues that DNS resolution is simpler to implement than checking the HTTPS certificate chain. Rick Wesson states that implementing a full DNS resolver in Bitcoin is necessary for security. The discussion concludes with the suggestion that HTTPS has more advantages over a DNSSEC-based solution without significant drawbacks.The email exchange between Rick Wesson and Matt explores the use of DNSSEC for Bitcoin transactions. Rick suggests using email addresses as labels for Bitcoin addresses to aid memorization. He believes in the security offered by DNSSEC but notes that implementation requires a full recursive nameserver inside Bitcoin. HTTPS mapping is also discussed as offering advantages such as different mappings based on IP address.Another email conversation focuses on the formatting of addresses and the use of email-like addresses for consistency. It is clarified that foo.bar.net is not the same formatting as foo at bar.net.Rick proposes a solution to the issue of remembering Bitcoin addresses by resolving them using SRV lookups and making HTTPS requests. The claim that DNSSEC is becoming illegal in the US is challenged, and the proposal aims to simplify user experience.Rick Wesson believes that using email addresses as identities is easier to remember than Bitcoin addresses. He suggests that incorporating Bitcoin into DNS would make DNSSEC more popular. Matt Corallo argues that using URIs and a simple HTTPS server is a better solution, as DNS is still insecure.Rick joins a list to create a patch for DNS lookups in bitcoin transactions. The proposed code allows individuals to publish wallet addresses in the DNS for sending coins. However, using URIs and an HTTPS server with client support is considered a simpler and more secure option.A new member joins a list with the goal of creating a patch to support DNS lookups for bitcoin transactions. They are also working on an internet draft to describe how to put bitcoin addresses in the DNS. The proposed code for sendtoaddress is included.</summary>
