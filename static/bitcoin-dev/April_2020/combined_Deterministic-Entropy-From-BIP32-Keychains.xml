    <summary>A user has opened a BIP PR at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/910 and created a Python library with test vectors referenced in the BIP text. It is unclear whether or not the &quot;Applications&quot; section of the BIP will be split into a separate document or remain in the current BIP.In an email conversation, Ethan discussed his plan to submit a BIP for the deterministic entropy from BIP32 keychains. He had considered this idea previously and let it sit for others to consider as well. He was also considering splitting the BIP into two parts: one for the entropy derivation and another for the applications section. This approach would be similar to how BIP32 serves as the basis for derivation schemes like BIP39, BIP44, BIP49, etc.Rodolfo Novak contacted Ethan to inquire about the assigned BIP number and if there had been any review of the BIP yet. It is unclear if Ethan provided an answer to these questions in his response.Christopher Allen believes that a cryptographic engineering expert, ideally Pieter Wuille, should review the BIP. He thinks this review will suggest improvements and believes that something in this area should be done. He mentions the offline tool #LetheKit provided by BlockchainCommons/bc-lethe-kit as a potential solution. This tool allows users to input their BIP39 from an offline titanium key or SLIP39 Shamir shards and derive a child key in BIP39 form using the LetheKit. The derived key can be delivered via QR from the air-gapped LetheKit to another device.Adam, a member of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, shared his thoughts on the use-case of having an offline seed manager in a recent email. He believes that such a manager can be backed up once and support multiple wallets, solving a practical and under-addressed problem for many users and businesses. He also noted that using a bip39 mnemonic seed as an interface between an offline seed manager and a hardware or software wallet is convenient and an improvement over using custom derivation paths, given the complexity of custom paths and variable support for them in wallets.Rodolfo Novak, via bitcoin-dev, announced plans to implement the Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains BIP on Coldcard in another email. He asked if there was a planned BIP number and if there had been any review of the BIP yet. The email includes Rodolfo's contact information and GPG signature.</summary>
