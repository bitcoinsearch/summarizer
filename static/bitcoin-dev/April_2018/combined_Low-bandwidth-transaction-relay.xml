    <summary>Bitcoin developer Gleb Naumenko has proposed a new protocol to reduce redundancy in transaction relay and improve the efficiency of the Bitcoin network's mempool synchronization. Currently, around 90% of INV messages sent by public-IP nodes are idle duplicates, consuming significant bandwidth. Naumenko's idea involves having new nodes agree on filters with each of the eight nodes they connect to when joining the network. This would allow nodes to relay only a subset of transactions, significantly reducing redundancy. To maintain robustness and latency while protecting against attacks, Naumenko suggests implementing set reconciliation and rotating filters every N minutes.Naumenko conducted emulation and simulation tests to validate his proposal. He found that the proposed protocol could filter transactions through N=2 links, similar to BIP37 but applied to public-IP nodes. By implementing this protocol, the redundancy issue can be addressed without compromising zero-trust and decentralization guarantees. However, Naumenko acknowledges potential concerns about latency and the need for further experiments before setting filters on inbound peers.On April 2, 2018, Naumenko shared his ideas on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and invited feedback. The proposal received mixed reactions from the community. Some expressed concerns about its impact on privacy and censorship resistance, while others praised it for its potential to improve network performance and scalability. Although the discussion thread on the mailing list is now closed, the links to Naumenko's proposal and the discussion thread remain available for those interested in reviewing the details.Overall, Naumenko's proposal aims to reduce redundancy in transaction relay and improve the efficiency of the Bitcoin network's mempool synchronization. The protocol involves filtering transactions through agreed-upon filters between new nodes and their connecting peers. While there are concerns and considerations to address, such as latency and potential impact on privacy, Naumenko's proposal offers potential solutions to enhance network performance and scalability.</summary>
