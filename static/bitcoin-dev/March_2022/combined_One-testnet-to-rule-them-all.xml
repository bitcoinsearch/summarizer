    <summary>The discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the use of testnet3 and signet for testing purposes in relation to sidechains. Some users argue that pegging worthless coins into a system of also worthless coins is pointless unless it is to test pegging mechanisms. However, others believe that testing pegging is necessary for introducing sidechains. The question arises as to why more than 21 million coins are required for testing if they are not needed for real transactions.Testnet3 is considered good enough to represent the main chain during sidechain testing because it is permissionless and open, allowing anyone to start mining sidechain blocks. The scarcity of coins in testnet3 is seen as a feature rather than a bug, as it allows users to see what can happen with a chain after many halvings. Miners in testnet3 can create, move, and destroy zero satoshis, extending the precision of the coins. This makes mining less cumbersome and eliminates the need to find testnet coins and peg them.A proposal discussed in the conversation involves creating one Taproot address per signet in testnet3, enabling coins to travel between many signets. New signets can be pegged in with a 1:1 ratio, and existing signets can be transformed into signet sidechains. Signet would replace testnet3 as the official signet, and other signets could be pegged into it as well. However, it is noted that signet degrades to a testnet if the key is set to OP_TRUE.The conversation also addresses the difficulty of obtaining testnet coins for testing purposes. It is suggested that moving coins to and from testnet3 via one testnet transaction every three months could allow the same coins to travel between multiple signets. Overall, the focus is on finding the best way to test sidechains using the available resources.In summary, the discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list revolves around the use of testnet3 and signet for testing sidechains. There are differing opinions on the usefulness of pegging worthless coins and the need for more than 21 million coins for testing. Testnet3 is considered suitable for representing the main chain during sidechain testing due to its permissionless and open nature. The scarcity of coins in testnet3 is seen as a feature, allowing for the creation, movement, and destruction of zero satoshis. A proposal suggests creating one Taproot address per signet in testnet3 and enabling coins to travel between signets. There are also discussions about the difficulty of obtaining testnet coins for testing purposes. The focus is on finding the best approach to test sidechains using the available resources.</summary>
