    <summary>The debate surrounding extension blocks and their classification as a soft fork is the central focus of the email thread. Some argue that these blocks hinder older nodes from accurately viewing the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set, forcing them to upgrade and making extension blocks no better than a hard fork. The discussion delves into the specific implementation of Confidential Transactions (CT) within extension blocks, highlighting concerns about the safety of CT and potential future breaches by quantum computing. The suggestion of implementing a globally-verified publicly-visible counter is put forth as a means to prevent inflation in case of such breaches, albeit requiring a hard fork. Additionally, it is noted that while CT transactions increase block capacity, they also result in greater network usage across all fullnodes. The email concludes by emphasizing the need for regular computers to be capable of running full nodes and light wallets to be accessible in developing countries.</summary>
