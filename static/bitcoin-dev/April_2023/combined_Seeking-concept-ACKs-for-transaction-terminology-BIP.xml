    <summary>In an effort to minimize confusion and establish a shared vocabulary for discussions about transactions, Murch has proposed the creation of a shared terminology document. This proposal comes after Murch noticed that conversations often get sidetracked by the use of competing terms for transaction components. To address this issue, Murch has drafted an informational BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that outlines terminology for various components and aspects of transactions.The purpose of the proposal is not to achieve perfect consistency but rather to establish a common vocabulary among participants. Murch acknowledges that there are already contradictory established terms, making it challenging to establish a single set of terms. However, the proposed BIP aims to provide a reference document that can help minimize miscommunication and speed up the process of reaching social consensus on transaction-related issues.Josie, a participant in Bitcoin developer education programs, has also recognized the struggle students face when trying to reconcile different terms used in various resources. To address this issue, Josie suggests having a reference document early in the curriculum to reduce cognitive load and establish a shared terminology. Josie emphasizes the importance of the &quot;synonyms&quot; field, which helps map various resources to a common vocabulary.Murch's draft of the BIP can be found on GitHub, where he has asked for feedback from the community on the proposal's creation. Vincent, one of the participants, expressed his agreement with the proposal, noting that he recently discovered he was using a different term to refer to `scriptPubKey`, which caused confusion.On April 5th, 2023, Murch sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list proposing the creation of an informational BIP that would establish a shared vocabulary for various components and aspects of transactions. Murch highlighted the existence of many competing terms, which can lead to confusion during conversations about transactions. The proposed BIP aims to avoid this confusion by establishing a shared terminology. Murch's draft of the BIP is available on GitHub, and he invites the bitcoin-dev community to review it and provide feedback. Murch acknowledges that some established terms are contradictory, and therefore, the proposal does not aim for perfect consistency. Instead, its primary goal is to establish a shared vocabulary that will facilitate conversations about transactions.Antoine responded to Murch's email, expressing agreement with the proposed BIP. This shows that there is support within the community for establishing a shared vocabulary.Andrew Poelstra, Director of Research at Blockstream, also expressed interest in the proposed BIP, leaving the task of refining the terminology to others. The draft of the proposal can be accessed via the link provided on GitHub.Overall, Murch's proposal for a shared terminology document aims to address the issue of confusion caused by competing terms in discussions about transactions. By establishing a common vocabulary, miscommunication can be minimized, and the process of reaching social consensus on transaction-related matters can be expedited.</summary>
