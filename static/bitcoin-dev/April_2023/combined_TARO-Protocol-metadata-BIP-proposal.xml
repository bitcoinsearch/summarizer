    <summary>Adam Ivansky, the founder of Tiramisu Wallet, has submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) concerning the metadata structure of assets traded on TARO Protocol. Although the existing TARO BIP does not specifically address the format of asset metadata, it is crucial for facilitating the trading of various assets like NFTs, stablecoins, and synthetic assets. Through testing different use cases and observing external users, Ivansky has identified essential fields that should be included in the metadata, including the ticker, asset name, description, image representation, and details about the asset's creator. To ensure consistency and compatibility, Ivansky proposes that the metadata be structured as a JSON stored as a string. This proposed structure also incorporates elements from OpenSea's metadata standards, but differs in that it includes actual image data within the metadata. It is important to note that the metadata for TARO Protocol assets does not need to be excessively compact since this data is not directly written to the blockchain. Currently, the Tiramisu wallet on the testnet already utilizes some of these JSON fields.In order to refine and improve upon his proposal, Ivansky seeks feedback from the mailing list community. By establishing a standardized metadata structure, TARO Protocol can enhance its functionality and provide users with comprehensive information about the assets they are trading. The BIP for TARO can be found on Github, though it does not explicitly outline the metadata format. Therefore, Ivansky's proposal serves as an important step towards ensuring seamless asset trading on the TARO Protocol, driven by a well-defined and universally accepted metadata structure.</summary>
