    <summary>Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, has announced his plans to update the status of BIPs 9, 68, 112, and 113 to Final in one month. Previously, there was confusion surrounding the classification of BIP 9, as it was unclear whether it fell under the Draft/Accepted/Final or Draft/Active classification. However, Dashjr believes that since BIPs 68, 112, and 113 have already been successfully deployed, BIP 9 should now be considered an informational BIP falling under the Draft/Accepted/Final class. In order to proceed with this update, Dashjr requires at least one author from each BIP to sign-off on promoting them to (and beyond) the Accepted stage.The discussion surrounding BIP 9 centers around its classification as just an &quot;Informational&quot; BIP, despite its importance in the consensus logic. Luke Jr. argues that BIP 9 is merely informational in advising how other BIPs should deploy themselves, making it a grey area. Wladimir J. van der Laan raises concerns over such an important deployment mechanism being classified solely as an informational BIP. However, none of the authors have commented on changing the type of BIP 9, even after a month of discussion. Thus, Luke asks if anyone objects to him updating BIP 9 to Final status.Dashjr suggests that BIP 9 should be reclassified as a &quot;Standard BIP&quot; rather than just an informational one, as it is included as part of the BIP 68 standard. He further explains that any modifications to BIP 9 would likely require a new BIP, and soft-forks utilizing the new standard would refer to the new BIP number. Reviewing the criteria for status changes, Dashjr concludes that BIPs 68, 112, 113, and 141 are implementations of BIP 9 and should be considered as part of the Draft/Accepted/Final classification. Additionally, he highlights that BIPs 68, 112, and 113 have already been successfully deployed to the network, satisfying the requirements for both Accepted and Final status. Consequently, Dashjr proposes that all four BIPs (BIPs 9, 68, 112, and 113) should be updated to Final status within one month.To proceed with this update, Dashjr needs at least one author from each BIP to sign-off on promoting them to (and beyond) the Accepted stage. Peter Todd, a developer at Bitcoin, has responded with an ACK in support of the &quot;Final&quot; status. The discussion regarding these updates can be found on the Github BIPs repository. However, it is recommended to continue the discussion via email.In summary, Luke Dashjr plans to update the status of BIPs 9, 68, 112, and 113 to Final within one month. There is a debate surrounding the classification of BIP 9, with Dashjr suggesting it should be considered a &quot;Standard BIP&quot; rather than just informational. He argues that BIP 9 is included as part of the BIP 68 standard and that any modifications would likely require a new BIP. Reviewing the criteria for status changes, Dashjr concludes that BIPs 68, 112, 113, and 141 are implementations of BIP 9 and should be classified under the Draft/Accepted/Final category. To proceed with the updates, Dashjr needs sign-offs from authors of each BIP. The discussion took place on the Github BIPs repository, but further communication is recommended via email.</summary>
