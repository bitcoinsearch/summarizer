    <summary>The resilience of Bitcoin's network in the face of potential internet splits is highlighted by Ethan Heilman, who points out that the minimal bandwidth required for block synchronization combined with significant financial incentives make it unlikely for a long-term network partition to persist. Heilman suggests that various technologies like satellite internet, amateur radio, and Blockstream satellite, among others, can easily mend such splits. He emphasizes that if these solutions fail due to an extraordinary event, then the problems faced would extend far beyond Bitcoin's functionality.

Heilman also addresses concerns regarding transaction handling in the event of a blockchain reorganization (reorg). He assures that transactions from blocks that have been excluded in a reorg can still be included in future blocks, provided there are no conflicts. This process, he notes, typically occurs automatically, ensuring the system's robustness against temporary disruptions. For further insights, Heilman references resources available on [Peter Todd's website](https://petertodd.org).</summary>
