    <summary>Eric raises a question concerning the sufficiency of a deserialization phase check for the coinbase input as a null point in mitigating potential malleability issues in blocks that contain only 64-byte transactions. He queries why this method would not be adequate for implementations aiming to permanently mark invalidity, given the computational infeasibility of bypassing such a check. The inquiry is rooted in concerns about weaknesses in Bitcoin’s Merkle Root Construction, with Eric referencing a document that details these vulnerabilities. The document he refers to can be found at [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf), which provides further insight into the technical aspects and implications of the discussed weakness in Bitcoin's architecture.</summary>
