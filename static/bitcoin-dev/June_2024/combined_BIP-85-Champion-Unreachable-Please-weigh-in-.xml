    <summary>Ethan Kosakovsky, the original author of BIP-85, has not shown any GitHub activity since 2021, raising concerns about his availability and willingness to maintain and update BIP-85. A recent pull request was submitted by a computer scientist to address inaccuracies and inconsistencies found within BIP-85, highlighting the need for potential ownership transfer due to Ethan's unreachability. This action was guided by advice from Mark Erhardt and supported by established protocols under BIP-2, which allows for the transfer of BIP ownership when the original author is no longer available or interested in its maintenance.

The computer scientist volunteering to take over has a strong background with implementations of BIP-85, BIP-32, and BIP-39, showcasing their commitment and expertise in this area. Their work can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/akarve/bipsea](https://github.com/akarve/bipsea). They have also shared insights into the potential of BIP-85 through various posts, indicating a deep understanding and active engagement with the protocol. The situation underscores the importance of having active and responsive contributors in maintaining the integrity and relevance of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).</summary>
