    <summary>In an email conversation, Mike Hearn discussed the implementation of bitcoinj and BitPay taking the lead to promote it. Someone volunteered to add payment protocol support to bitcoinj, and if that doesn't work out, Mike has old code from 2012 that he could update. They hope to release updates for Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit once bitcoinj has support. BitPay wants to be a leader in supporting the protocol, so they plan to coordinate release dates.There are plans to add payment protocol support into the v1 firmware of Trezor, a hardware wallet. It is believed that Multibit will be the first wallet compatible with Trezor and also supporting payment protocol. Supporting HD wallets is seen as the trickiest part, but progress has been made by Gary and Matija. A basic HD wallet implementation can be done if necessary.In another email exchange, Wladimir expressed agreement with implementing payment protocol, autotools, and a Qt5 build. There were reservations about coin control due to its introduction of statefulness into the wallet model, but as long as the issues are resolved, it can be included. Pieter mentioned that coin control can be helpful in understanding the difference between the high-level abstraction of the wallet and the implementation of individual coins.Gavin Andresen sent an email discussing the upcoming release of Bitcoin version 0.9. Payment Protocol support was ready to be added to the release, along with other features like sipa's &quot;headers first&quot; initial block download optimization and coin control. Wladimir agreed with the inclusion of Payment Protocol, autotools, and Qt5 build, but expressed reservations about coin control.Gavin further discussed the final release of Bitcoin 0.9 and listed the issues that needed to be addressed. He plans on spending time on code review and working on code that may not make it into the 0.9 release. One member provided positive feedback on the email.The developers of Trezor confirmed their plan to support payment protocol in their hardware wallet, calling it a &quot;missing piece in absolute security.&quot; They are unsure if it will be included in the initial release or added later through a firmware update.In another email exchange, Pieter, Matt, and the author discussed the success of a new optimization technique called headers first. They also emphasized the importance of shipping payment protocol support in multiple clients simultaneously to make a strong statement. They hope to release updates for Bitcoin Wallet or MultiBit once bitcoinj has support. BitPay expressed interest in being a leader in supporting the protocol.Gavin Andresen announced that they are close to a 0.9 &quot;feature freeze&quot; and listed several items he wants to see included in the final release, including Payment Protocol support, the headers first optimization, and coin control. He plans to spend time on code review and helping with pull requests.Overall, these email exchanges highlight the efforts being made to implement payment protocol support in various Bitcoin clients and hardware wallets. The goal is to ensure maximum impact by coordinating release dates and involving big merchants like BitPay. There are discussions about the challenges and benefits of features like HD wallets, coin control, and optimization techniques. Gavin Andresen is actively involved in the development process, aiming to include important features in the upcoming Bitcoin 0.9 release.</summary>
