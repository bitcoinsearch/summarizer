    <summary>In an email thread from August 2, 2013, Chris Evans proposes the idea of implementing a name server in the Bitcoin client software that would allow users to assign aliases to wallet IDs. This would enable them to use human-readable names instead of long alphanumeric strings to represent their wallet public key address. The concept is aimed at making it easier for individuals to remember and recall their wallet IDs.However, Rick Wesson raises the concern that there would be no support for using DNS as a mapping tool for names to numbers. Despite this limitation, the Namecoin blockchain's id/ and a/ namespace has been utilized by several actors for storing bitmessage IDs and Bitcoin addresses. Namecoin itself is designed to provide secure identity management, domain name registration, and decentralized data storage through blockchain technology. It also functions as a merge-mined sidechain of Bitcoin, allowing miners to simultaneously mine both chains without additional effort.The email exchange includes a link to an article discussing how to put SQL databases under version control. This suggests that steps can be taken to incorporate version control for SQL databases, similar to the standard practice for application code.Luke, another participant in the discussion, points out that addresses are not intended to be remembered but rather used electronically or through QR codes as single-use destinations for transactions. While Chris's idea of assigning aliases to wallet IDs may seem helpful, Luke argues that Bitcoin already has mechanisms like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for person/wallet identity. Additionally, Gavin has been working on a new Payment Protocol that allows users to publish a URI for a website, enabling multiple payments to be made using the same link. Therefore, it appears that Chris's proposed solution has already been addressed by these existing mechanisms.Overall, while the idea of having aliases for wallet IDs may initially appear beneficial, it is ultimately deemed unnecessary given the current mechanisms available for addressing and identity purposes within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
