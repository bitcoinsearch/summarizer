    <summary>Nicolas Dorier has proposed a solution to the block size increase problem in Bitcoin that aims to eliminate controversy and be immediately applicable. The proposal focuses on relieving core developers from acting as central bankers and promoting decentralization. According to Dorier, decisions regarding block size should be based solely on technical and decentralization considerations, rather than economic, political, or ideological principles.The proposed solution involves implementing block voting, where miners vote for the desired block size at the next deadline. The median of these votes would then be implemented as the new block size limit. This approach addresses various objectives, including accommodating increasing demand for larger block sizes, expanding network capacity and storage, and aligning Bitcoin with the desires of miners.However, there are uncertainties surrounding the proposed solution. It remains unknown how it would impact Bitcoin's core stability, and whether a better statistical function could be employed. Despite these uncertainties, Dorier urges core developers to step away from their role as bankers and focus on their expertise.The author emphasizes the need to reject arguments based on economic, political, and ideological principles when determining the future of Bitcoin. Instead, decisions should be made based solely on technical and decentralization considerations. The author also highlights the peculiarity of the TCP backoff game and the importance of avoiding decisions driven by maximizing metrics, favoring technical considerations instead.In conclusion, Dorier proposes a solution to the block size problem in Bitcoin that seeks to achieve consensus without controversy, relieve core developers from the central banker role, and promote decentralization. The proposed solution utilizes block voting to determine the new block size limit. While uncertainties exist regarding its impact on core stability and the possibility of a better statistical function, the author calls for a focus on technical decision-making and avoidance of decisions driven solely by economic or political factors.</summary>
