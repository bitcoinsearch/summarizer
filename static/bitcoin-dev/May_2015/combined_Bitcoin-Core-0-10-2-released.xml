    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 0.10.2 has been released and is now available for download. This update includes minor bug fixes and translation updates. It is only necessary to upgrade if you are unable to start the application on Windows with version 0.10.1. The source code can be found in git under the tag 'v0.10.2' or in bitcoin-0.10.2.tar.gz in the distribution.To downgrade smoothly, users are advised to make a backup of their entire data directory. It is important to note that this release utilizes headers-first synchronization and parallel block download, which means that the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software. One notable change in this release is the fix for a serious problem on Windows with data directories that have non-ASCII characters. There are no other notable changes for other platforms. The change log also includes a fix for boost::get usage with boost 1.58 and an avoidance of crash on start in TestBlockValidity with gen=1. Additionally, an issue with imbuing boost::filesystem::path with locale &quot;C&quot; on Windows has been resolved.The release credits Cory Fields, Gregory Maxwell, Jonas Schnelli, and Wladimir J. van der Laan for their direct contributions. dexX7, Pieter Wuille, and vayvanne are also acknowledged for their additional code review and/or security research.Users are encouraged to report any bugs using the issue tracker at Github.</summary>
