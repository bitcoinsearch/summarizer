    <summary>Justus Ranvier, a member of the Bitcoin community and founder of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project, responded to a question about the ratings of Bitcoin wallets. He explained that they rated as many wallets as possible based on the available manpower and will be recruiting more volunteers for future rounds of ratings. The specific question asked why Bitcoin-Core and Breadwallet for iOS were missing from the ratings.The context also includes an email from Jonas Schnelli, a representative of include7 AG in Switzerland. The email provides contact information for the company and warns against sending sensitive data in unencrypted emails. Instead, a link to a secure form is provided.Eric Lombrozo questioned why mSIGNA was not included in the report by the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project. He stated that mSIGNA has advanced security and privacy features and has been listed on bitcoin.org longer than some of the other wallets reviewed. Justus Ranvier replied to the list, stating that they will add mSIGNA to the report if it meets their standards.In addition, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project has published its first report on Bitcoin wallet privacy features. The full report assesses the privacy of several popular wallets. The organization plans to produce further reports over time, establishing itself as a valuable source of information in the Bitcoin space. They are also seeking feedback from the community about their methodology and criteria for assessing privacy.Overall, the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is actively rating Bitcoin wallets based on available manpower and plans to recruit more volunteers for future rounds. They have published a report on wallet privacy features and will continue to produce more reports. The organization is open to feedback from the community to improve their assessment methods.</summary>
