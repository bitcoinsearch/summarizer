    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Peter D. Gray proposed registering three new MIME media types with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for Bitcoin-related content. The proposed media types are bitcoin/psbt, bitcoin/txn, and bitcoin/uri. However, Andrew Chow expressed doubts about the feasibility of registering these MIME types due to the limited number of accepted top-level types and the requirements for registration in the Standards tree. Chow explained that the best tree for the MIME type would be the Standards tree, but it requires registration either associated with an IETF specification or registered by a recognized standards-related organization. Since Bitcoin does not have a recognized standards organization, Chow suggested ignoring the IANA and declaring useful &quot;mime types&quot; in a new BIP that can be agreed upon within the Bitcoin community. Maxim Orlovsky from LNP/BP Standards Association expressed willingness to write the draft of the proposed BIP. Peter acknowledged Andrew's concerns and suggested writing an independent submission RFC for the proposed MIME types. He provided details on the proposed MIME types, including their descriptions and potential uses. He also indicated that they could be useful beyond web servers, such as in NFC (NDEF records) where shorter length is critical. Peter noted that while some MIME types were proposed in BIP-71, they were unrelated to the proposed ones and were never registered.In conclusion, Peter proposed new MIME types for Bitcoin-related content. While there were concerns about the registration process, a new BIP will be drafted to declare these useful &quot;mime types&quot; and agree upon their usage within the Bitcoin community.</summary>
