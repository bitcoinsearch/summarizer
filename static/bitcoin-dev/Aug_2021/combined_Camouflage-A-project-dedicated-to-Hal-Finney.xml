The project includes an issue and pull request tracking system for privacy-related topics, a blog section for Prayank's opinions on privacy issues, and a 'Hall of Fame' section to acknowledge developers contributing to privacy improvements. He emphasizes that the project will not become a paid newsletter or require sponsors, but welcomes contributions to enhance the website.

They share a link to one of Finney's posts on the subject and mention having emailed about privacy issues on their birthday, which may have been less focused due to alcohol consumption.
