    <summary>Ali, a developer working on his own application using Bitcoin Core's HTTP RPC server, has come across a question regarding the functionality of the InterruptHTTPRPC function in src/httprpc.cpp. He noticed that the function only calls LogPrint() without any further action. This leads Ali to wonder if the function is simply a stub or if it actually supports interrupting the event loop at this time.To get a more detailed response, another user suggests that Ali open an issue on Github. This will allow him to engage with the community and receive further insights into the functionality of the InterruptHTTPRPC function. By opening an issue, Ali can expect to get a more comprehensive answer to his inquiry, providing him with the necessary information for his own application development.Overall, Ali's question about the InterruptHTTPRPC function and its ability to interrupt the event loop in Bitcoin Core's HTTP RPC server highlights the importance of community engagement and seeking clarification when encountering uncertainties in source code. Opening an issue on Github presents an opportunity for Ali to gain valuable insights from the community, ensuring the successful development of his own application.</summary>
