    <summary>The writer of this message is concerned about the limited accessibility of becoming a Bitcoin miner, as it is largely dominated by wealthy individuals. They question whether there is a correlation between wealth and running an honest node, and reject the notion that having "skin in the game" automatically equates to honesty. Despite this concern, the writer acknowledges that the validation of blocks on the Bitcoin network is decentralized.James Lu suggests renaming full nodes to "validator nodes" in order to highlight their role in verifying the validity of blocks. This proposed name change aims to alleviate confusion surrounding the control of the Bitcoin network by mining nodes. By emphasizing the importance of validator nodes, it becomes evident that Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network where anyone can run a validator node, even with a low-end laptop.The suggested renaming of full nodes as "validator nodes" would serve to clarify that Bitcoin is not controlled solely by a select group of wealthy individuals. Instead, the network relies on the collective effort of participants who run validator nodes to ensure the integrity of the system. This change in terminology would make it easier for people to grasp the significance of full nodes in maintaining the overall security and stability of the Bitcoin network.</summary>
