    <summary>The Bitcoin Core has a preference for peers that listen on port 8333, and currently, it does not allow incoming connections from those who do not use this port. To address the issue of ISPs blocking the default port 8333, a pull request was merged in October 2021 that allows for non-default ports to be used for automatic connections. Another pull request in November 2021 made further changes to support non-default ports. Although no major issues were found during the review process, there was some discussion and minor suggestions from a reviewer.The option to change the default port was added in May 2011 by Gavin Andresen after a user raised concerns about the default port 8333 on bitcointalk in July 2010. Additionally, a PowerShell script was written and tested on version 22.0 to ban all peers every 100 seconds using the default port, which worked as expected. The default ports used in Bitcoin Core are 8333 for mainnet, 18333 for testnet, 18444 for regtest, and 38333 for signet.It is unclear whether Satoshi considered the fact that 8333 in leet becomes 'beee' in plaintext when choosing the default port for Bitcoin. However, the inclusion of the bad ports list in PR #23542 remains unclear. For more details and justifications regarding these matters, the relevant pull requests and discussions can be found on GitHub.To conclude, Prayank shared information about automatic outgoing connections to peers at non-default ports, emphasizing that the discussion focuses solely on this matter to avoid confusion. Vasil Dimov signed off with his email ID and included a quote by Winston Churchill on diplomacy.</summary>
