    <summary>The discussion revolves around a protocol named Sabu, which was previously mentioned and is recognized for its ambitious goals in the realm of digital transactions. Sabu has been acknowledged for its promising constructs that aim to enhance Bitcoin's circulation, achieving millions of transactions per second while also improving privacy. However, it is noted that Sabu possesses a critical vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by miners, casting a shadow over its effectiveness and security.

In an attempt to address these concerns and explore possible improvements, there is a suggestion to integrate some of Sabu's techniques with other ideas to formulate a more robust solution. This approach suggests a collaborative effort to merge the best aspects of different protocols to overcome limitations and vulnerabilities. The referenced write-up provides further insights into the matter and can be explored for a deeper understanding at [this link](https://raymo-49157.medium.com/time-to-boost-bitcoin-circulation-million-transactions-per-second-and-privacy-1eef8568d180). The conversation underscores the ongoing search for innovative solutions that can enhance the scalability and privacy of Bitcoin transactions without compromising on security.</summary>
