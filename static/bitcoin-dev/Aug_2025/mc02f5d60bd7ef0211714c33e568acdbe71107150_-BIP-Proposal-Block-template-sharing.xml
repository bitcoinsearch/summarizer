    <title>[BIP Proposal] Block template sharing</title>

    <summary>In an innovative approach to enhance compact block relay efficiency, a detailed write-up has been developed focusing on the concept of sharing block templates among peers. This method is particularly useful when miners and nodes operate under varied mempool policies, aiming to streamline processes and improve overall performance. The comprehensive exploration of this idea is available for review and discussion at [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/sharing-block-templates/1906). 

Following the initial proposal, a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) has been formulated to specify the peer-to-peer messages required for implementing this concept. This draft outlines the technical specifications and the operational framework necessary for adopting shared block templates within the Bitcoin network. Interested parties can access the draft BIP through [this link](https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202508-sendtemplate/bip-ajtowns-sendtemplate.md).

For those who prefer engaging in the review process through GitHub, a Pull Request (PR) has been created to facilitate comments and suggestions directly on the repository. This PR serves as a platform for collaborative refinement of the proposed BIP by gathering insights and feedback from the wider developer community. Contributions to the discussion and the review process are highly encouraged via [the GitHub PR page](https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/pull/7).

This initiative represents a proactive step towards optimizing the Bitcoin network's functionality by leveraging the collective expertise of its development community. By fostering open dialogue and collaborative improvements, it aims to achieve a more efficient and harmonious operation of the blockchain's underlying protocols.</summary>
