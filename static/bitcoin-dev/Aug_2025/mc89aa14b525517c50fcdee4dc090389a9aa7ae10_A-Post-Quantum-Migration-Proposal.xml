    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Saint Wenhao raised concerns about the practicality of a proposed solution to Bitcoin's migration issue in the context of quantum computing. The core of Wenhao's argument is centered around the challenge of enabling currently locked funds to utilize a quantum-safe signature scheme without prior commitment to a dual signature mechanism. This critique essentially points to a fundamental flaw in the suggested approach, as it inadvertently circles back to the original migration dilemma that Bitcoin faces. Wenhao's perspective underscores a critical analysis of the proposed solution's feasibility and its implications for securely transitioning Bitcoin in the face of advancing quantum technologies.</summary>
