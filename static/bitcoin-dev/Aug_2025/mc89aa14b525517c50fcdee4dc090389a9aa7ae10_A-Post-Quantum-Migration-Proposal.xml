    <summary>The discussion revolves around the challenges associated with implementing a quantum-safe signature scheme to address Bitcoin's migration problem, particularly in relation to funds that are currently locked without a commitment to a dual signature scheme. Saint Wenhao expresses skepticism regarding the proposed solution's effectiveness in resolving the core issue of fund migration within the Bitcoin network. The concern highlighted is that without a prior commitment to a dual signing mechanism, transitioning to a quantum-safe protocol would inadvertently recreate the original migration dilemma, rather than offering a straightforward resolution. This dialogue underscores the complexities involved in enhancing Bitcoin's security framework to withstand potential quantum computing threats, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive strategy that accounts for the intricacies of existing locked funds and their compatibility with new cryptographic standards.</summary>
