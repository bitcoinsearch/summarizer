    <summary>The discussion revolves around the complexities of implementing a quantum-safe signature scheme to secure Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats. Saint Wenhao raises concerns about the practical challenges of migrating existing Bitcoin funds to a new, quantum-secure system. Specifically, the issue at hand is how funds that are currently locked within the Bitcoin blockchain can be transitioned or spent using a quantum-safe signature without preemptively committing to a dual signature scheme. This scenario underscores the inherent migration problem faced by Bitcoin: merely introducing a quantum-safe solution does not inherently resolve how already existing, or "locked," funds can leverage this new security mechanism without essentially facing the same migration hurdles all over again. The conversation highlights the need for a seamless transition strategy for Bitcoin to maintain its security and functionality in the advent of quantum computing capabilities.</summary>
