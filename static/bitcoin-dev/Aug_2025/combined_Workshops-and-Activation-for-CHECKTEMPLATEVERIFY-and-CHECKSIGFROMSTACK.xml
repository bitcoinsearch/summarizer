    <summary>The Bitcoin development community has been engaging in discussions and efforts to review and potentially activate new proposals through consensus, focusing on the CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) proposal. A call for more extensive code review of CTV was highlighted, noting that despite a significant number of developers being informed, only a small fraction have actively participated in the review process. This calls attention to the need for greater involvement from the community to ensure a broad and thorough evaluation of changes to the Bitcoin protocol.

The establishment of workshops such as those for CTV and CSFS (Covenants and Stateful Scripts) indicates an organized effort to document and discuss these proposals comprehensively. These workshops, including one scheduled for 28 August 2025, aim to provide a platform for understanding the technical aspects of BIP 119 and creating basic CTV transactions. The use of platforms like libera.chat for hosting these discussions underscores the community's preference for open and accessible forums for debate and learning.

A letter signed by Bitcoin developers on 9 June 2025 sought to encourage more core contributors to involve themselves in the review process. This was part of an appeal to economic nodes to evaluate different soft fork proposals, reflecting a concerted effort to incorporate wider community input into the decision-making process. Despite some disagreements among developers regarding specific aspects of the proposals, such as the restriction of TEMPLATEHASH to taproot, there is a general push towards finding a consensus on the way forward for Bitcoin's evolution.

The mention of BIP 8 as a potentially better option for the next soft fork highlights ongoing debates about the best methods for activating changes within the Bitcoin network. Historical context is provided, noting that the proportion of nodes using knots for Bitcoin has changed over time, indicating shifts in the network's dynamics and usage patterns.

In summary, the Bitcoin development community is actively seeking to engage more contributors in the review and discussion of key proposals like CTV. Through workshops, open forums, and targeted outreach, there is a clear effort to foster a more inclusive and comprehensive consensus-building process. These endeavors reflect a desire to learn from past challenges in consensus changes and move towards a more neutral and effective development path.</summary>
