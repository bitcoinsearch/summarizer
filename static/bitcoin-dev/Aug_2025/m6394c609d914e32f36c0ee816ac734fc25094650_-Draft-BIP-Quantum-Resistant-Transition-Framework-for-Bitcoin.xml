    <summary>The recent proposal submitted to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List has sparked a dialogue concerning its novelty and overall contribution to the field, particularly in light of existing literature. Specifically, this new proposal bears a striking resemblance to the "A Post Quantum Migration Proposal" by Lopp et al., which was previously discussed within the community. The critique hinges on the observation that for a new proposal to be considered meaningful and not merely duplicative, it must address and articulate specific shortcomings of preceding works. In this instance, the expectation is for the proposal to detail how it diverges from or improves upon the foundational ideas laid out by Lopp et al.

Furthermore, the communication underscores the importance of thoroughness in presenting new proposals. It suggests that any new submission should include a dedicated section discussing related work. This section should not only acknowledge existing contributions but also critically evaluate them to justify the necessity of the new proposal. Additionally, the motivation and rationale behind introducing another proposal into the discourse should be clearly explained. These elements are deemed crucial for establishing the significance of the new proposal and ensuring that it adds substantial value rather than reiterating what has already been explored.

For those interested in delving deeper into the discussions surrounding these proposals, references have been made available. The original "A Post Quantum Migration Proposal" by Lopp et al. is accessible through a [GitHub link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1895), and further dialogue on the subject can be found at a provided [mailing list archive link](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CADL_X_fpv-aXBxX+eJ_EVTirkAJGyPRUNqOCYdz5um8zu6ma5Q@mail.gmail.com/). These resources offer valuable insight into the ongoing debate and development efforts within the Bitcoin community, highlighting the critical role of innovation and the meticulous evaluation of new ideas against established research.</summary>
