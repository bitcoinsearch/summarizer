    <summary>Javier Mateos has reviewed Calvin Kim's draft proposals and finds them to be progressing well, with no immediate conceptual feedback to offer at this stage. He mentions that the topic of utreexo, which is central to these proposals, has already been the subject of extensive discussion. Given their alignment with editorial standards, Mateos encourages Kim to proceed with opening pull requests for these proposals when ready. This interaction underlines the collaborative and constructive nature of the review process within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List community.</summary>
