    <summary>Javier Mateos highlights the potential for manufacturers to set themselves apart in the market by enhancing self-custody support on their devices, specifically pointing out the opportunity to gain a competitive edge through compatibility with cryptographic curves like secp256k1. This approach not only positions a company favorably against competitors such as Samsung or Apple but also aligns with the expanding interest in bitcoin and similar technologies. The discussion suggests that if a significant value is seen in these functionalities by the market, companies will be incentivized to pursue their implementation.

Furthermore, the mention of Samsung's efforts with its Blockchain Keystore/SDK illustrates that incorporating mobile Hardware Security Modules (HSM) along with secp256k1 is technically feasible. Although Samsungâ€™s initiative showed model and regional fragmentation and depended heavily on the vendor, it marked a step towards practical development in this area. This example underlines the viability of integrating advanced cryptographic support into consumer devices, encouraging other manufacturers to explore similar pathways.

The email also emphasizes Bitcoin's nature as an open and adaptable system, welcoming contributions from any individual or entity. This inclusiveness fosters a diverse range of developments, from software and specification enhancements to tools, without necessitating immediate consensus changes within the Bitcoin community. These alterations often require extensive time, effort, and bear the risk of complicating the underlying system unnecessarily. Mateos advocates for manufacturers to engage in experimentation and practical application of new technologies to contribute positively to the ecosystem before embarking on the challenging path of altering consensus mechanisms.</summary>
