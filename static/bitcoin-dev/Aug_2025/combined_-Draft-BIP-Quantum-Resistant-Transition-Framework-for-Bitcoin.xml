    <summary>The proposal under discussion delineates a strategic framework aimed at transforming Bitcoin into a quantum-resistant network, addressing the imminent threats posed by advancements in quantum computing. It emphasizes the vulnerability of current Bitcoin encryption methods, notably ECDSA and Schnorr signatures, to quantum decryption techniques such as Shor's algorithm. Highlighting the risks, it notes that a significant portion of Bitcoin's value is susceptible to quantum attacks due to exposed public keys, a situation exacerbated by Google's progress in quantum computing which threatens the integrity of 256-bit ECDSA encryption.

The proposed transition to quantum-resistant cryptography is structured in four comprehensive phases to ensure minimal disruption and maintain backward compatibility throughout the process. This methodical approach includes initiating soft-fork activation for quantum-resistant witness programs, gradually phasing out classical ECDSA outputs, and eventually freezing classical UTXOs to safeguard against quantum theft. The proposal underscores the necessity of this phased migration to provide market stability, encourage adoption through incremental pressure, and uphold the principle of consequence for inaction among users.

Central to the proposal is the endorsement of SPHINCS+-SHAKE256f (SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f) for its superior quantum-resistant capabilities, demonstrating significant security enhancements against both Shor's and Grover's algorithms compared to existing cryptographic standards. The document elaborates on various technical aspects, including signature sizes, the entropy of private keys, and the scheme's resilience to quantum attacks. It also stresses the importance of updates and adaptations across the Bitcoin ecosystem, including hardware wallets, exchanges, miners, and light clients, to collectively fortify the network against quantum vulnerabilities.

For those seeking deeper insights and technical specifications, the proposal directs readers to additional resources and documentation provided by the Bitcoin Foundation and federal standards on SLH-DSA. It calls for active participation and feedback from the broader Bitcoin community to refine and perfect the proposal, with an eye towards securing Bitcoin's future against the emerging quantum threat.</summary>
