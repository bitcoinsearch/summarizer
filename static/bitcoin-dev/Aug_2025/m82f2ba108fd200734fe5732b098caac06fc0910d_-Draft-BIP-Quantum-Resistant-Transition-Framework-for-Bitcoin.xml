    <summary>A recent paper, published on August 19th, 2025, discusses the urgency in revising the deprecation timeline for cryptographic standards in light of advancements in quantum computing. This document specifically addresses the vulnerabilities of ECDLP and ECC, with a particular focus on secp256k1 as utilized in Bitcoin, suggesting an expedited timeline for updating these cryptographic practices. The full paper can be accessed through [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14011).

The paper presents a detailed analysis, projecting the emergence of cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) to occur between 2027 and 2033. This estimation is based on several factors including the availability of reliable magic-state supply at scale, the code distance necessary for sustaining multi-hour computational tasks, and the ability to maintain classical-control latency in stride with rapid error-correction cycles. The variability in this timeframe is influenced by the development pace of these critical factors; a slowdown in any could delay the advent of CRQCs, whereas simultaneous improvements could hasten their arrival.

In terms of technical specifics, the paper contrasts current classical computation benchmarks with the anticipated requirements for executing credible attacks on ECC-256 bit encryption using Shorâ€™s algorithm. It indicates that a mid-10^5 to low-10^6 range of noisy qubits would be required under surface code assumptions. Alternative architectures, such as those employing cat-qubits, may offer different trade-offs by reducing the number of physical qubits needed at the expense of increased architectural complexity. This analysis suggests a plausible first window for the threat posed by quantum computing to current cryptographic standards, emphasizing the importance of preparing quantum-resistant protocols sooner rather than later.

The optimism shown in some quarters regarding the timeline for quantum computing developments, particularly from entities like Google and IonQ, is noted with skepticism. Despite the ambitious projections for the scalability of physical qubits, the paper recommends targeting the year 2030 as a deadline for implementing quantum-resistant cryptographic measures. This cautionary stance aims to mitigate potential future disruptions, acknowledging that even if current quantum computing models prove unfeasible, the effort will still address widespread concerns about the security of cryptographic systems in the face of quantum computing advancements.</summary>
