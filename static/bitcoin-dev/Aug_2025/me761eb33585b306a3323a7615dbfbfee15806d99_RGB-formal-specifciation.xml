    <summary>The recent advancements in the RGB project, which introduces smart contracts with client-side validation to Bitcoin, mark a significant leap towards enhancing programmability and privacy without necessitating any soft fork or leaving an onchain footprint. The transition of RGB into production has been officially announced, signaling a pivotal development for the Bitcoin community interested in such innovations.

Further elaborating on this achievement, the formal specification for the consensus aspect of the RGB protocol is now accessible. This comprehensive documentation is available through several resources: the official [Yellowpaper](https://yellowpaper.rgb.com), an [IACR preprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1400), and the [source code](https://github.com/RGB-WG/yellowpaper) itself. These resources provide in-depth insights and technical details about the RGB protocol, offering valuable information to developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field.

Maxim Orlovsky, maintaining the RGB project under the auspices of LNP/BP Labs, Institute for Distributed and Cognitive Systems &amp; Pandora Prime SA, extends this update. This initiative underscores the collaborative effort and dedication towards fostering innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem, promising new avenues for its functionality and application.</summary>
