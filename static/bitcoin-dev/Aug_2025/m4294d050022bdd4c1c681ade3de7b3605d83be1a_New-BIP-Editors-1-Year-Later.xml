    <title>New BIP Editors: 1 Year Later</title>

    <summary>The analysis of commits to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository over several years reveals a fluctuating trend in activity levels, with notable increases following the addition of new editors. In the early part of 2024, before new editors were introduced, the repository saw a minimal number of merges. However, from April to December 2024, after the inclusion of new editors, there was a significant rise in the number of merges. This pattern underscores the impact of editor contributions on the repositoryâ€™s productivity. In 2025, the distribution of merges among editors shows a concentration of activity by certain individuals, indicating that a small group of editors is shouldering the majority of the workload.

The detailed commit history for 2024 and 2025 highlights the contributions of various editors, with Jon Atack and Murch being particularly active. The report also calls attention to a few merges contributed by other editors, including laolu, Luke Dashjr, Bryan Bishop, and a mention of no contributions from Ruben Somsen during this period. The links provided offer direct access to specific pull requests merged by these contributors, showcasing their individual contributions to the project.

The email suggests a strategy for managing editorial roles within the BIPs repository to maintain efficiency and avoid burnout among volunteers. The proposal includes implementing term limits for editors to ensure fresh perspectives and prevent long-term monopolization of responsibilities. It envisages a rotating system where three or four active editors manage the workload at any given time, with periodic changes to accommodate personal commitments and prevent stagnation. The idea extends to introducing objective criteria for editor turnover, such as setting a three-year term limit and planning the transition of current editors based on their tenure and activity levels.

Moreover, the concept of an "apprenticeship" role is proposed to ease the recruitment of new editors. This role would allow volunteers to engage in early triage and review of BIPs repository pull requests, facilitating quicker responses to authors without imposing the full responsibilities of an editor. This system aims to identify and cultivate potential editors through demonstrated skill and commitment, ensuring a steady influx of qualified individuals to maintain the repository's vitality and responsiveness.</summary>
