    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the conversation turned towards the security implications of quantum computing on ECDSA signatures, particularly focusing on the selection process of the R value in these signatures. It was highlighted that the signer has the autonomy to choose the R value, which opens up a potential vulnerability in the face of quantum attacks. Quantum attackers could exploit this by selecting any arbitrary post-quantum (PQ) signature data and committing it at the time of spending.

Jameson Lopp's insights were brought into the conversation to underline a critical point regarding the verification of transactions in a post-quantum scenario. Specifically, Lopp points out that if the output script does not commit to a post-quantum public key before the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs), then third-party nodes will find it challenging to verify the authenticity of transactions occurring after such technology becomes available. This situation suggests a pressing need for UTXO holders to take proactive measures to migrate or otherwise secure their holdings against potential quantum threats.

The emphasis on migration as a necessary step for securing transactions against quantum attacks indicates a broader concern within the blockchain development community about preparing for future technological shifts. The dialogue serves as a reminder of the ongoing efforts required to maintain the security and integrity of blockchain technologies in the face of rapidly advancing computational capabilities.</summary>
