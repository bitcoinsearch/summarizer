    <title>A Post Quantum Migration Proposal</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the intricacies of how the ECDSA R value, which is selected by the signer, plays a critical role in the security dynamics of Bitcoin transactions in the face of quantum computing threats. The focus is on the potential vulnerabilities that arise when dealing with post-quantum cryptographic (PQ) signatures, especially in the context of Bitcoin's UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model. A key point made by Lopp concerns the necessity for outputs to have committed to a post-quantum public key well before the arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC). This commitment is essential for third-party nodes to verify the authenticity of transactions that occur in a post-CRQC landscape.

The issue at hand is not just about the technological advancement of quantum computers but also about the proactive measures that users of the Bitcoin network must take to ensure their holdings remain secure. Specifically, there is an implied need for a migration strategy for UTXO holders to transition their assets to quantum-resistant protocols. Without such preemptive actions, it becomes nearly impossible for network participants to ascertain whether a spend made after the advent of CRQCs is legitimate or not.

This conversation underscores the broader challenge facing the cryptocurrency ecosystem as it confronts the quantum threat: the balance between maintaining operational continuity and evolving to address future technological shifts. It highlights the proactive steps required from both developers and users to safeguard digital assets against emerging vulnerabilities.</summary>
