    <summary>The discussion revolves around a nuanced approach to Bitcoin's migration problem, specifically addressing the concerns with a forced sunset policy through the introduction of a dual-signature system. This method offers a strategic way to handle the transition period for Bitcoin users without enforcing a hard cut-off date that would render un-migrated funds inaccessible. The dual-signature solution is aimed at mitigating three main issues associated with the current migration dilemma.

Firstly, it eliminates the risk of permanent loss for users who fail to migrate within initial deadlines. By allowing users to provide both their old and new signatures during the transition, there's no absolute deadline after which their assets become irretrievable. Secondly, this approach facilitates a gradual enhancement of security measures. Users can initially continue using their existing ECDSA signatures while being exposed to quantum risks, then move to a dual-signature format that supports both quantum-resistant and backward-compatible operations, and eventually transition completely to quantum-only signatures. Thirdly, the adoption of this new system is driven by market dynamics rather than rigid protocol mandates, giving users the flexibility to migrate based on external pressures like exchange requirements or personal preference.

A potential roadmap for implementing this dual-signature mechanism into Bitcoin might include several phases. The first phase could involve enabling quantum-resistant output types, followed by introducing dual-signature validation for new transactions. Subsequent phases would allow for transactions that enable spending of UTXOs with exposed public keys through additional quantum proofs, and gradually incentivize quantum migration through economic benefits such as fee discounts and priority processing. Importantly, this phased approach ensures that no user faces a sudden cut-off point where their funds become permanently unspendable.

The key philosophical debate underpinning this discussion is not whether migration is necessary, but how to achieve it in a manner that balances network security with user sovereignty. The traditional sunset approach, which enforces migration through protocol changes, contrasts with the dual-signature strategy that offers optional migration paths. This reflects a broader consideration of how Bitcoin can evolve to confront quantum computing threats without compromising its foundational principles of user control over assets.

In conclusion, exploring a hybrid strategy that combines elements of forced sunsetting for genuinely abandoned coins with flexible, dual-signature options for active but unmigrated funds could represent a viable middle ground. Such an approach would maintain network security and user autonomy, respecting the ethos of "not your keys, not your coins" in the context of quantum migration challenges.</summary>
