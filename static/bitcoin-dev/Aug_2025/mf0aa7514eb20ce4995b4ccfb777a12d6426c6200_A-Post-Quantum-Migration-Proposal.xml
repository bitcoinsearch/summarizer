    <summary>The discussion around the dual-signature approach in Bitcoin migration addresses significant concerns regarding the current forced sunset strategy, proposing a more flexible and user-centric solution. This approach is aimed at mitigating the challenges associated with the mandatory transition to quantum-resistant algorithms by introducing a system that allows users more freedom and security throughout the migration process.

The dual-signature mechanism solves several critical issues inherent in the forced migration model. Firstly, it removes the risk of permanent loss for users who fail to migrate their funds within the initial deadlines. By enabling the use of both traditional and quantum-resistant signatures during the transition period, users are afforded the opportunity to move their funds without facing a hard cutoff date. This effectively offers a safety net, ensuring that users are not abruptly locked out of their assets.

Furthermore, this method introduces a gradual upgrade path towards enhanced security, rather than enforcing an immediate, all-or-nothing switch to quantum-resistant mechanisms. Users can choose to continue using ECDSA signatures while acknowledging the risks posed by quantum computing, utilize dual signatures for a blend of backward compatibility and increased security, or fully transition to quantum-only signatures as they see fit. This tiered approach respects user autonomy and recognizes the diverse needs and preferences within the Bitcoin community.

Another advantage of the dual-signature model is its reliance on market-driven forces to encourage migration, as opposed to strict protocol-enforced deadlines. This aspect leverages existing dynamics within the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as exchange requirements and user preferences, to naturally promote the adoption of quantum-resistant measures. It suggests a more organic and less disruptive path towards achieving quantum resilience.

The proposed implementation pathway for integrating this approach into Bitcoin includes several phases, beginning with the enablement of quantum-resistant output types and progressing through the introduction of dual-signature validation, allowance for transition transactions with additional quantum proofs, and the application of economic incentives to encourage quantum migration. Importantly, this strategy eliminates the possibility of funds becoming permanently inaccessible due to missed migration deadlines, addressing a major concern with current models.

In essence, the debate between prioritizing network security through forced migration and upholding user sovereignty through optional migration presents a complex set of trade-offs. However, considering Bitcoin's historical precedence for soft forks and the fundamental principle of "not your keys, not your coins," exploring methods that maintain user optionality—even at the cost of increased implementation complexity—seems warranted. The suggestion of a hybrid model, which combines sunset provisions for definitively abandoned coins with dual-signature support for active but unmigrated funds, represents a thoughtful compromise that seeks to balance security concerns with respect for user autonomy.</summary>
