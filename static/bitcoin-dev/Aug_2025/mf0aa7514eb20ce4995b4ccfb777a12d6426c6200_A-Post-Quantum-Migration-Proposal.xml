    <summary>The discussion revolves around a refined approach to Bitcoin's migration problem, focusing on the dual-signature mechanism as a solution rather than the outright elimination of the issue. The essence of this method lies in addressing the transition period for users and funds with a more flexible and user-oriented perspective.

The dual-signature strategy specifically tackles three main challenges associated with the forced sunset of Bitcoin's current system. Firstly, it eliminates a permanent loss deadline, allowing users who miss initial migration periods to still transfer their funds by providing both the old and new signatures. This introduces a nuanced security upgrade path, where users can gradually increase their security measures from using the existing ECDSA (exposed to quantum risks), to employing both the old and new signatures for a transitional phase, leading up to a point where only the quantum-resistant signatures are necessary. Additionally, this approach leans on market-driven forces rather than forced protocol changes to encourage migration, enabling exchange requirements and user preferences to naturally guide the transition.

For Bitcoin, a practical application of this methodology could unfold in several phases. Initially, the network would introduce quantum-resistant output types, followed by the adoption of dual-signature validation for transactions. Subsequently, a phase would allow transactions that enable spending of previously vulnerable outputs with additional quantum proofs, before finally incentivizing quantum migration through economic benefits like fee discounts and priority processing. Importantly, this phased implementation avoids a scenario where funds become irretrievableâ€”a critical departure from the binary nature of previous proposals.

At its core, the debate contrasts two philosophies: one that enforces migration to ensure network security and another that values user autonomy by making migration optional. Although both paths entail compromises, the dual-signature proposal emphasizes preserving user choice and flexibility, even if it complicates the technical execution. Given Bitcoin's history with soft forks and the ethos of maintaining control over one's assets, the suggestion is to explore a hybrid model. This model would combine the sunset policy for evidently abandoned coins with dual-signature mechanisms for actively used but unmigrated funds, aiming to balance security needs with user sovereignty.</summary>
