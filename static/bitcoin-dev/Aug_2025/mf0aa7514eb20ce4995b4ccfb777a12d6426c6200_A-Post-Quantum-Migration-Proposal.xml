    <summary>The correspondence from Marc delves into the intricate details of managing Bitcoin's migration issues, particularly focusing on a dual-signature strategy that he advocates for mitigating the challenges presented by the impending quantum computing era. At its essence, this approach is designed not to question the necessity of migration but to offer a method for easing the transition period for users.

Marc outlines that the dual-signature system addresses several key concerns associated with a forced migration scenario. First and foremost, it eliminates the risk of users facing a permanent loss of funds should they miss initial migration deadlines. By allowing users to provide both their traditional and quantum-resistant signatures during the transition, access to funds remains uninterrupted. Furthermore, this mechanism introduces a gradual security enhancement pathway. Users can initially continue using the existing ECDSA security, accepting its vulnerability to quantum attacks, then move to a dual-signature scheme that combines quantum resistance with backward compatibility, and eventually fully transition to quantum-only security measures. This phased approach contrasts sharply with an all-or-nothing migration scenario, offering flexibility and reducing the immediate burden on users.

Additionally, Marc emphasizes the advantage of market-driven migration over enforced deadlines. By relying on exchange requirements and user preferences to encourage adoption of quantum-resistant measures, the ecosystem can adapt organically without the need for abrupt protocol changes.

For Bitcoin specifically, Marc proposes a potential implementation roadmap. This includes initially enabling quantum-resistant output types, followed by the introduction of dual-signature validation for new transactions. Subsequent steps would involve allowing transactions that transition exposed-pubkey UTXOs with additional quantum proofs and gradually introducing economic incentives to encourage the shift towards quantum resilience.

Marc raises a pivotal question about balancing network security needs against user sovereignty. He contrasts the forced migration approach, which prioritizes network security but at the cost of potentially alienating users who fail to migrate in time, with the dual-signature method that upholds user choice and control over their assets. Given Bitcoin's ethos of autonomy—embodied in the maxim "not your keys, not your coins"—Marc suggests that preserving user optionality, even at the cost of increased implementation complexity, might be the more prudent path.

In conclusion, Marc proposes considering a hybrid solution that mandates migration for definitively abandoned coins but offers dual-signature support for active yet unmigrated funds, aiming to strike a balance between security imperatives and user agency. This nuanced perspective underscores the trade-offs involved in securing Bitcoin's future against quantum threats while respecting the foundational principles of user control and flexibility.</summary>
