    <summary>In a recent discussion on enhancing Bitcoin's transition to quantum resistance, an innovative approach involving dual signatures was proposed. This method aims to address the challenges associated with migrating from the current cryptographic standards to quantum-resistant ones, without enforcing a hard deadline that would render some users' funds permanently inaccessible.

The essence of the dual-signature strategy is its focus on the transition period itself rather than the necessity of migration. It presents a solution to several key problems identified in the forced sunset scenario. Firstly, it eliminates the issue of a permanent loss deadline, allowing users who miss the initial migration window to move their funds by providing both the conventional and quantum-resistant signatures. Secondly, it introduces a gradual security upgrade path. Users can continue using the existing ECDSA signatures while accepting the risks associated with quantum computing, use both the old and new signatures for enhanced security, or fully transition to quantum-only signatures at their own pace. Lastly, this approach favors market-driven migration over forced, protocol-enforced deadlines, meaning that adoption is influenced by external factors such as exchange policies and user preferences rather than hard cutoffs.

For Bitcoin, implementing such a strategy could involve several phased steps. Initially, the network could enable quantum-resistant output types, followed by the introduction of dual-signature validation for new transactions. Subsequently, a phase could allow for "transition transactions" where outputs with exposed public keys can be spent using additional quantum proofs. The final step would involve increasing economic incentives to encourage users to complete the migration, such as offering fee discounts or priority processing for transactions secured by quantum-resistant methods. Importantly, this plan avoids any phase in which users' funds become irretrievably lost due to a failure to migrate before a deadline.

This conversation raises a fundamental question about how to balance the need for network security with the preservation of user sovereignty. While the traditional sunset approach emphasizes network security by mandating migration within a specific timeframe, the dual-signature method prioritizes giving users the flexibility to migrate on their terms. Considering Bitcoin's history with soft forks and the ethos of user autonomy encapsulated by the principle "not your keys, not your coins," exploring options that maintain user choice—even at the cost of increased complexity—could be beneficial. A suggested hybrid model would apply the sunset rule only to clearly abandoned coins, identifiable by a lack of movement over a decade, while offering dual-signature support for active but unmigrated funds, aiming to strike a balance between security concerns and user agency.</summary>
