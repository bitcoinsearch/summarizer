    <summary>Antoine Riard shared his thoughts on the dynamics of consensus changes within the Bitcoin development community, emphasizing the complexity beyond mere binary choices and the pitfalls of simplistic classifications such as "good" vs "evil." He highlighted the value of a more nuanced discussion that includes technical opinions from a broader range of participants, suggesting that signatories of consensus-related letters should provide detailed explanations of their technical assessments and the trade-offs involved. This approach would allow the wider community to form their own informed opinions.

Riard also mentioned his conditional support for the CheckTemplateVerify (CTV) proposal, as indicated by his conceptual acknowledgment of the BIP119 code branch found at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31989issuecomment-3218427453). He expressed a neutral stance towards the necessity of CTV's implementation, indicating a willingness to support it if there is sufficient demand among developers and stakeholders, despite not being personally excited about it. This reflects a pragmatic approach to consensus changes, prioritizing the collective decision-making process over individual preferences.

Additionally, Riard reminisced about past moments of collaboration and learning within the developer community, such as the Taproot workshop. Despite his inability to attend future IRC meetings, he showed interest in staying updated through transcripts. This demonstrates an ongoing commitment to contribute to and stay engaged with the broader conversation around Bitcoin development, even in the face of disagreements or differing levels of enthusiasm regarding specific proposals.</summary>
