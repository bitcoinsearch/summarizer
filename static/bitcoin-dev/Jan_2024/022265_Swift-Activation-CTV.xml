    <summary>The recent advancements in the application of CTV, or CheckTemplateVerify, are noteworthy. James O’Beirne has made significant contributions by constructing a prototype vault that exclusively utilizes CTV technology. This development demonstrates the practical utility of CTV in creating secure storage solutions for digital assets. Furthering the practical applications of CTV, Jeremy Rubin has also made notable strides with his creation of various prototypes, including vaults, leveraging his Sapio smart contracting language. These efforts collectively highlight the versatility and potential of CTV beyond theoretical discussions, as it is actively being employed to develop tangible and innovative blockchain-based systems. The assertion that CTV lacks use cases or prototypes is evidently contradicted by these developments, underlining the ongoing experimentation and implementation within the field.
