    <summary>The email from Tom highlights the potential application of a specific schema in peer-to-peer communication between Bitcoin nodes, emphasizing its relevance beyond the previously listed use cases such as steganography, satellite, and radio broadcast. The schema in question allows transactions to achieve up to 30% size savings while maintaining complete reversibility, barring an optional compression of the Txid/Vout. This efficiency is particularly significant within the framework of BIP-324, which can be found at the provided GitHub link. The details of the compressed transaction schema are available in a document titled "compressed_transactions.md." The significance of these savings is underscored by the context of BIP-324, implying the practical benefits this approach could have for Bitcoin node communications.</summary>
