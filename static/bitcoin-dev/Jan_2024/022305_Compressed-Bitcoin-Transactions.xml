    <summary>Tom's email to Jonas provides insight into the efficiency of data compression techniques in the context of cryptocurrency transactions. He reveals that significant size reductions are achieved by omitting unnecessary hashes and public keys, which can be restored upon decompression. In contrast, he points out that traditional compression methods like gzip are ineffective for this type of data; rather than reducing the size, gzip actually inflates a legacy transaction from 222 bytes to 267 bytes. This counterintuitive result is due to gzip's poor handling of pseudorandom data such as signatures, public keys, and hashes.

Tom does note that gzip has limited success in compressing certain aspects of the transactions, specifically the 4-byte integers and some repetitive elements within the transaction format. However, these minor gains are overshadowed by the overall expansion of critical components. Furthermore, Tom agrees that any such compression would need to be implemented at the application layer, specifically mentioning a hypothetical Version 2 peer-to-peer (V2-P2P) encrypted traffic system, suggesting an environment where security and efficiency are paramount.</summary>
