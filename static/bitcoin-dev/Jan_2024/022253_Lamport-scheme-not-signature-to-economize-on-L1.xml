    <summary>The email from the sender suggests an openness to discuss a proposed scheme that they believe could be integrated within the existing Bitcoin infrastructure. The sender points out that the most challenging part of this integration would involve convincing miners to accept the pre-image of a hash of a transaction in a subsequent block as valid authentication. They indicate that commitment transactions could be handled similarly to how current smart contracts operate, emphasizing that the size of these commitments is irrelevant because they are not mined under normal circumstances. The only additional data that would need to be mined, according to the sender, are hashes that would range between 16 and 20 bytes in size. The sender concedes that there is a trade-off involved; while this method would require a transaction to take several blocks to validate rather than just one, this is seen as a necessary cost stemming from the No-Free-Lunch Principle. The sender closes by acknowledging that this message was sent using Proton Mail, which is known for its secure email services.</summary>
