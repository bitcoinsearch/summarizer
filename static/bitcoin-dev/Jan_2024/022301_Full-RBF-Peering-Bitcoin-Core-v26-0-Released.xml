    <summary>The recent release of Bitcoin Core v26.0 incorporates significant enhancements, particularly the integration of Antoine Riard's full-RBF (Replace-By-Fee) peering code. This upgrade serves a dual purpose for nodes that operate with full-RBF functionality. Primarily, when the configuration is set to mempoolfullrbf=1, these nodes now broadcast a FULL_RBF service bit, signaling their ability to handle full-RBF transactions. Additionally, nodes configured in this manner will actively seek out and establish connections with four peers that also support the FULL_RBF service. This strategic connectivity aims to create a robust network of nodes that can reliably propagate full-RBF transaction replacements throughout the system.

The implementation of full-RBF is not required across the entire Bitcoin network; rather, it would be beneficial if an increased number of users choose to adopt this feature. To better understand the rationale behind running a node with full-RBF capability and its potential benefits for the network, one can refer to a detailed explanation available on Peter Todd's blog at https://petertodd.org/2023/why-you-should-run-mempoolfullrbf.

Peter Todd has already taken the initiative to operate several nodes with the new v26.0 software, enabling the v2transport=1 setting to further enhance network operations. The source code for this updated version of Bitcoin Core is accessible through GitHub at https://github.com/petertodd/bitcoin/tree/full-rbf-v26.0, enabling interested parties to download, review, and run the latest iteration of the software. For those who wish to contribute to the strengthening of the network by running full-RBF nodes, following the provided instructions and configurations is recommended.</summary>
