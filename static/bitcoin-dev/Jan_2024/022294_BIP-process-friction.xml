    <summary>In an effort to streamline the identification of proposals, a new system for creating shorter identifiers has been proposed. The aim is to facilitate easier referencing within reading materials without sacrificing clarity. The proposed format includes "BIN" as a prefix, followed by a two-digit year and the proposal number; for instance, BIN24-1 would refer to the current version of the first proposal of the year 2024. If there's a need to reference a specific revision, a decimal point would be used, resulting in an identifier like BIN24-1.0 for revision 0.

The reasoning behind this proposed format is multifaceted. Utilizing "BIN" consistently underscores the document set being referred to. Omitting the initial dash and any leading zeroes helps reduce visual clutter while retaining meaning. Truncating the four-digit year to just two digits is seen as effective for at least 75 years, with future adjustments unlikely to cause confusion. A decision against removing the second dash was made to avoid misinterpretation of the numbers when read aloud.

Additionally, using a decimal to separate the proposal and revision numbers is viewed as less cluttered compared to a third dash, while still clearly differentiating between the two. With these changes, most proposal identifiers will only be marginally longer than the current shortened BIP numbers, ensuring readability without significantly increasing length. The community has been invited to share their thoughts on this suggested approach.</summary>
