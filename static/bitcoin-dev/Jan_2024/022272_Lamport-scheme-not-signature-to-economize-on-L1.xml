    <summary>The protocol in question has undergone revisions and enhancements as reflected in the latest documentation, which now features a diagram for better understanding. The documentation is accessible via the provided GitHub link. The protocol's efficiency is highlighted by the minimal additional data required for transaction authentication. A plain transaction (TXi) necessitates only 36 bytes for this purpose. Notably, if an address or address chain is reused, the data needed decreases significantly to 16 bytes. This reduction is attributed to the change address aligning with the pre-image of the Lamport scheme. Access to the white paper containing these details can be found at the specified repository on GitHub under the project named LVBsig.</summary>
