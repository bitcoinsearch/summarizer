    <summary>In a recent discussion, the concept of replacing a sequence of OP_IF .. OP_ENDIF with a Merklized Script tree was proposed. A significant concern raised in this conversation pertains to the computational resources required for creating a Merkle root of a given depth. Specifically, there is apprehension about the practicality of this process when executed on standard consumer hardware, especially given the exponential time complexity associated with generating a Merkle root for a full tree of varying depths. The dialogue invites insights or benchmarks that could shed light on the duration it takes to compute a Merkle root for trees of different depths, positing that the process may become impractical for trees deeper than 20-30 levels. This inquiry underscores the need for efficiency and feasibility assessments in the implementation of Merklized Script trees within programming practices.</summary>
