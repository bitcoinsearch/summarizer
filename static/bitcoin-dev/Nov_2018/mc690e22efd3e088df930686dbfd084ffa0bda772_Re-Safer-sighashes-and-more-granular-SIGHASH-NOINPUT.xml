    <summary>Christian Decker expresses skepticism regarding the notion of committing solely to sequence numbers in transactions. He argues that this strategy only prevents the addition of inputs without prohibiting the replacement of existing inputs with nearly any arbitrary transaction. Decker suggests a more meaningful constraint might involve committing to the values of each input's outpoint, as this would offer a genuine limitation on transaction malleability. He dismisses the viability of committing to transaction IDs (txids) or scriptPubKeys due to various technical challenges and inefficiencies, especially in scenarios involving NOINPUT transactions or eltoo-like constructions aiming for script flexibility.

Decker also critiques the idea of treating NOINPUT as a subset of ANYONECANPAY, proposing instead that the OP_MASK operation could be integrated smoothly within transaction scripting. He illustrates how a script requiring certain values to be masked could implement OP_MASK without worrying about the specifics of byte encoding. This approach, he argues, maintains simplicity and functionality by ensuring OP_MASK applies exclusively to PUSH operations and is followed immediately by those operations, thus preventing errors and preserving script integrity.</summary>
