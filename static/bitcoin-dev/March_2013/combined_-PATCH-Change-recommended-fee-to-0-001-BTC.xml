    <summary>In an email conversation between Rune Kjær Svendsen and Luke-Jr on March 11, 2013, they discussed the possibility of doing string substitution for both the value and unit in Qt documentation. Luke-Jr suggested using a formatted string and another function to format the string, while Rune Kjær Svendsen planned on using the method described on the &quot;Use QString::arg() for Simple Arguments&quot; page. He wanted to put a %1 and %2 in the translation strings to substitute for value and unit, respectively. He also mentioned wanting to define the constant in main.h alongside MIN_TX_FEE and MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE.They further discussed forking on Github and using string substitution for both the value and the unit. Luke-Jr suggested using a formatted string and another function to format the string, which already exists to decide how to display units elsewhere. Rune Kjær Svendsen planned to use the method described on the Qt documentation page under &quot;Use QString::arg() for Simple Arguments&quot;. They also discussed where to define the constant and suggested defining it in main.h alongside MIN_TX_FEE and MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE.In a discussion among developers on March 11, 2013, there was a question about whether a new value should be defined solely for display purposes or if MIN_TX_FEE or MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE should be used in some way. Rune Kjær Svendsen suggested that a new value should be created, but no further information was provided as to why a new value was deemed necessary.A user named Rune K. Svendsen suggested changing the minimum fee recommended in the Main tab of the Options dialog from 0.01 to 0.001 BTC or even lower in a Bitcoin development mailing list. He proposed doing string substitution for both the value and the unit by defining a new value solely for display or using MIN_TX_FEE or MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE in some way. He sought more opinions from other developers before proceeding to write the code. Luke-Jr replied to his suggestion, advising him to use GitHub pull requests or publish a git repository instead of mailing patches. He also suggested two commits for this change and expressed no opinion on whether the recommended fee should be changed or not. Eligius uses a lower minimum fee, but most pools/miners treat anything under 0.01 BTC as if it were no fee at all.Rune K. Svendsen sent an email on March 11, 2013, suggesting changing the minimum fee recommendation for Bitcoin transactions from 0.01 BTC to 0.001 BTC or even lower. The current recommendation amounted to about $0.50 at the time of the email. Svendsen recommended making this change on the Main tab in the Options dialog. Svendsen also suggested that pull requests be used on GitHub instead of mailing patches. He further suggested breaking the changes into two commits. The first commit would involve moving the recommended fee outside the translatable string and formatting it using the user's preferred unit. The second commit would change the recommended fee in one place. Svendsen did not express an opinion on whether the recommended fee should be changed or not. However, he noted that some pools/miners would treat anything under 0.01 BTC as if it were no fee at all, despite Eligius using a lower minimum fee.A request has been made to change the minimum recommended transaction fee on the Main tab in the Options dialog. The current recommendation of 0.01 BTC is approximately $0.50 at today's price, but the request suggests changing it to 0.001 BTC or lower. Changes have been made to the optionsdialog.ui file and the localization files for various languages, including bg.ts, ca_ES.ts, cs.ts, da.ts, de.ts, el_GR.ts, en.ts, es.ts, es_CL.ts, et.ts, eu_ES.ts, fa.ts, fa_IR.ts, fi.ts, fr.ts, fr_CA.ts, gu_IN.ts, he.ts, hi_IN.ts, hr.ts, hu.ts, it.ts, ja.ts, lt.ts, nb.ts, nl.ts, pl.ts, pt_BR.ts, pt_PT.ts, ro_RO.ts, ru.ts, sk.ts, sr.ts, sv.ts, th_TH.ts, tr.ts, uk.ts, zh_CN.ts, and zh_TW.ts.The Bitcoin software provides an optional transaction fee per KB to ensure that transactions are processed quickly. Most transactions are 1 KB in size, and a fee of 0.01 BTC is recommended. However, recent updates suggest a lower fee of 0.001 BTC to be used instead. This information is provided in multiple language translations, including Spanish, Estonian, Basque, Persian, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Hindi, Croatian, and Hungarian. These translations can be found in their respective files within the src/qt/locale/</summary>
