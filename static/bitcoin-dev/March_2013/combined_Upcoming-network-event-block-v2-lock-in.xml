    <summary>In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Luke-Jr on March 23, 2013, they debated the role of Bitcoind in relation to BIP34's implementation. While Luke-Jr argued that Bitcoind was not relevant for producing coinbases, Jeff Garzik pointed out that it played a role in supplying the block version and selecting transactions for miners. Both parties agreed that upgrading Bitcoind alone would prevent the creation of forks.Luke-Jr stated in an email conversation that Bitcoind was not involved in the implementation of the miner end of BIP34. However, Jeff Garzik disagreed, explaining that Bitcoind's 'getblocktemplate' RPC call is used by some miners. He mentioned that several pools, including slush, BTC Guild, and ozcoin, were using Bitcoind 0.7 or later for mining.Jeff Garzik announced that the Bitcoin network would undergo a fork to version 2 due to issues with version 1. He assured users that they should not be impacted and encouraged miners to use a recent Bitcoind version (0.7 or later) to mine. However, some ancient miners would produce newly-invalid blocks that would be ignored.In response to Garzik's announcement, one individual stated that they were not aware of anyone mining using Bitcoind 0.7 or later, except for Deepbit which used an older version. However, other open-source pool servers had already supported v2 blocks for months. It was noted that PoolServerJ and ecoinpool had issues with v2 blocks.It was mentioned that once a supermajority of mining reached block version 2 (95%), blocks with nVersion==1 would be rejected. The Version 2 block specification is available on the Bitcoin wiki page for BIP 0034. Users should not be affected by this change, but older miners may produce newly-invalid blocks that get ignored. Upgrading to a recent Bitcoind version is the recommended solution for miners, and assistance can be sought through #bitcoin-dev or bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net.</summary>
