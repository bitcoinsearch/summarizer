    <summary>Bryan Bishop, a bitcoin developer, has shared a list of links to transcripts from the Scaling Bitcoin workshops held in Hong Kong and Montreal. These workshops covered important topics such as block size proposals, scalability, zero-knowledge proofs, and lightning network. While the transcripts may not be exact due to Bishop's typing while listening, they offer valuable insights into the discussions at the workshops.In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Bryan Bishop mentioned that he had diligently typed most of the words down while listening to some talks. This dedication was recognized by Johnathan Corgan, who operates Corgan Labs, a company specializing in SDR training and development services. The email exchange also includes a link to Corgan Labs' website, providing further resources for those interested in the field.The shared links lead to transcripts of talks that cover a wide range of topics related to scalability and security concerns in Bitcoin. Some of these include discussions on zero-knowledge proofs for scalability, segregated witness, block propagation data, validation costs, relay networks, and sharding the blockchain. These talks provide an opportunity to delve into the latest developments and discussions within the Bitcoin community.Overall, this context offers a valuable collection of resources for individuals seeking to learn about the advancements and ongoing conversations in the world of Bitcoin.</summary>
