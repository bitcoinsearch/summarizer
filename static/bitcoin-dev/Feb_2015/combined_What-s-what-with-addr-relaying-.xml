    <summary>The author is currently working on addr relaying for their C# Bitcoin node, Thashiznets/Lego.NET. They are in the process of wiring up their DB in Azure but are facing difficulties due to conflicting information present in two different specification documents. One of the documents fails to mention that the version message now includes a 4 byte checksum and no time in the net_addrs field. On the other hand, the second document provides this important information and also states that the heartbeat interval is 30 minutes and the disconnect interval is 90 minutes, which seems more sensible to the author. As a result, the author modifies their code based on this information.The author highlights the existence of other variations between these two specification documents and requests input from other developers who may be aware of these differences. They seek guidance on any additional variations they should be mindful of while working on addr relaying for their C# Bitcoin node.For further reference, the author provides links to the Github repository of Thashiznets/Lego.NET, the Developer Reference - Bitcoin on bitcoin.org, and the Satoshi Client Node Discovery - Bitcoin on en.bitcoin.it. These resources can provide more detailed information about the specifications and assist in resolving any discrepancies encountered during development.</summary>
