    <summary>The discussion revolves around finding a simple solution for Bitcoin transactions. One suggestion is the use of a browser extension, but it has limitations such as only working until browsers add native support and being limited to one device or requiring manual syncing. The proposed solution involves extra BIP70 extensions for communication between the wallet and merchant, allowing graceful degradation if the browser or wallet don't support it. Another suggestion involves using BLE to link hardware wallets with new devices, enabling secure auto-fill in situations where an untrusted machine is used.In the Bitcoin-development mailing list discussion, Mike Hearn questions the usefulness of auto-filling shipping addresses through wallets when browsers already have this functionality for credit card information. Natanael proposes a protocol that adds a tag in the HTML form to prompt the Bitcoin wallet about payment details. Additionally, he suggests using BLE to link hardware wallets with new devices for secure auto-fill. However, Hearn questions the need to hold location information in a hardware wallet if it's private enough.In an online discussion, Natanael raises concerns about mixing unrelated topics while discussing displaying shipping information on e-commerce websites. MⒶrtin suggests displaying relevant shipping information before adding items to the cart, similar to eBay. Natanael argues that displaying IP addresses isn't always reliable due to VPN or Tor usage. MⒶrtin suggests a browser extension could perform the task without involving bitcoin wallets. Natanael questions whether users would be willing to read all the displayed options, and MⒶrtin suggests a popup slider to choose the level of information to share. Natanael also suggests the system doesn't have to share raw data and provides links to anonymous credentials options. Finally, Natanael states that everything discussed is possible without involving Bitcoin and advocates following the Unix philosophy.In an email exchange, Mike Hearn discusses the use of BIP70 extensions for auto-filling shipping addresses. He suggests using HTML5 data standards instead of wallets to allow merchants to advertise shipping locations in a machine-readable format. The protocol used doesn't matter as long as it simplifies implementation. Hearn proposes adding a tag to the HTML form to prompt the Bitcoin wallet about payment details. One potential solution involves asking a hardware wallet over BLE for data, enabling secure auto-fill while minimizing trust in the browsing device.The discussion focuses on the feasibility of displaying shipping information on websites before any action is taken. IP addresses are deemed unreliable due to VPN or Tor usage. The suggestion is to prompt users with a popup slider to choose the level of information to share. Raw data doesn't need to be shared, and anonymous credentials can be used. Prompting could be delayed until the first item is added to the cart.The author discusses potential extensions to BIP70 for auto-filling shipping addresses. They question whether the wallet is the best place for this feature and suggest reusing existing data from web browsers that already have this functionality for credit card forms. A Star-Trek-like negotiation agent is proposed to standardize metadata and find the best deals. However, the author believes this project may not be suitable for BIP70 due to its current deployment and usage. Instead, they recommend exploring HTML5 data standards for merchants to advertise shipping locations.The discussion revolves around BIP70, a payment protocol for Bitcoin transactions, specifically regarding auto-filling shipping addresses. BIP70 facilitates communication between a user's wallet client and a merchant's server to agree on payment details and other terms. It ensures strong seller identity and supports non-repudiation in face-to-face or non-web scenarios. It allows the wallet/browser extension to inform users immediately if a webshop is acceptable, saving time. BIP70 is not just about payments but also about communicating the terms of the sale.A user questions the need for Bitcoin when websites like eBay display shipping information before transactions. They argue that Bitcoin is unnecessary, and a website or browser extension can handle the task without it. However, BIP70 is more than just payment; it facilitates communication of the terms of sale. For example, it allows users to know if a webshop ships to their country before filling their cart. BIP70 simplifies the shopping experience and addresses various requirements.In a discussion about Amazon's payment process, BIP70 is introduced. It involves communicating the terms of the sale between the buyer and seller before payment begins, including shipping information. By using BIP70, a wallet or browser extension can inform the buyer immediately if they can shop at a particular webshop, saving time. BIP70 improves the transaction process by providing essential information to buyers before they start filling their cart.BIP70 enables communication between a user's wallet client and a merchant's server to agree on payment details and other functionalities. However, it is currently initiated only during payment, which can lead to users not knowing certain information until after filling their cart. The implementation of BIP70 HTML tags on webshops could trigger a user's wallet</summary>
