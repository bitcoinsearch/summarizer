    <summary>On February 1, 2015, a user named xor raised concerns about the release of version 0.9.4 of Bitcoin.org's binaries. They questioned the lack of a release candidate before the official release and whether it posed any danger. In response, it was explained that the changes had undergone testing by multiple individuals as part of git master. Version 0.9.4 was released specifically to address an issue that had not affected previous versions of the binaries. It was clarified that this release was a narrow bug fix backport aimed at ensuring the software continued to work for those who compiled it themselves and received system updates. Therefore, the message conveyed was that there was no cause for concern regarding the release of version 0.9.4.In a communication on Sunday, February 1st, 2015, Wladimir discussed the details of a git tag called v0.9.4. This tag was created as a workaround for a change in OpenSSL that had caused problems. However, the releases were statically built against OpenSSL, meaning there was no need to upgrade if using releases from bitcoin.org. Consequently, there were no changes made on the site. The v0.9.4 tag could be utilized by individuals building from source or distribution packages like the Ubuntu PPA, which unwisely dynamically linked OpenSSL. When asked about the presence of a release candidate before the tag, Wladimir responded that there had been no release for 0.9.4, including neither a release candidate nor anything else. He emphasized that testing and other efforts should be focused on the 0.10 release candidates.The context includes two questions: why there was no release candidate prior to the release, and whether this decision was safe. The absence of a release candidate is viewed as risky by the person asking the question. However, it remains unclear what exactly was released without a candidate version beforehand, and the decision-maker behind releasing without a candidate version is not mentioned. Additionally, an attachment in the form of a signature is included in the context, but there is no information provided regarding its relevance or connection to the rest of the text.</summary>
