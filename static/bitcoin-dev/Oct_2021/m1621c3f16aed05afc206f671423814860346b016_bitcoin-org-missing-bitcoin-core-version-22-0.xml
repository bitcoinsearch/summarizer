    <summary>In the recent correspondence among programming professionals, there has been a clarification regarding the Bitcoin Core 22.0 release. The discussion highlights that Wladimir's attestations for the 22.0 release can be found at the provided GitHub link ([GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs/tree/main/22.0/laanwj)). This serves as a pivotal point in understanding the trust basis for the release without the need for a separate special release key.

Furthermore, it is addressed that the official website for the Bitcoin Core project remains unchanged at [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org), negating any rumors or misconceptions about a new website being launched for this purpose. The question regarding the non-listing of the 22.0 release on https://bitcoin.org is acknowledged but left unresolved, indicating that the responsibility for updates lies with the administrators of that particular site. This series of exchanges underlines the importance of directly referring to official sources and documentation for accurate and reliable information concerning software releases and updates.</summary>
