    <summary>Humberto Marcolino, owner of the repository https://github.com/bitcoin-education/bitcoin-java, has developed an open-source Bitcoin library written in Java. The library includes support for taproot single key transactions and was built with educational purposes in mind. It aims to provide a leaner alternative to bitcoinj, which is considered too feature-heavy. The library does not include features for communication with nodes or any online capabilities, making it ideal for developers looking to build a wallet in Java.Humberto welcomes feedback, pull requests (PRs), and issues from the community. To facilitate collaboration, he has created a discord server for the project. Additionally, he plans to share more examples using the library on the project's website, https://www.bitcoineducation.site/.Mohamed Youssef, a member of the bitcoin-dev community, expressed interest in the library and asked if there were plans for a slack or IRC for collaboration. In response, Steve, a member of the Bitcoin Dev Kit project, suggested that Humberto take a look at their project on GitHub, which is focused on building support for Kotlin/Java and eventually Swift and iOS. Steve also mentioned that joining their team could be a great opportunity for learning about the primitives for on-chain Bitcoin.Overall, Humberto's new open-source Bitcoin library offers developers a lightweight solution for building wallets in Java, with support for taproot single key transactions. The library's focus on education and exclusion of communication and online features make it a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and work with Bitcoin in Java. Feedback and collaboration are encouraged, and interested individuals can visit the project's website for more information and examples.</summary>
