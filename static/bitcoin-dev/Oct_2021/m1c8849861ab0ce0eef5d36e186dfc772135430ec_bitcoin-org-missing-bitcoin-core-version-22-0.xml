    <summary>The process for verifying GPG signatures in Bitcoin Core has seen significant changes starting from version 22. These adjustments involve a new approach where the sha256 checksums are now provided in a distinct file named "SHA256SUMS," separate from the "SHA256SUMS.asc" file which contains the GPG signatures themselves. This modification is pivotal for users aiming to authenticate the integrity and origin of their Bitcoin Core software downloads.

Furthermore, the structure of the signature file itself has been updated to include multiple signatures. This development reflects a move towards a more decentralized verification process, with various "builders" generating these signatures. Notably, each builder contributes their public keys, though it's important to note that not every builder will sign each release. This system introduces a layer of redundancy and trust, rooted in the diverse group of contributors involved in the Bitcoin Core project.

For individuals seeking to navigate these changes, detailed guidance is available on the [Bitcoin Core download page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/) under the "Linux verification instructions" section. Additionally, comprehensive instructions regarding the acquisition and importation of the complete list of builder public keys are accessible through the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.

It's worth mentioning that Wladimir, a key figure in previous release verifications, is no longer signing the releases as of version 22.0. Despite this transition, the list of builders includes many long-standing contributors to the Bitcoin Core project, alongside Wladimir's public keys. While some concerns have been raised regarding the trustworthiness of the new signees within certain GPG networks, it's crucial to approach these changes without spreading undue fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). The aim is to maintain a secure and trustworthy verification process for all users within the evolving landscape of Bitcoin Core development.</summary>
