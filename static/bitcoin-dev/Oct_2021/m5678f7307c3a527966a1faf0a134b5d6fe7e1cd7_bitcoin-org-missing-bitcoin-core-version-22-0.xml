    <summary>In a recent communication, it was highlighted that the official website for Bitcoin Core has long been established as bitcoincore.org. This status is supported by the authentication of the site's content through signatures from not only the personal key of Owen Gunden but also the keys of several other developers involved in the project. This method of validation underscores the importance and reliability of the information presented on this platform.

Furthermore, it was noted that there has been a significant shift in how Bitcoin Core releases are distributed. Specifically, the release maintainer has ceased posting binaries to bitcoin.org for several major releases now. The current availability of these binaries on bitcoin.org is solely due to the efforts of the site's maintainer, who mirrors the releases. This change in distribution practice points towards a strategic decision possibly aimed at centralizing the dissemination of binaries and ensuring users access the most secure and verified versions directly from the official source.</summary>
