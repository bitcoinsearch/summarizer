    <summary>The recent update to version 22.0 has prompted significant changes in the release process of the software, notably regarding the individuals responsible for signing off on new releases. Previously, Wladimir played a key role in this capacity, but he has since ceased to fulfill this function. This shift coincides with other notable changes, including updates to the website. Such concurrent modifications have elicited concerns, particularly due to the critical nature of security within this context. The alteration in signatories, especially against the backdrop of an updated digital presence, raises questions about the integrity and reliability of the verification process, given the absence of established trust with the new signees within the contributor's personal GPG network. This situation highlights the importance of transparency and trust in the maintenance and distribution of software, especially when it pertains to security-critical applications.</summary>
