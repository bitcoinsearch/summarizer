    <summary>The current statechain protocol involves the sender signing the statechain with their public key, which is then verified by the receiver. The receiver also verifies that the sender's public key aggregated with the current server public key corresponds to the public key of the coin. This prevents a 'rogue key' attack by the sender and ensures that the coin cannot be spent without the server's cooperation.</summary>
