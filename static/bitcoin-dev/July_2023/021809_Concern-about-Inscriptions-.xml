    <summary>The largest spam attack in the context is caused by inscriptions, which can embed themselves in the witness with a fee reduction. Unlike other methods like using the op_return field, inscription spamming is prevented due to associated fees and the standardization rule limiting op_return to 80 bytes. However, not taking action against inscriptions could be seen as accepting their practice, leading to more spam attacks in the future. The proposal suggests adding a standardization option without implementing a soft fork, allowing the community to decide whether to activate it or not.</summary>
