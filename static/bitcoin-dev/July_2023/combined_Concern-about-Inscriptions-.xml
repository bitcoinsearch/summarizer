    <summary>Dear Bitcoin developers,I am writing to express my concern about a significant bug that seems to have been overlooked in recent versions of the software. This bug pertains to the "inscriptions" developed by @rodarmor, which have rapidly grown to a size of 11.8GB on the blockchain within a few months. This is causing issues with the UTXO set, resulting in a daily growth of approximately 25MB.While there may be ongoing discussions regarding the nature of these inscriptions, I personally view them as spam due to their recurring nature and their negative impact on the size of the UTXO set and the blockchain. I am curious why this problem has not been addressed more seriously.It should be noted that Bitcoin Core offers options to choose the mempool policy, such as datacarrier or permitbaremultisig. However, when it comes to inscriptions, there are currently no available options except for a patch created by Luke Dashjr. Unfortunately, this patch is impractical for most users as it requires compiling Bitcoin Core.Considering this, I believe it would be beneficial to have options to reject inscriptions in the mempool of a node. Such a feature would allow users to customize their approach in managing these cases and help mitigate the negative impact of inscriptions on the network.In addition to the technical concerns, I also find ethical questions arising from this situation. Inscriptions are primarily used to sell NFTs or Tokens, concepts that have consistently been rejected by the Bitcoin community.Therefore, I kindly request you, as Bitcoin developers, to seriously consider implementing a feature that would enable users to reject inscriptions in the mempool. This measure would contribute to protecting the integrity of the network.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Léo.</summary>
