    <summary>Bitcoin-compatible client software can be customized by users, but there is no guarantee that others will adopt or shut down their versions. Miners often use custom software for mining blocks and pools, and there are multiple clients compatible with consensus other than the Bitcoin Core. To ensure backward compatibility, the Bitcoin community generally implements changes through soft-forks. Even "evil soft-forks" are considered preferable to hard-forks.On September 12th, 2021, James Lu proposed a change via bitcoin-dev that would automatically shut down a full node if MTP-11 (Median Time Past) exceeds five years from the release date of the current software version. The aim of this proposed code is to provide a grace period of around five years for the community to upgrade to a new version capable of executing a new hard fork while maintaining consensus, as long as the change implemented is non-controversial.The implementation of this code would enforce the shutdown of a full node if the MTP-11 timeframe surpasses five years since the software release. By doing so, it ensures that all nodes within the network are running on the latest version of the software, promoting uniformity and consensus among participants. This measure aims to facilitate smooth transitions and upgrades in the Bitcoin network, ultimately enhancing its overall efficiency and functionality.</summary>
