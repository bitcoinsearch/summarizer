    <summary>The author of this message proposes an idea for a hardwallet that offers a solution to make funds unseizable using proof of creation through a key file. The concept revolves around the creator being the only person who can reveal the private keys, thus ensuring the security of the funds. The author explains that the basic idea is to combine the private key on the device with a private key generated from the key file, creating a simple 2-of-2 setup. To generate the Bitcoin address, the software would generate a private key from the key file provided by the user and tweak the device pubkey accordingly. In order to spend from the address, both the key file and the device need to be combined. The author mentions that the device can be configured with random entropy separately from the key file, reducing the risk of malware accessing both the entropy and the key file. It's worth noting that the author does not recommend or mention the use of brainwallets, even for keyfiles. The author emphasizes the importance of security and provides a link to a Github directory where further details about the project can be found. Although the author admits not being a developer, they believe that all the necessary elements to execute the project already exist. The message also includes a PGP signature for added security, and no HTML attachment was included.</summary>
