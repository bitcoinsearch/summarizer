    <summary>Yesterday, a Taproot activation meeting was held on the ##taproot-activation Freenode channel. The agenda for the meeting was posted in advance on the mailing list by BitcoinMechanic. The conversation log from the meeting is available on gnusha.org. During the meeting, participants discussed an alternative release to Bitcoin Core with Speedy Trial as the activation mechanism, followed by BIP 8. However, there were concerns raised about having "Bitcoin Core" in the name of the alternative release, as it could confuse users and make them think it was approved by Bitcoin Core maintainers.The draft release notes for this alternative release can be found on Google Docs, and the GitHub repository is available on BitcoinActivation's GitHub page. In comparison, Bitcoin Core is considering Core PR #21377 for merge, which proposes using Speedy Trial as the activation mechanism with a mix of block height and MTP. A BIP PR has also been opened for the Core release, suggesting finalized parameters. However, if these plans continue, Bitcoin Core and the alternative release may not be entirely compatible due to differences in startheight and timeout definitions.While both Bitcoin Core and the alternative release should activate at the same block height in most cases, there are potential edge cases where one activates and the other doesn't. The use of MTP in Speedy Trial for Bitcoin Core has been extensively discussed, and opinions from reviewers are summarized in a GitHub comment. It is worth noting that anyone can host a meeting on the ##taproot-activation channel by contacting Michael Folkson to book a time slot and posting an agenda in advance on the mailing list. The meeting host has the authority to issue warnings and, if necessary, remove disruptive participants who divert from the agenda.On February 2nd, an open meeting was held on IRC to discuss Taproot activation. This meeting was previously announced on a Linux Foundation mailing list. The conversation log from the meeting is available online for those who are interested. Rusty Russell provided his takeaways from the meeting, which included unanimous support for BIP 8 and overwhelming consensus that a one-year timeout is appropriate. While there was majority consensus for lockinontimeout false, some individuals, such as Luke Dashjr, opposed it. No decision was made regarding the start time.Following the meeting, two BIP 8 PRs were merged in response to an observation by Jonas Nick that without them, nodes could end up on the wrong chain. Bitcoin Core PR #19573 still requires further review before it can be considered for merging. A follow-up meeting will be organized in the format of John Newbery’s Bitcoin Core PR review club.In other news, Chun Wang, co-founder of F2Pool with approximately 16% of global hash rate, announced support for BIP 8 (false, 1 year) according to an update on taprootactivation.com by Alejandro De La Torre.</summary>
