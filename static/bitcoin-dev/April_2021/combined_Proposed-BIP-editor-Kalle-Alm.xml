    <summary>Amir Taaki, a former Bitcoin developer, has criticized the Bitcoin Core team for its lack of vision and long-term roadmap. He proposes that Bitcoin Core be dissolved as the official Bitcoin project and calls for a period of self-reflection to address the problems within the team. In response, some members of the Bitcoin community suggest forming a stewardship committee made up of frequent contributors to oversee the appointment of editors for the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).There is controversy surrounding the addition of Kalle Alm as an editor to the BIP process. Greg Maxwell opposes this addition, stating that it will not resolve the situation regarding PR1104, which has already been merged. The discussion regarding this issue takes place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.The proposal to form a stewardship committee receives opposition, indicating that finding a resolution to the ongoing controversies within the Bitcoin community will not be easy. It is suggested that facilitation, mediation, and organization help is needed in the core development team, with the possibility of hiring experts in these areas. However, compromising on quality is cautioned against.The addition of Kalle Alm as a BIP editor is met with mixed opinions. Some express their approval, noting that it is positive to have someone else interested in the BIP maintainer role. Others raise concerns about the impact on the situation involving Luke-jr's behavior and PR1104, suggesting that automation may be necessary but with some reservations.There are discussions regarding the BIP maintainership role and whether it should be given to a bot or a human. Despite recent drama, having a single editor is deemed less than ideal due to the large number of open pull requests. The proposal to add Kalle Alm as a BIP editor follows the suggestion to use BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which allows proposals to achieve rough consensus on the mailing list before becoming active. Prior precedent exists for BIP editors appointing new editors.Greg Maxwell expresses opposition to the addition of Kalle Alm, believing it will not resolve the situation regarding PR1104. However, PR1104 has since been merged, prompting a query about Maxwell's continued opposition. Further details are not provided in the context.Antoine Riard voices his disagreement with admins of the Bitcoin GitHub organization intervening in the extension of BIP editorship membership. He suggests waiting for a solution that satisfies everyone and recommends that the BIP editorship be moved to its own repository in the future. Luke Dashjr's proposal to add Kalle Alm as a BIP editor follows the suggestion to use BIP 2's Process BIP progression, which requires rough consensus on the mailing list and no unaddressed objections before becoming active.There is a difference of opinion regarding the addition of Kalle Alm as a BIP editor. Some support the proposal, acknowledging Alm's contributions and qualifications, while others may have objections. The discussions take place on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and no objections are raised at the time of the given context.</summary>
