    <summary>Robert Spigler expressed his interest in the use of Bitcoin/LN by Storj/Sia instead of an alt. In response to this, Christopher Gilliard, a member of the Bitcoin community, has created two additional Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) that are related to the BIP he sent out last week. The first BIP, named &quot;storage,&quot; can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/cgilliard/bips/blob/storage/bip-XXXX.mediawiki. This BIP focuses on storage and its implications within the Bitcoin network.The second BIP, named &quot;notarization,&quot; is also available on GitHub at https://github.com/cgilliard/bips/blob/notarization-l2/bip-XXXX.mediawiki. This BIP explores the concept of notarization and its potential applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Chris is seeking feedback and comments on both of these new BIPs.By creating these additional BIPs, Chris aims to further contribute to the ongoing development and enhancement of the Bitcoin network. He is inviting the Bitcoin community to review and provide input on the proposed ideas and solutions put forth in the BIPs. This collaborative effort will help refine the proposals and potentially lead to their implementation in future updates or forks of the Bitcoin protocol.As Robert Spigler expressed interest in the use of Bitcoin/LN by Storj/Sia, it is likely that these new BIPs may offer insights or solutions that align with his interests. The links provided allow interested individuals to access the BIPs directly on GitHub and engage in discussions or share their thoughts on the proposed concepts.Overall, Christopher Gilliard's creation of these additional BIPs demonstrates his dedication to contributing to the Bitcoin community's growth and progress. By seeking feedback and comments, he encourages active participation from other members of the community, fostering collaboration and innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
