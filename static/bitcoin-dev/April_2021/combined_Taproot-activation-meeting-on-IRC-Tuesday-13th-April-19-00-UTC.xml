    <summary>BitcoinMechanic has announced an upcoming Taproot activation meeting on Tuesday, April 13th at 19:00 UTC. The purpose of the meeting is to ratify the Taproot activation plan that was previously discussed in a meeting held on March 16th. This plan, also known as 2021-03 Plan Y, will be the main focus of the upcoming meeting.While there was no consensus reached on the LOT parameter, there appears to be agreement on other parameters, such as BIP8. Additionally, there is sufficient support for LOT=True to proceed with activation safely. Miners will have a period of 18 months to signal and accelerate the activation process. If they fail to do so, Taproot will activate regardless.The activation plan aims to ensure the eventual lock-in of Taproot with the least possibility of a chain split. This is important as the majority of the economy is running on Taproot. The channel for ongoing discussion related to Taproot activation remains open 24/7, allowing participants to engage in discussions even outside of the scheduled meeting time. To facilitate communication, a web chat client is available for use.Michael Folkson, a key figure in the Bitcoin community, has expressed his intention to attend the Taproot activation meeting. He encourages other reviewers to carefully review Core PR #21377. In the event that this pull request is merged into Core, Folkson recommends any alternative release to be fully compatible with the activation parameters outlined in Core.The meeting organized by Bitcoin Mechanic will also cover discussions on an alternative release to Core with Taproot activation code. It will involve deciding when Core should no longer be considered in the process. Detailed contact information for Michael Folkson is provided for further inquiries or correspondence.Interested parties can find the meeting details sent via email by Bitcoin Mechanic, using ProtonMail Secure Email. A summary of the previous meeting is also available through the provided link, offering additional context for those interested in the Taproot activation discussions.</summary>
