    <summary>During the second fortnightly taproot activation meeting, Bitcoin developers discussed various topics related to the technology. One of the main points of discussion was the modifications to Median Time Past (MTP) and Height for Taproot activation. Most attendees agreed that both options were acceptable, but a coin flip was conducted to break the stalemate, with MTP winning.Contributors who agreed to abide by the coin flip outcome will now focus on moving MTP forward. Additionally, Andrew Chow and AJ are working together to find a solution to the contention between them regarding MTP-based ST. This collaboration is expected to lead to a compromise that Bitcoin's community will support.Luke-jr expressed his disagreement with anything related to MTP during the meeting. However, it was acknowledged that both MTP and Heights have their benefits and are technically viable for Taproot. The coin flip decision was seen as a way to prioritize the bigger picture over individual preferences.While there were mixed feelings about using a coin flip for a technical decision, many participants recognized the importance of reaching rough consensus and having running code. The changes agreed upon during the meeting are expected to be implemented soon, bringing Bitcoin closer to the deployment of Taproot.Overall, the meeting addressed the ongoing discussions surrounding Taproot activation, with a focus on resolving disagreements and finding a path forward that garners support from the Bitcoin community.</summary>
