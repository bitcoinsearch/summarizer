    <summary>During a conversation on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr and Billy Tetrud discussed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Tetrud expressed his opinion that the BIPs seemed unrelated to changing the base layer of Bitcoin, although they were well organized. Dashjr clarified that BIPs are not limited to the base layer and can be used for coordinating Bitcoin software at any layer.The email exchange on the mailing list also revealed that Christopher Gilliard has created three additional BIPs related to his recent proposals. These BIPs, which focus on notification, moderation, and web of trust (WoT), can be found on Github. While the documents are well put together, they are seen as building on top of the Bitcoin platform without directly changing its base layer. Feedback, questions, and comments regarding these proposals are encouraged.To access Chris's BIPs related to his recent proposals, the links provided on Github can be followed. The first link is associated with notification, the second one with moderation, and the third one with Web of Trust (WoT). Chris is seeking feedback, questions, or comments on these proposals.</summary>
