    <summary>In a November 2013 email, Jeff Garzik proposed the idea of whitelisting nodes as a solution to the issue of frequent bans on the Bitcoin network. The proposal was shared on the Bitcoin-development mailing list hosted by SourceForge. Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist affiliated with BitPay, Inc., included a link to Intel(R) Software Adrenaline in the email, which offers free subscriptions to software experts and developers interested in staying updated with tech innovation.The purpose of Garzik's email was to initiate a discussion within the Bitcoin-development community about how to shape the rapidly evolving mobile landscape. A response to Garzik's proposal expressed gratitude for his contribution and promised to test the effectiveness of the suggested patches on some nodes the following day.On Github, there is a pull request for a bannode RPC, although it does not seem to be functional currently. In a discussion between Jeff Garzik and Gregory Maxwell, Maxwell suggested the implementation of a parallel get RPC to obtain the current list of nodes. Garzik agreed that it would be easy to add this feature. Additionally, there were requests for an IP blacklist, which would require associated RPC/config gadgetry.In another email exchange on November 22, 2013, Gregory Maxwell asked Garzik about the absence of a parallel get RPC in Bitcoin Core. Garzik responded that it would be simple to include such functionality. He also mentioned the requests for an IP blacklist, which would involve additional RPC/config gadgetry.In 2013, Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin core developer and open-source evangelist working for BitPay, Inc., added a whitelist feature to the bitcoin client software. This feature allows for the protection of whitelisted nodes from being banned. The whitelist can be managed through an entry point via RPC, configuration file, or command line. The implementation of the whitelist feature can be found in the net.cpp file of the Bitcoin Core codebase, specifically through the AddWhitelist() function. The IsWhitelisted() function checks whether a given address is potentially local, and LoadWhitelist() loads any addresses specified in the -whitelist parameter. The rpcnet.cpp file contains the addwhite() function, which attempts to add a node to the whitelist.</summary>
