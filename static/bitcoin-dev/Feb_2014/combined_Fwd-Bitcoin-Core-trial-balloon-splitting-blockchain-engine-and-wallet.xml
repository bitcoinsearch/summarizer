    <summary>A software engineer named James Hartig has highlighted the benefits of using multiple wallets on the same blockchain process. He explains that this allows for cheaper processes by eliminating unused wallet functionality. Additionally, it offers users the flexibility to customize their security measures and run the wallets as the same user without SELinux or file protections. Hartig also mentions that he personally runs three different bitcoind processes on the same server to utilize multiple wallets.In a discussion thread, Wladimir suggests running the blockchain daemon as a system service with its own uid/gid and set of Apparmor/SELinux restrictions, while having the wallet daemon run as the user. This is considered the most straightforward approach. Dustin adds that making this configuration optional would be ideal, rather than forcing everyone to adopt it. In a humorous tone, he suggests punishing those who do not use his configuration with a special task force, jokingly stating that repeated offenders would lose their BitLicense. Wladimir then reminds everyone to focus on reviewing and testing pull requests related to speeding up block synchronization.In an email exchange, Wladimir reiterates his suggestion to run the blockchain daemon as a system service and the wallet daemon as the user. Dustin agrees, noting that this setup allows for sharing one blockchain daemon among multiple users and wallet processes, even if they are not on the same machine. He includes his contact information in his signature.William Yager suggests running the network part of the core as a system service, but Wladimir argues that this may not be practical for most users. He questions if William is simply arguing for the sake of it. No further context or information is provided about this email exchange.The idea of running the network part of the core as a system service is generally seen as a good idea, but it may not be feasible for most users. Instead, a suggestion is made to segregate the two processes, with the blockchain daemon running as a system service and the wallet daemon running as the user. This approach involves implementing unique uid/gid and Apparmor/SELinux restrictions. However, there is a desire to avoid complex schemes that require running things under multiple users.In a discussion about the benefits of having separate processes for the blockchain and wallet daemons in Bitcoin software, Mike Hearn points out that without sandboxing, a separate process would not offer any advantages. Implementing sandboxing in user space is both complex and expensive. Wladimir proposes the most straightforward solution of running the blockchain daemon as a system service with Apparmor/SELinux restrictions and its own uid/gid, while running the wallet daemon as the user. This configuration allows multiple users and wallet processes to share one blockchain daemon, even if they are not on the same machine.</summary>
