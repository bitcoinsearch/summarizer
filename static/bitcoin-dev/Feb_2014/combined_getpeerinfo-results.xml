    <summary>On February 22, 2014, Ronald Hoffman encountered an issue with the &quot;services&quot; field in the latest source code level from Github. Specifically, when connected to his Java node server at 127.0.0.1:8333, the field appeared to be garbled. Initially, Hoffman suspected that he was sending a bad 'version' message, but when he tried using version 0.8.6, he received the correct results. This indicated that something had changed between versions 0.8.6 and 0.9.0.Recognizing the significance of the issue, Wladimir suggested creating an issue on Github to address it. Hoffman proceeded to find and fix the problem, which turned out to be a Windows inttypes.h border case. As a means of testing, Hoffman provided a link for others to use.In further discussions, Hoffman shared a conversation where he used bitcoin-cli to communicate with bitcoind (version 0.9.0), showing the &quot;services&quot; field as &quot;0000000164x&quot;. Wladimir inquired about the specific git revision Hoffman was testing with, the compiler used to build it, and the platform it was running on. Additionally, Wladimir asked whether all peers in the getpeerinfo command showed up garbled or if it was just Hoffman's. When Wladimir tested getpeerinfo locally, he found that all his peers displayed the expected value of &quot;&quot;services&quot; : &quot;00000001&quot;.In summary, the latest source code level from Github revealed a garbled &quot;services&quot; field when connected to Bitcoind on a Java node server at 127.0.0.1:8333. Despite initially suspecting a bad 'version' message, using version 0.8.6 resulted in correct results. A comparison of the &quot;services&quot; field using the bitcoin-cli command getpeerinfo showed that in version 0.9.0 it appeared garbled as &quot;0000000164x&quot;, whereas in version 0.8.6 it was &quot;00000001&quot;.</summary>
