    <summary>On November 4, 2011, Gavin Andresen, a prominent Bitcoin developer, posted on the Bitcoin-development mailing list about removing the bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz file. He explained that he made this decision because the file was not sane and needed to teach the Qt build to statically link dependencies. Despite concerns from the Bitcoin community, Andresen expressed confidence that these issues would be addressed, and a release candidate 3 for Mac and Linux users could be expected once the deployment issues were resolved.In the email thread, Douglas Huff responded to Andresen's post, inquiring about the mac build and mentioning that he had built without any issues on version 10.7. The thread also included a signature.asc file attached to it. The post also provided a link for registering for the RSA(R) Conference 2012 with a discount of $700 if registered by November 18. Andresen had previously tagged v0.5.0rc2 with Gitian-built binaries uploaded to https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.5.0/test/. He mentioned that the windows setup.exe had been tested in an XP virtual machine and installed and ran well. However, the windows zip and the 32/64 bit Linux .tar.gz files still needed sanity testing. Shasums for the uploads were provided as df994f18b6b715f6e0451b98b55ddd1946f2f353 (bitcoin-0.5.0-win32-setup.exe), bfbad8acae987467976d535e48653ac7e28c6c76 (bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz), and fb2cfd2d8ad45269025a4604c679364a934796b4 (bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-win32.zip). However, Mac builds were experiencing delays due to issues in creating a standalone .app. Shasums for Gavin Andresen's v0.5.0rc2 gitian.zips were also provided.In summary, Gavin Andresen's removal of the bitcoin-0.5.0rc2-linux.tar.gz file was motivated by the need to address sanity and dependency linking issues in the Qt build. Despite concerns, he remained confident that these issues would be resolved, allowing for the release of a candidate 3 version for Mac and Linux users. The email thread included responses from Douglas Huff and an attached signature.asc file. Additionally, the post offered a link to register for the RSA(R) Conference 2012 with a discount if registered by November 18. Andresen also provided information about Gitian-built binaries and their testing status, along with shasums for the uploads. However, Mac builds were experiencing delays due to difficulties in creating a standalone .app.</summary>
