    <summary>The discussion highlights significant insights into the realm of hardware design, particularly focusing on ASICs for hardware wallets and the intricacies involved in achieving optimal performance within specified geometries. The conversation begins with an acknowledgment of the importance of design considerations that exclude data-dependent constant time analysis and power analysis to enhance performance. This includes the choice between flip-flops and level-triggered latches and being meticulous with clock management. The equivalence of netlist to RTL is underscored, emphasizing the role of formal proofs, facilitated by tools like Symbiyosys, in ensuring design correctness as a more comprehensive alternative to traditional unit tests.

A specific example provided is the implementation of a popcount function, where two versions were created: a complex recursive tree algorithm and a straightforward but inefficient one-liner. Formal proof was utilized to confirm the functionality of the optimized version, highlighting the necessity of having a precise model of the device under test (DUT) for effective verification. This segment reveals the potential inefficiency in creating a formal model for highly complex DUTs unless comparisons with other implementations are feasible, thus fostering collaboration.

The narrative then shifts to discuss the exploration of integrating general-purpose instructions directly aligned with the mathematical principles underlying cryptographic algorithms, inspired by a grant request. This approach aims to simplify algorithms significantly, potentially enabling readable C code to compile directly into efficient opcodes, surpassing the performance of hand-optimized SIMD code on standard Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). The challenge of maintaining innovation in a domain dominated by few players and the inherent skepticism towards new methodologies from foundries is also touched upon.

Furthermore, the conversation delves into the practical aspects of hardware design, such as the high costs associated with industry-standard tools like Synopsys and Cadence, and the pursuit of alternative approaches through collaborations, like with Sorbonne University's LIP6.fr and Chips4Makers. It mentions the Coriolis2 tool as a viable option up to 130nm processes, hinting at the ongoing challenges beyond this threshold. The dialogue concludes by addressing the necessity of keeping certain implementation tricks confidential due to their critical role in managing the netlist, the revelation of the substantial portion of an ASIC dedicated to repeater-buffers, and the operational dynamics of foundries concerning synthesis tool requirements and the economic imperative of wafer sales.
