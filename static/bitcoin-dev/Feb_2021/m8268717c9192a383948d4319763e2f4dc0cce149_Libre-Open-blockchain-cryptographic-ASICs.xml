    <summary>The discussion revolves around the challenges and innovations in ASIC design, particularly when dealing with lower geometries which struggle to drive lines over long distances. A notable strategy that emerges is the utilization of a TESTMODE for ASICs which allows the system to function normally while enabling the rerun of algorithms to obtain clean data. This tactic is highlighted as an invaluable approach for ensuring data integrity and reliability.

Further insights are shared regarding a gating method that has been implemented in several instances within the Libre Cell Library project, led by Staf Verhaegen of Chips4Makers. This method is designed to prevent errors within the Cell Library from causing irreversible damage, such as a permanent high impedance (HI) state, which would hinder further testing on different areas of the ASIC. This proactive approach underscores the importance of error management in ASIC development, ensuring that testing and verification processes can continue unimpeded.

An interesting revelation is the possibility of externally flipping bits inside an ASIC, a concept that is both amusing and unprecedented. The potential for this technique to be utilized maliciously, especially in compromising hardware wallets, is acknowledged. It is suggested that such vulnerabilities further underscore the necessity for wallet ASICs to adopt an open or libre framework. This recommendation aligns with the ethos of transparency and security, drawing attention to the need for more resilient and open hardware designs to protect against sophisticated attacks.

The conversation also references findings by the Trezor team, indicating that this dialogue is part of a broader discourse on securing hardware against emerging threats. Ensuring that wallet ASICs adhere to libre/open principles is posited as a crucial step towards safeguarding digital assets in a landscape where hardware vulnerabilities represent significant risks.</summary>
