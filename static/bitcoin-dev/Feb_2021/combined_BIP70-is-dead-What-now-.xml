    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Thomas Voegtlin expressed his dislike of the BIP70 standard but found the feature of signed payment requests useful. He believes that receiving a signed request from an exchange would serve as proof that the exchange asked him to send coins to a specific address, especially important in case of exchange hijacking. However, no exchange has implemented this feature. Andrew Kozlik shared his experimental implementation of a new payment request format in Trezor T, similar to BIP-70 but with some differences. It does not rely on X.509 and instead uses mandatory signatures for protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. It also solves problems with coin exchange by ensuring correct BTC and LTC addresses. Charles Hill shared a URL signing scheme for LNURL, which could be modified to fit Thomas' use-case. Voegtlin suggested adopting a standard for signed requests, which could guide users' decisions on which exchange to use. He would remove BIP70 support from Electrum if a new standard was adopted.</summary>
