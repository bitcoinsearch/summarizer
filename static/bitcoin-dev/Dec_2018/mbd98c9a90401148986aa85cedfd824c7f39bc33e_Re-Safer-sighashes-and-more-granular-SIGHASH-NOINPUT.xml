    <summary>The discussion between Russell O'Connor and David A. Harding revolves around the proposed changes to signature sizes within a certain technical context. The proposal suggests utilizing a 64-byte signature for the default "signing all" sighash type, while other sighash types would employ a 65-byte signature. This modification is aimed at conserving space, thereby allowing for an increased number of transactions within a block, which is considered beneficial.

However, this proposed change introduces complexities, particularly in the estimation of witness weight for multisig (multiple signature) scenarios. The challenge lies in accurately predicting the witness weight for complicated scripts, which are the primary beneficiaries of this feature. Despite the potential benefits, there is a concern that the feature may only be effective in situations where it is not needed and fail to perform in instances where it is most required. This raises questions about the practicality of implementing such a change, especially considering the issue of witness size malleability in complex scripts, which appears to be a significant concern without clear solutions or examples provided on how it could be managed or mitigated effectively.</summary>
