    <summary>Johnson Lau expressed gratitude for being introduced to a novel use of SIGHASH_NONE and acknowledged the cleverness of the proposal he was presented with. He noted that such an introduction might not have occurred if OP_CODESEPARATOR did not already exist, highlighting its role as a simplification measure. Lau raised a fundamental query about the implications of NOINPUT, which does not commit to the input in any form—be it script, code separator, or otherwise. This led him to ponder on the original comment regarding the potential insecurity or unusability of OP_CODESEPARATOR in conjunction with NOINPUT, given that NOINPUT's design inherently lacks a signature from the script's perspective. Despite recognizing the risks associated with key reuse across multiple outputs—a known issue—he questioned the emergence of any new dangers that this interaction between NOINPUT and OP_CODESEPARATOR might introduce.</summary>
