    <summary>In discussing the dynamics of multi-party protocols, especially those involving fixed-sized signatures, an interesting aspect comes to light regarding the positioning and motivations of the last signer in the transaction process. This individual uniquely knows the total weight that will result from their signature, providing them with a pivotal role in the success or failure of the transaction. Their motivation to sign, presumably, is tied to their interest in seeing the transaction succeed. However, scenarios may arise where this isn't the case, leading to potential complications.

The concept introduces the possibility of asynchronous protocols where a definitive last signer does not exist, although this idea is considered somewhat unconventional. The discussion raises concerns about the last signer potentially not being invested in the transaction's success and instead aiming to disrupt it by unnecessarily increasing the transaction's weight. This situation underscores the importance of maintaining anti-malleability measures within the protocol to safeguard against such adversarial actions.

Despite these challenges, there's an acknowledgment of the inherent issues associated with signing weight in various scenarios. Yet, the stance is taken that offering the option to sign weight, despite its drawbacks, might be more advantageous than relying solely on anti-malleability script code or non-consensus relay policies. This perspective suggests a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs involved in protocol design and the complexity of ensuring secure and efficient transactions within a multi-party context.</summary>
