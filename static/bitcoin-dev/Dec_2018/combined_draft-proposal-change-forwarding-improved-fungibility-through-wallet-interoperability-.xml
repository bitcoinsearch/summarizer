    <summary>In an email thread on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, a proposed method based on BIP32 to improve fungibility and on-chain privacy with wallets that don't prioritize these factors was questioned by James. He sought clarification on the user experience (UX) and how wallet developers could implement this feature. James also raised doubts about why a privacy-conscious user would choose a non-private wallet in the first place, and why a non-privacy-conscious user would bother enabling this option. He expressed skepticism about the proposal's usefulness from a product standpoint and questioned its need to be a BIP.The proposal, introduced by Yuval Kogman, aims to enhance fungibility and on-chain privacy in wallets that do not focus on these aspects. It suggests making minimal changes to safely forward change outputs to more specialized wallets. The draft proposal is still incomplete, with unresolved questions regarding the specific format to use. However, Yuval included two viable options in the proposal, seeking input and criticism from the mailing list. They also mentioned that the proposal is intended to complement more comprehensive proposals like BIP79.Yuval acknowledged the contributions of SirMeow, Adam Ficsor, and Adam Gibson, who reviewed earlier versions of the proposal and provided valuable feedback and suggestions. While Yuval has a slight preference for the first option presented in the proposal, they remain undecided due to tradeoffs. Hence, Yuval reached out to the mailing list for further insights and opinions.</summary>
