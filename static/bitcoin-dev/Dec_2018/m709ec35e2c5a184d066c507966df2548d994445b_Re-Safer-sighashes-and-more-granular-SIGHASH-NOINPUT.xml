    <summary>Johnson Lau raises a question regarding the necessity of supporting OP_CODESEPARATOR in the context of discussions about NOINPUT. He presents an anti-complexity viewpoint, questioning the utility of OP_CODESEPARATOR, especially since no wallet is required to support it. This inquiry stems from considerations about how OP_CODESEPARATOR interacts with proposals for handling NOINPUT, whether through the adoption of OP_MASK or by not committing to the input script in transactions. Despite presenting this perspective, Johnson acknowledges that his argument against OP_CODESEPARATOR might not be strong, indicating an openness to further discussion on its relevance and impact on Bitcoin's transaction scripting mechanisms. This exchange highlights the ongoing debate within the development community about optimizing Bitcoin's script functionality while managing complexity and ensuring compatibility across different implementations.</summary>
