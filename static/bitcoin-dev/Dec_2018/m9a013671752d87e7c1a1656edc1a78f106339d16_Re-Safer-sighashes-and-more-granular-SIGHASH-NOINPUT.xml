    <summary>David A. Harding clarifies a common misunderstanding regarding the default Replace-By-Fee (RBF) policy in Bitcoin transactions. He explains that the current policy necessitates an absolute increase in the transaction fee, aligned with the incremental relay fee, to prevent potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This requirement contrasts with some perceptions that rebroadcasting a transaction with the same fee amount but a relatively higher fee-rate due to increased transaction size is permissible under the default RBF policy. Harding also notes that despite various proposals to modify the default RBF policy, including one he proposed ([view proposal](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-February/015717.html)), the principle of requiring a minimum absolute fee increase remains as a critical defensive measure against DoS attacks.</summary>
