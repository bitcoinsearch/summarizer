    <summary>The communication highlights a technical issue regarding the proposal for signing transaction weights in a specific context. The core of the problem lies in the proposed method of signing the actual weight of transactions rather than an upper bound. While signing an upper limit would necessitate specifying this upper bound within the transaction, a challenge arises due to the lack of available space to discreetly incorporate this data. On the other hand, signing the actual weight appears straightforward since the total weight is implicitly included, but this approach introduces a complication: it requires knowledge of the total weight before the signing process can occur. This situation presents a dilemma between the ease of implementing one method and the practical constraints of executing the other, with a specific note that the DEPTH 1SUB operation is more concise than DEPTH 1 NUMNOTEQUAL, indicating a nuanced consideration in the coding or scripting related to these operations.</summary>
