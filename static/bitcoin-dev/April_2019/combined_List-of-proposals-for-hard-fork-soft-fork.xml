    <summary>A list of potential softfork proposals for SegWit v1 has been provided, which includes Schnorr signatures, MuSig, Taproot, SIGHASH_NOINPUT, signature aggregation, and MAST. It is uncertain if this list is exhaustive, as other proposals may exist. Only SIGHASH_NOINPUT currently has a BIP (BIP 118), although it may not match the version that will ultimately be integrated into Bitcoin Core.To mitigate the risk of incorrect usage of SIGHASH_NOINPUT, it is suggested that each input signed with a SIGHASH_NOINPUT signature also require a signature without SIGHASH_NOINPUT. However, further details regarding this proposal are currently unavailable.Lord His Excellency James HRMH initially requested a list of solid proposals for future consensus-driven forks to generate momentum for valuable implementations. In response to this, it is recommended that a list be compiled consisting of strong proposals and BIPs to be included in a future consensus-driven fork. This approach would help propel the development of useful implementations that might otherwise struggle to gain traction.It is important to acknowledge that not every proposal will be considered for inclusion in the fork packages. To determine which proposals should be included, pre-consensus voting could be conducted, allowing stakeholders to have a voice in the decision-making process.</summary>
