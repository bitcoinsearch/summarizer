    <summary>Pavol Rusnak, the author of the BIP39 wordlist, has confirmed that there are no restrictions on using it. However, a new standard called SLIP39 for splitting shares is being finalized and will use a different wordlist with better properties. This standard might be more suitable for Elia's project.In response to Elia's question about the license associated with the BIP39 wordlists posted on Github, Pavol Rusnak stated that there are no restrictions on using his wordlist. He also mentioned that they are currently finalizing the SLIP39 standard, which uses a different wordlist with better properties. The links to the SLIP39 standard and its associated wordlist can be found in his reply.The SLIP39 standard, along with its wordlist, can be found on SatoshiLabs' GitHub page. Elia had expressed concern about the lack of a license for the BIP39 wordlists on the GitHub BIP repository and asked if usage for other projects was permitted. It is unclear whether Elia was made aware of the unrestricted usage of the wordlist by the author.In an email thread on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, Elia inquired about using the BIP39 word lists for their own project as there was no license associated with the lists provided on Github. Pavol Rusnak, the author of the wordlist, responded that the list can be used without any restrictions and suggested the use of the SLIP39 standard for splitting shares which uses a different wordlist with better properties. The SLIP39 standard can be found on Github along with its wordlist. It is not mentioned who else will adopt the wordlist or whether it is live in Trezor.Elia is interested in using the BIP39 word lists available on the Github BIP repository for their own project. However, there is no license agreement associated with the lists provided which raises concerns about whether or not usage for other projects is permitted. Elia is unable to file issues on the repository to suggest adding a license. They are seeking information about under which license these lists are published.On GitHub, there are other resources available such as Peersm.com, a browser version for moving coins, and repositories for bitcoin-transactions and bitcoin-wallets made simple. Additionally, Torrent-live.org is recommended as a good resource for dynamic blocklists for anti-spies and private torrents.</summary>
