    <summary>In a recent discussion among members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, concerns have been raised regarding the transition to quantum-resistant signatures for Bitcoin. The primary issues identified include the potential risk to funds that are currently vulnerable, the challenge of executing this transition without destabilizing Bitcoin or causing division within its community, and the need to prevent market turmoil that could result from a disorderly shift.

A proposed solution to these challenges involves a gradual, incentive-based approach to transition towards quantum-resistant technologies. This method would begin by allowing users to add Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys to their Taproot addresses immediately, signaling an optional but forward-looking first step towards enhancing security. Following this initial phase, a soft fork could be introduced to disable vulnerable signatures. This critical move would need to come with a substantial migration period, suggested to be at least four years, to ensure ample time for adjustment and to minimize disruption.

The final stage of this transition plan focuses on the imminent threat posed by quantum computing advancements. It advocates for a phased deactivation of old signatures, moving away from abrupt changes that could induce panic and market chaos. Encouraging adoption through incentives like reduced fees for transactions that utilize secure protocols and developing wallet tools designed for an easy transition are seen as essential strategies. Additionally, continuous monitoring of addresses still using vulnerable signatures would be vital in managing risks effectively.

Key to this approach is the emphasis on clear communication and gradual implementation. Rather than enforcing a sudden "D-Day" of change, this strategy aims to provide options and flexibility, ensuring that the transition does not betray Bitcoin's foundational principles or unfairly disadvantage any user. This perspective underscores a thoughtful and inclusive approach to navigating the challenges posed by quantum computing, prioritizing the security and integrity of Bitcoin without compromising its core values.</summary>
