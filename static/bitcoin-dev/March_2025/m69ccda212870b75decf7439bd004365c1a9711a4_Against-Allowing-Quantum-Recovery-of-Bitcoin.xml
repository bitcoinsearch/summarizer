    <summary>In the ongoing discussions about transitioning Bitcoin to quantum-resistant signatures, several key concerns have emerged among developers and stakeholders. These include deliberations on how to address the vulnerability of funds, ensuring the stability of Bitcoin during the transition, and preventing potential market chaos that could arise from a disorderly shift. A proposed solution involves a structured, phased approach aimed at mitigating these concerns while fostering community consensus.

The first phase of this proposed transition strategy emphasizes the inclusion of optional Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys to Taproot addresses, allowing users to voluntarily enhance their security against quantum threats. This initial step serves as a preparatory measure, enabling stakeholders to adapt gradually without immediate pressure or risk.

Subsequently, the strategy advocates for the implementation of a soft fork well before quantum computing poses a direct threat to the integrity of Bitcoin's existing cryptographic signatures. This fork would disable vulnerable signatures, incorporating a lengthy migration period of at least four years to facilitate a smooth and gradual transition for all users. Such a timeframe is critical to ensure widespread adoption and minimal disruption to Bitcoin's operations and user base.

The final phase of the transition plan focuses on the imminent arrival of quantum threats, proposing a gradual phase-out of old signatures rather than an abrupt cessation. This approach aims to incentivize adoption through mechanisms like lower transaction fees for those utilizing secure PQC-enabled transactions and providing wallet tools designed to ease the transition process. Additionally, real-time monitoring of vulnerable addresses is suggested as a means to mitigate risks associated with this transition.

A crucial aspect of this plan is the emphasis on clear communication and the avoidance of panic-inducing measures. Instead of imposing sudden changes, the strategy recommends a methodical deactivation of outdated Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), ensuring that participants do not feel coerced or left at a disadvantage. By prioritizing options and incentives over mandates, the proposed transition seeks to uphold Bitcoin's foundational principles while navigating the challenges posed by quantum computing advancements.</summary>
