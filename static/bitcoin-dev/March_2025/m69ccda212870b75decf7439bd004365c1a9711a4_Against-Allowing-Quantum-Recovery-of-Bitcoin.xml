    <summary>In a recent discourse among the Bitcoin development community, concerns have been raised regarding the transition to quantum-resistant signatures. The primary issues highlighted include the handling of vulnerable funds, ensuring the stability of Bitcoin during the transition, and preventing market chaos due to abrupt changes. A proposed solution emphasizes a gradual, incentive-based approach to migrating towards Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys without causing disruption within the community or the market.

The suggested strategy consists of a three-phase plan aimed at smoothly integrating quantum-resistant mechanisms into the Bitcoin protocol. Initially, it advocates for the voluntary addition of PQC keys to Taproot addresses, allowing users to start securing their funds against potential quantum threats without mandatory enforcement. This phase aims to create awareness and prepare the ecosystem for upcoming changes without immediate pressure.

Subsequently, the proposition includes a pre-emptive soft fork designed to disable vulnerable signatures well before any real quantum threat materializes. This soft fork would introduce a lengthy migration period, recommended to last at least four years, providing ample time for users and services to adapt to the new standards. Such a proactive approach is intended to ensure a seamless transition by gradually reducing reliance on potentially insecure cryptographic methods.

The final stage of the plan addresses the imminent risk of quantum attacks by phasing out old signatures in a controlled manner rather than through a sudden cutoff. This gradual deactivation process is meant to incentivize adoption of secure transactions through benefits such as lower fees and the availability of tools that ease the transition process for wallet users. Furthermore, active monitoring of vulnerable addresses is proposed as a measure to manage risks effectively.

This comprehensive approach seeks to mitigate panic and avoid any form of coercion or disadvantage, focusing instead on clear communication and voluntary participation. By offering incentives and ensuring a transparent, phased transition, the goal is to preserve Bitcoin's core principles while enhancing its security against quantum computing threats.</summary>
