    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the challenge of transitioning Bitcoin to quantum-resistant signatures was addressed. The core concerns include the handling of funds vulnerable to quantum attacks, the impact of transition on Bitcoin's stability and community unity, and the avoidance of market turmoil during this significant change. A proposed solution emphasizes a gradual, incentive-based shift rather than abrupt adjustments to mitigate uncertainty.

The strategy for moving towards quantum-resistant signatures involves a three-phase approach. Initially, it allows users the option to enhance their Taproot addresses with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys. This preemptive measure sets the groundwork for a smoother transition. Following this, a soft fork aimed at disabling vulnerable signatures would be introduced well before the quantum threat materializes, ensuring a lengthy migration period of at least four years to accommodate all users adequately. The final phase focuses on the gradual phasing out of outdated signatures as the quantum threat becomes imminent, prioritizing a smooth transition over a forced, rapid change.

To encourage adoption of these new measures, incentives such as lower transaction fees for secure transactions are suggested, alongside the development of wallet tools designed to ease the transition process. Monitoring of potentially vulnerable addresses in real-time is recommended to further mitigate risk. Importantly, the approach advocates for avoiding panic through gradual implementation and clear communication, ensuring that no part of the community feels compelled or left behind during the transition. The goal is not to impose stringent rules or confiscate assets but to offer a structured pathway for Bitcoin to evolve securely without betraying its foundational principles.</summary>
