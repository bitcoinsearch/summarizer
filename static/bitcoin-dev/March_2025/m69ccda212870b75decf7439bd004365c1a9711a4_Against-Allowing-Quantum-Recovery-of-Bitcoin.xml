    <summary>The discussions around transitioning Bitcoin to quantum-resistant signatures have illuminated several key concerns among developers and stakeholders. The primary issues revolve around the treatment of funds currently vulnerable to quantum attacks, the potential impact of a transition on Bitcoin's stability and community cohesion, and the avoidance of market turmoil that could result from a disorderly shift to quantum resistance.

A proposed strategy for this transition suggests a gradual and incentive-based approach over abrupt changes, thereby minimizing uncertainty. Initially, there is an encouragement for users to augment their Taproot addresses with optional Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys. This early phase aims to prepare the ecosystem for future changes without immediate disruption.

Subsequently, the plan outlines a soft fork to disable vulnerable signatures ahead of any tangible quantum threat, providing a lengthy migration period of at least four years. This step is designed to ensure a smooth transition by allowing ample time for adjustment and preparation across the network.

The final stage of the proposed roadmap involves a cautious phasing out of old signatures as the quantum threat becomes imminent, avoiding a sudden and forced changeover. To facilitate adoption during this period, incentives such as lower transaction fees for secure transactions are suggested, alongside the development of wallet tools that support users through the transition. Additionally, monitoring vulnerable addresses in real-time is recommended to further mitigate risk.

Central to this proposal is the aim to maintain calm and avoid inducing panic within the community. By avoiding a precipitous "D-Day" scenario where everything changes instantaneously, the strategy focuses on gradual deactivation of old, insecure Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). Clear and continuous communication is emphasized to ensure that no participant feels compelled or left at a disadvantage during the transition. This approach underscores a commitment to preserving Bitcoin's foundational philosophies while navigating the challenges presented by quantum computing advances.</summary>
