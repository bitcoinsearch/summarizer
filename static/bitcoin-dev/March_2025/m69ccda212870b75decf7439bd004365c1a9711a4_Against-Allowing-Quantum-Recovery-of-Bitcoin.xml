    <summary>The discussions on transitioning Bitcoin to quantum-resistant signatures have raised significant concerns among developers, particularly regarding the treatment of vulnerable funds, the potential impact on Bitcoin’s stability, and the risk of market chaos due to a disorderly transition. A proposed solution involves a gradual, incentive-based approach to adopting Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys alongside current cryptographic methods, aimed at ensuring both security and stability within the Bitcoin network. 

This approach suggests initially allowing users to add optional PQC keys to their Taproot addresses to begin integrating quantum-resistant measures without disrupting current operations. As the quantum threat becomes more tangible, a soft fork could be introduced to disable vulnerable signatures. This would not be an immediate change but rather come with a substantial migration period of at least four years, providing ample time for adaptation and minimizing the risk of division within the community. The final phase of this plan involves the gradual deactivation of old signatures as the quantum threat becomes imminent, prioritizing a smooth transition over sudden, forced changes.

To encourage adoption of PQC keys, incentives such as reduced transaction fees for secure transactions could be offered, alongside the development of wallet tools designed to ease the transition process. Monitoring of vulnerable addresses in real-time is suggested as a means to further mitigate risks associated with the transition. Importantly, the strategy emphasizes clear communication and gradual implementation to avoid panic and ensure no participant feels disadvantaged or coerced into the transition. This method aims not at imposing new rules or confiscating assets but at providing a structured and voluntary path towards enhancing Bitcoin’s resilience against quantum computing threats, aligning with the cryptocurrency's foundational philosophy.</summary>
