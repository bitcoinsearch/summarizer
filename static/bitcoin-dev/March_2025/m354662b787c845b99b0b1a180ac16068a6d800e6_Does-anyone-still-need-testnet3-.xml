    <summary>In a recent discussion among Bitcoin developers, the primary challenge identified with using testnet3 revolves around the difficulty for developers to obtain coins, particularly due to high transaction fees. A creative solution proposed involves developing an application that would facilitate the swapping of coins between testnet3 and testnet4. Additionally, the idea of creating an Automated Market Maker (AMM) was suggested as a potential method to streamline this process. The proposal is currently in the ideation phase, with the initiator open to pursuing the project if there is sufficient interest from the community. This conversation highlights the ongoing efforts within the Bitcoin development community to address technical challenges and improve the ecosystem's infrastructure for developers.</summary>
