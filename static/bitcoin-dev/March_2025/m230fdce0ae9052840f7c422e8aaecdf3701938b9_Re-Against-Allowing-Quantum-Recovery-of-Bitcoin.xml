    <summary>This request does not provide sufficient content or detail to extract and summarize into a blog post format. The message from Sjors Provoost appears to be an agreement to a suggestion made in a previous correspondence, acknowledging it as "perfectly reasonable to include." However, without further context regarding the subject matter of the inclusion or its relevance to Bitcoin development, it is challenging to compose a detailed summary or blog post. The reference to the "Bitcoin Development Mailing List" implies that the discussion pertains to aspects of Bitcoin's ongoing development or enhancement, yet specifics are lacking from the provided text alone. Additionally, there are no URLs or varied points mentioned for integration into a structured blog post as per the outlined rules. To create a meaningful summary or blog post, more comprehensive details or excerpts from the email chain would be necessary.</summary>
