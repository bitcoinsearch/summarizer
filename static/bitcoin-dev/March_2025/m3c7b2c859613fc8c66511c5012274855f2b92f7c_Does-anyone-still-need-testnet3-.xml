    <summary>Testnet 4 was officially proposed in BIP94 and has been supported by Bitcoin Core starting with version 28, addressing the increasing impracticality of using testnet3 due to block storms. Despite the inability to delete the network, users have the option to continue operating with testnet3 by maintaining their node software independently. This adaptability ensures that those invested in the older testnet can still operate indefinitely, highlighting the enduring nature of blockchain networks and the communityâ€™s commitment to backward compatibility.

The introduction of testnet4 is part of a broader effort to enhance testing environments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, aiming to provide more reliable and practical options for developers. This move signifies recognition of the evolving needs of the Bitcoin development community, as well as an acknowledgment of the challenges posed by the previous test environment. The possibility of creating a pure proof-of-work permissionless signet, devoid of any signatures and employing OP_TRUE as its challenge, further exemplifies the innovative approaches being explored to improve network functionality and accessibility.

The ongoing support for testnet3, as discussed, is contingent upon the community's needs. Developers, libraries, staging environments, and testnet wallets relying on testnet3 are encouraged to communicate their requirements, particularly if transitioning away from testnet3 poses significant challenges or delays. This feedback mechanism is vital for ensuring that future versions of Bitcoin Core, such as v29, remain inclusive and accommodating to all users, irrespective of their readiness or technical preferences to migrate to newer testnet versions. The dialogue around these developments underscores the importance of community feedback in guiding the trajectory of Bitcoin's technological advancements.
