    <summary>The introduction of Testnet4 aimed to address specific issues encountered with its predecessor, Testnet3, notably the challenges posed by the difficulty reset mechanism. Despite intentions for improvement, Testnet4 adopted a similar rule regarding difficulty resets, which has continued to cause significant problems. The primary purpose of a testnet is to replicate the Bitcoin mainnet environment, complementing more controlled testing frameworks such as Signet. Testnet4's rationale for implementing a difficulty reset was to enable developers to mine blocks on their laptops, facilitating a more accessible and practical development process. However, this approach has led to a conflict between maintaining a permissionless network characteristic of proof-of-work (PoW) systems and the need for a controlled environment where specific users are granted particular privileges, as seen with Signet.

This dichotomy has resulted in Testnet4 not achieving its intended objectives: it neither accurately simulates the Bitcoin mainnet nor provides an effective platform for developers to mine blocks easily on personal devices. The proposed solution to these issues is the removal of the difficulty reset rule from Testnet4. This adjustment would occur through a flag day hard fork scheduled for January 1, 2026. Setting the date far in advance aims to minimize any potential disruptions this change might cause. Such a timeline would allow for thorough review, merging, and inclusion of the necessary patch in the next major release of Bitcoin Core. Additionally, it would enable backporting to previous releases and adoption by the infrastructure currently operating on Testnet4, ensuring a smooth transition for the test network.

This proposal underscores the balance that must be struck between creating a testing environment that mirrors the operational realities of the Bitcoin mainnet and providing developers with a practical and accessible platform for testing new features and capabilities.</summary>
