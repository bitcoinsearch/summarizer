    <title>New Proposal：String Substring Search in Bitcoin Script - OP_ISSUBSTR</title>

    <summary>The new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) introduces two innovative string opcodes, OP_ISSUBSTR and OP_ISSUBSTRVERIFY, aiming to enhance Bitcoin script functionalities by allowing the verification of substrings within strings. This addition is significant as it marks a move towards reintroducing string operations in Bitcoin scripts, which had been previously disabled due to security concerns. The proposal outlines that these opcodes would perform substring checks without altering the blockchain state, thereby maintaining security.

The execution process for these opcodes involves comparing two strings taken from the top of the stack using standard library functions, with the result being pushed back onto the stack. Specifically, if the operation is conducted with OP_ISSUBSTRVERIFY, it verifies the condition and will throw an error if the check fails, without pushing any result onto the stack. This mechanism ensures that the operations are secure and do not compromise the integrity of the blockchain.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the current limitations faced by developers due to the absence of string operations in Bitcoin scripts. This has led to increased complexity in development, reliance on off-chain processing, or the incorporation of complex scripts that potentially introduce centralized dependencies. The reintroduction of string operations, starting with OP_ISSUBSTR, aims to address these challenges by facilitating on-chain string logic processing, thus enhancing script functionality and flexibility without compromising security.

The advantages of incorporating OP_ISSUBSTR into Bitcoin scripts are manifold. It allows for enhanced script functionality, supports string searching necessary for various applications, converts non-deterministic algorithms into deterministic ones through substring verification, simplifies address verification logic, and fosters better integration with modern programming languages. These benefits collectively contribute to making Bitcoin scripting more versatile and developer-friendly.

For those interested in exploring the full details of the proposal, the complete documentation and reference implementation can be found at [the provided GitHub link](https://github.com/Weichu-Deng/bips/blob/OP_ISSUBSTR/bip-yongdong%20wu-OP_ISSUBSTR.md). This proposal represents a proactive step towards expanding the capabilities of Bitcoin scripts to meet the growing needs and challenges faced by developers in the cryptocurrency space.</summary>
