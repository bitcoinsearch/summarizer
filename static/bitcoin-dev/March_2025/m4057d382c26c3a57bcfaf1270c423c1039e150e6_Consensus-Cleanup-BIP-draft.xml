    <summary>In a recent discussion among programmers, the introduction of a new consensus rule specifically aimed at simplifying the implementation of Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets has sparked considerable debate. The rule is designed to eliminate the need for these wallets to acquire the coinbase transaction, theoretically making them easier to implement. However, this change has been met with skepticism and criticism from various quarters.

Critics argue that aside from the marginal benefit it offers to SPV wallet implementation, the new rule fails to address any of the initial problems it was purported to solve, including those related to security, performance, or even code simplification for nodes. This has led to a consensus among some experts that the rule's only real justification lies in its slight convenience for SPV wallets, which does not seem to warrant the introduction of a discontinuity in the system. The concern here is that such a discontinuity, induced solely by a desire to simplify a specific aspect of wallet implementation, could have unforeseen negative impacts down the line.

Furthermore, there is an ongoing discussion regarding the appropriateness of basing consensus changes on implementation details, particularly when these details do not contribute to solving broader issues within the system. This perspective suggests a disconnect between the rule's intended purpose and its actual necessity, raising questions about the basis on which consensus decisions are being made.

Despite these criticisms, there is acknowledgment of the effort put into addressing the set of issues surrounding this topic by various contributors. The dialogue reflects a broader debate on the principles guiding the evolution of consensus rules and the importance of grounding these rules in solid justification rather than conveniences of implementation.</summary>
