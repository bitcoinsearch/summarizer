    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discourse initiated by Boris Nagaev on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List raises a pivotal concern regarding the security and accessibility of time-locked coins within the Bitcoin network, particularly in scenarios where quantum computing advancements may necessitate the migration of funds to maintain security. Time-locked coins, which are designed to become spendable only after reaching a predetermined deadline, present a unique challenge. This is because their owners cannot preemptively migrate or secure their funds before this deadline, unlike regular Bitcoin holders who might have the flexibility to respond to security advisories or technological shifts.

One specific scenario highlighted involves inheritance or smart contracts, where coins are set to unlock at a future date, for example, 2030. If the Bitcoin community were to decide on a fund migration due to quantum computing threats or any other reason by 2029, those holding time-locked coins would find themselves unable to access or secure their inheritance as intended. The question posed revolves around how such situations could be reconciled with Bitcoin's underlying principles, questioning whether these cases could be dismissed as acceptable losses or if there might exist a strategy to address these challenges without compromising the integrity or foundational concepts of Bitcoin.

This conversation underscores a broader dialogue within the cryptocurrency community about the adaptation and evolution of blockchain technologies in response to emerging threats and advancements, such as quantum computing. It also highlights the need for solutions that cater to all types of transactions and holdings within digital currencies, including those that are not immediately accessible or controllable by their owners.</summary>
