    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>In the ongoing discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a significant concern has been raised by Boris regarding the fate of time-locked coins in the context of potential quantum computing threats to Bitcoin. Time-locked coins are unique in that they become spendable only after reaching a predetermined deadline. This feature is particularly relevant for scenarios such as inheritance or specific contractual agreements facilitated through smart contracts. The crux of the issue lies in the inherent vulnerability of these time-locked funds to advancements in quantum computing before they become accessible to their rightful owners.

Given the nature of Bitcoin and its underlying technologies, regular holders have the luxury of preemptively migrating their funds to more secure protocols or wallets in anticipation of quantum vulnerabilities. However, this preemptive measure is not available for the owners of time-locked coins. These individuals are essentially locked out of their funds until the specified unlock date, rendering them incapable of taking any action to protect their assets in the face of an impending quantum threat. This situation presents a significant dilemma: should the loss of these time-locked coins be considered an acceptable sacrifice in the name of progress and security enhancement, or should measures be taken to ensure these funds remain recoverable without compromising the foundational principles of Bitcoin?

The discussion brings to light the broader implications of evolving cryptographic challenges and the necessity for the Bitcoin community to explore solutions that accommodate all types of users, including those with time-locked coins. This debate underscores the delicate balance between advancing security measures to protect against quantum computing threats and adhering to the decentralized, immutable ethos that Bitcoin was built upon. As the conversation unfolds, it becomes evident that finding a resolution that satisfies both the technical and ethical considerations of this issue will be paramount for the future integrity and inclusivity of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
