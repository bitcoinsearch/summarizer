    <summary>In a recent discussion, the inevitability of Quantum Computing (QC) and its impact on Bitcoin was explored with a sense of urgency. The consensus appears to be that if QC becomes a tangible threat in the near future, the only viable response to protect Bitcoin would be to implement a freeze fork. This approach is seen as a critical measure to ensure the survival of Bitcoin by minimizing the number of coins affected.

The dialogue also touched upon the challenges associated with the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) schemes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite skepticism from some quarters, there's an acknowledgment of the growing interest and demand for PQC-enabled wallets, particularly among users who prioritize long-term storage solutions. This suggests that while the transition may present obstacles, the community's concern over quantum threats could drive acceptance and implementation of PQC features.

Furthermore, the discussion debunked the notion that spending from a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point could be a sufficient security measure without an explicit soft-fork to restrict such spendings. The underlying message is that there's a significant, albeit cautious, interest in integrating PQC into Bitcoin today, contradicting the idea that no one is looking to utilize such technologies.

This conversation underscores the critical crossroads at which the Bitcoin development community finds itself, poised between the theoretical threat of quantum computing and the practical steps needed to mitigate such risks through technological adaptation and consensus.</summary>
