    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Sjors Provoost and other participants discussed the implications of quantum computing (QC) on Bitcoin and the potential necessity of a "freeze fork" to prevent the cryptocurrency from becoming obsolete in the face of such technological advancements. The conversation highlighted the inevitability of confronting QC's reality and the critical steps needed to minimize the adverse effects on Bitcoin holdings. The discussion underscored that while adoption poses a significant challenge for any post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic scheme, dismissing the willingness of wallet developers and users to adapt to these changes is overly skeptical.

Provoost argued against the notion that wallets, especially those intended for long-term storage, would ignore the need for PQ compatibility. He emphasized the growing concern and demand within the community for PQ solutions, suggesting that this interest could drive the selection of wallets with PQ features. This perspective challenges the view that PQ readiness might be overlooked by wallet developers and users.

Furthermore, the debate touched upon the technical feasibility of using a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point as a stopgap solution until a more comprehensive PQ strategy is implemented. However, Provoost noted that relying solely on a NUMS point would be insufficient without an explicit soft-fork to prevent spending from it, highlighting the complexities involved in transitioning Bitcoin to a PQ-resistant state. 

The overall tone of the conversation pointed towards a proactive stance on addressing the quantum threat to Bitcoin, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and the active consideration of PQ cryptographic measures in the development and selection of Bitcoin wallets and storage solutions.</summary>
