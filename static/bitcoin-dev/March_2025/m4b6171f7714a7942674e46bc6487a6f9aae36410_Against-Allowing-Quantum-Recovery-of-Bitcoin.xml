    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the critical stance on preparing Bitcoin for the potential advent of quantum computing (QC) and the necessity of implementing a freeze fork to safeguard its future. The consensus suggests that ignoring the quantum threat would lead to Bitcoin's demise, underscoring the importance of proactive measures to minimize the impact on the cryptocurrency. The conversation touches on the challenges associated with adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes but highlights an existing interest and demand within the community. The skepticism around the complete non-adoption of PQC wallets is debunked, pointing out that users interested in long-term storage might indeed prefer and seek out wallets with PQC capabilities.

Furthermore, the dialogue brings to light the technical considerations and debates surrounding the effectiveness of using a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point as a solution. It is argued that without explicitly soft-forking to prevent spending from such NUMS points, this approach alone would be insufficient. This technical detail indicates the nuanced understanding and approaches being considered within the development community to address the quantum threat.

Overall, the conversation reflects a deep engagement with the complexities of integrating PQC into Bitcoin, acknowledging both the technological hurdles and the community's readiness to adopt new security measures. The commitment to ensuring Bitcoin's resilience in the face of quantum computing advancements underscores the strategic planning required to navigate future technological landscapes.</summary>
