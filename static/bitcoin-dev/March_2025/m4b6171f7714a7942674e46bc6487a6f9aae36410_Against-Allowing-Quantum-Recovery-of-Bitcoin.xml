    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the topic of Quantum Computing (QC) and its implications for Bitcoin were explored. The conversation revolved around the necessity of a "freeze fork" in the event that quantum computing becomes a tangible threat to Bitcoin's security. This preventative measure would aim to minimize the number of coins affected by any potential quantum computing breaches.

The email highlighted the challenges associated with adopting post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic schemes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite these challenges, there is a noted skepticism towards the notion that wallets wouldn't adapt to incorporate PQ features. Given the current apprehensions surrounding quantum computing and its impact on Bitcoin, it's argued that there's a significant interest in PQ capabilities, especially among users interested in long-term storage solutions. This counters the argument that there would be no demand or use for post-quantum cryptography within Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the discussion touches upon the technical feasibility of implementing changes to Bitcoin's protocol to defend against quantum attacks. Specifically, it mentions the possibility of a soft fork to prevent spending from non-upgraded points, known as NUMS points, as a method to enhance Bitcoin's resilience against quantum threats. This suggests a proactive approach to securing Bitcoin against future quantum computing advancements, underscoring the community's commitment to preserving Bitcoin's integrity in the face of evolving technological challenges.</summary>
