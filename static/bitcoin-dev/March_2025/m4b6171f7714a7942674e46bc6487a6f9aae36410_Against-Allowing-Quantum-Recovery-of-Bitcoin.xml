    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the conversation centered around the imperative measures required to safeguard Bitcoin against the potential threats posed by quantum computing (QC). The consensus was that waiting until the emergence of quantum computing becomes an undeniable reality would be too late. To mitigate this risk, the implementation of a freeze fork was suggested as a necessary action. This preventive measure aims to minimize the number of coins affected by ensuring early preparedness.

The debate also touched upon the challenges associated with the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic schemes within the Bitcoin network. Despite skepticism regarding wallet adoption for PQ schemes, there is an acknowledgment of a growing demand for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in Bitcoin. This interest is not just theoretical but is driven by practical considerations, especially for those looking at long-term storage solutions. The argument made is that while some may disregard the necessity for PQC, considering it unlikely for wallets to support such technology, there exists a significant portion of the community that sees PQC as a desirable feature. This subset of users might prioritize wallets that offer PQC capabilities, highlighting a tangible demand for such features within the ecosystem.

Furthermore, the discussion delves into the technical feasibility of implementing PQC within Bitcoin's framework. It rejects the idea that using a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point alone would suffice as a solution to the quantum threat. Instead, it suggests that a conscious effort to soft-fork out certain spending practices associated with NUMS points could be a viable approach. This perspective underlines the complexity and necessity of actively preparing Bitcoin's infrastructure to resist quantum computing threats, rather than passively waiting and risking the entire network's security.

Overall, the discourse emphasizes the importance of proactive measures and adaptations within the Bitcoin development community to address the impending challenges posed by quantum computing. By fostering an environment that supports the integration of post-quantum cryptography, Bitcoin can aim to secure its longevity and resilience against future technological advancements.</summary>
