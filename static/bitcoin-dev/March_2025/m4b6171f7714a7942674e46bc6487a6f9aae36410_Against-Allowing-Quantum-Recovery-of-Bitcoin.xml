    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, an important topic surrounding the future security of Bitcoin in the event of quantum computing (QC) becoming a pervasive reality was broached. The core argument presented is that to prevent Bitcoin from becoming obsolete due to advancements in QC technology, a proactive approach involving a 'freeze fork' might be necessary. This strategy would aim to minimize the potential impact on the digital currency by ensuring that as few coins as possible are affected.

The conversation further delves into the challenges associated with adopting post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic schemes for Bitcoin. Despite the perceived hurdles, there's an acknowledgment of the growing demand and interest in PQ capabilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This interest is not only speculative but is driven by genuine concern over the long-term viability and security of Bitcoin in the face of quantum computing advancements.

Critics of the feasibility of a widespread adoption of PQ wallets for Bitcoin argue that there may be a lack of incentive for users seeking short-term storage solutions to opt for such wallets. However, the counterargument highlights a noticeable demand for PQ security features among users looking for long-term storage solutions, indicating a market segment that values and possibly expects PQ readiness in their choice of wallets.

The discourse also touches on the technical specifics of implementing PQ security measures, including the limitations of using a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point without an accompanying soft fork to restrict spending from it. This indicates a nuanced understanding of both the theoretical and practical considerations involved in enhancing Bitcoin's resilience to quantum computing threats.

Overall, the conversation underscores an ongoing debate within the Bitcoin development community regarding the best path forward in preparing for the advent of quantum computing. The emphasis is on striking a balance between proactive measures to safeguard Bitcoin's future while navigating the complexities of adoption and implementation of PQ cryptographic solutions.</summary>
