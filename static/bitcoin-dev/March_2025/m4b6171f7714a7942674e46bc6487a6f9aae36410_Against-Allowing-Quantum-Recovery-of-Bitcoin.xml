    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the critical nature of preparing Bitcoin for the eventuality of quantum computing (QC) becoming a significant reality. The consensus points towards the necessity of implementing a freeze fork as a preventive measure to protect Bitcoin from becoming obsolete in the face of quantum advancements. This approach is highlighted as the only viable solution to ensure the survival of Bitcoin, aiming to minimize the impact by freezing the smallest possible number of coins.

The conversation also delves into the challenges associated with the adoption of post-quantum (PQ) schemes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite skepticism regarding wallet adoption for PQ Bitcoin, there's an acknowledgment of a growing interest and demand for post-quantum cryptography (PQC) features, especially among users interested in long-term storage solutions. The dialogue refutes the notion that wallets would disregard PQC, pointing out that the current discourse around PQ Bitcoin, fueled by genuine concerns, underscores a substantial interest in PQC-enabled wallets.

Additionally, the emails touch upon the technical feasibility and demand for implementing PQC in Bitcoin. It is argued that simply relying on a Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) point is insufficient without a specific soft-fork to restrict spending from such a point. This stance underlines the existing demand for PQC in Bitcoin, suggesting that ignoring the potential for PQC integration is not only improbable but also neglects the voiced concerns and needs of the community seeking resilience against quantum threats.</summary>
