    <summary>The discussion raises an important consideration regarding the safety of spending timelocked coins that have not yet exposed their public keys. It highlights a security perspective where, in the event quantum computing advances significantly, it might still be considered safe to spend these coins as long as they are spent before quantum computers can reverse engineer the key during the transaction's mempool duration. This point underscores the nuanced risks associated with using extremely long time locks on cryptocurrencies, pointing out that while such mechanisms can prevent unauthorized spending, they also introduce potential vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include exposure to protocol weaknesses that might necessitate fund migration to maintain security.

Moreover, the conversation touches on personal reservations about the practicality of setting time locks for an extended period, such as more than a year or two. This caution stems from the understanding that long-term time locks could inadvertently lead to missed opportunities, especially in scenarios involving controversial chain forks. In such cases, the inability to move funds due to time locks could prevent users from economically expressing their preferences or protecting their assets by choosing between competing chains. This aspect serves as a reminder of the broader implications of time-locked funds beyond their immediate security benefits, including the impact on user autonomy and the dynamic nature of blockchain ecosystems.</summary>
