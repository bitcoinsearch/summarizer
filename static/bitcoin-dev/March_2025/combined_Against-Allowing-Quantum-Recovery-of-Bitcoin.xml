    <summary>The integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into Bitcoin is a critical discussion point among developers, focusing on the necessity to preemptively adopt quantum-resistant mechanisms to safeguard against potential quantum computing threats. A proposition within this dialogue is the introduction of a simple PQC method, like OP_HASHBASEDSIG, which could be embedded in tapscript to enable the inclusion of PQC public keys in wallet outputs. This preventive measure aims to provide a substantial safety margin against the eventual ability of quantum computers to compromise current cryptographic protections while maintaining future actionability regarding non-PQC secured coins.

A notable concern addressed is the autonomy of individuals choosing not to migrate their addresses to enhanced security protocols. The discourse suggests allowing users to continue utilizing their existing addresses by verifying ownership through key signatures, thus providing an option to opt out of update schemes without compromising system integrity. This emphasizes respect for user sovereignty over digital assets and balances security enhancements with individual autonomy and choice.

Timelocks as a security feature against quantum threats are also discussed, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between leveraging cryptographic advancements for enhanced security and the practical considerations of adaptability in the fast-paced evolution of blockchain technology. The conversation sheds light on the limitations and vulnerabilities introduced by timelocks, particularly their exposure to quantum attacks and the strategic implications of committing funds to long-term locks.

The broader debate on quantum computing's threat to Bitcoin encompasses various perspectives on how to address potentially vulnerable funds. This includes discussions on whether to render these funds inaccessible to preempt theft by quantum-capable entities or maintain access, risking quantum-enabled asset seizures. These deliberations touch upon fundamental Bitcoin principles like censorship resistance, forward compatibility, and conservatism, underscoring the ethical, technical, and philosophical challenges posed by quantum computing advances.

Ultimately, the discourse around PQC adoption, digital sovereignty, timelock vulnerabilities, and quantum computing threats illustrates the complex interplay between advancing security measures and adhering to Bitcoin's foundational principles. As the possibility of quantum computing advances, the Bitcoin community is tasked with navigating these multifaceted issues to ensure the network's long-term viability and security while respecting the ethos of decentralization and user autonomy.</summary>
