    <summary>Matt Corallo proposes an innovative solution addressing the sequencing dilemma within Bitcoin's development, particularly focusing on tapscript (script path) and the application of a PCQ (Probabilistic Constant-time Quantum) scheme. This approach introduces a mechanism that could potentially disable one or more NUMS (Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve) points, which, under current cryptographic assumptions, would have no adverse effect, thus not being confiscatory. This method allows users to engage with the new scheme without the immediate concern of community decisions regarding the freezing of key path spending, alleviating fears of being prematurely penalized for poor key management. The implication here is significant as it offers a pathway for innovation in Bitcoinâ€™s protocol, ensuring user confidence remains intact while navigating market value uncertainties and the broader implications of adopting new cryptographic measures.</summary>
