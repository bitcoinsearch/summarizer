    <summary>Matt Corallo brings forth a proposition aimed at addressing the sequencing dilemma associated with Bitcoin's development, specifically in the context of tapscript and script path enhancements. He introduces the concept of a Post-Consensus Quantum (PCQ) scheme as a novel approach to mitigate concerns surrounding the introduction of new cryptographic measures within the Bitcoin protocol. This scheme entails the potential implementation of a soft fork that could disable one or more Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) points, which, according to current cryptographic standards, would have negligible impact on the network's operational integrity. This initiative is posited as non-confiscatory, given its minimal effect under prevailing cryptographic assumptions, thereby offering a safeguard for users against the unilateral freezing of key path spending by community consensus.

Corallo's proposal aims to alleviate user concerns related to the adoption of this new scheme, particularly regarding the market value of their coins and the fear of being unfairly penalized for what might be perceived as poor key management. By integrating this mechanism, users would not have to fret over the possibility of their assets being the first or subsequent targets in the event of policy shifts within the community. This approach seeks to harmonize technological advancement with user assurance, ensuring that advancements like the PCQ scheme can be adopted without immediate backlash or fear of adverse implications on asset security and value.</summary>
