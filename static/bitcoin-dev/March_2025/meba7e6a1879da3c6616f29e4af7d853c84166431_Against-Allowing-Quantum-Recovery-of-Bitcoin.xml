    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>In an intriguing discussion about advancing Bitcoin's script capabilities, a solution has been proposed to address the sequencing dilemma associated with tapscript (script path) enhancements. This involves the introduction of a first Partially Constrained Quantum (PCQ) scheme specifically designed for tapscript applications. The essence of this scheme is to enable a more flexible and secure approach to script execution without imposing undue restrictions or complexities on users.

A notable aspect of this proposal is the consideration of a soft fork that could selectively disable one or more Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) points. These NUMS points are currently non-intrusive under prevailing cryptographic standards, meaning their deactivation would not infringe upon existing security assumptions or lead to asset confiscation concerns. This strategic move is aimed at ensuring participants can engage with the new scheme confidently, without fretting over potential community decisions regarding the freezing of key path spending mechanisms in future scenarios.

The underlying motivation for these advancements is to mitigate user anxieties related to market value fluctuations and the inherent risks of being perceived as negligent in key management practices. By preemptively addressing these issues, the initiative seeks to cultivate a conducive environment for adoption and utilization of the enhanced script functionalities, thereby fostering trust and stability within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
