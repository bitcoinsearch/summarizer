    <summary>The introduction of Testnet4 was aimed at overcoming the challenges faced by its predecessor, Testnet3, particularly the issue with difficulty reset that caused significant disruptions. Despite these intentions, Testnet4 replicated a similar rule regarding difficulty reset, leading to comparable problems. This situation highlights a fundamental challenge in balancing the desire for a permissionless network, characteristic of Proof of Work (PoW) systems, against the need for a controlled testing environment, as seen with Signet. The intention behind allowing difficulty resets was to enable developers to mine blocks on their laptops, facilitating a more accessible and flexible development process. However, this approach inadvertently created opportunities for exploitation, undermining the objectives of Testnet4. Specifically, it failed to accurately replicate the Bitcoin mainnet's conditions while also falling short of providing an effective platform for developers to test block mining on personal computing devices.

To address these shortcomings, a proposal has been put forward to eliminate the difficulty reset rule from Testnet4 through a flag day hard fork scheduled for January 1, 2026. This proposed solution aims to strike a balance between maintaining the network's integrity and minimizing potential disruptions to the ongoing development and testing processes. The chosen date allows ample time for the necessary technical review, integration into the next major release of Bitcoin Core, backporting to earlier versions, and adoption across the infrastructure reliant on Testnet4. This timeline is designed to ensure that the transition can occur smoothly, without compromising the functionality or reliability of the test network.</summary>
