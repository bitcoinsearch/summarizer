    <title>Consensus Cleanup BIP draft</title>

    <summary>Antoine engages in the ongoing debate regarding the invalidation of 64 bytes transactions, emphasizing his stance and rationale behind supporting this change. He references a detailed summary he previously provided which encapsulates arguments from both sides of the discussion, available at [delvingbitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710/41). Antoine acknowledges an error made in citing caching as a motivation for this proposal, crediting Eric for correcting this misunderstanding. However, he reaffirms that the primary intent has always been to mitigate risks associated with Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) verifiers, aligning with Matt's original proposal documented at [GitHub](https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/7f9670b643b7c943a0cc6d2197d3eabe661050c2/bip-XXXX.mediawiki).

He further elaborates on the broader application of SPV verifiers beyond just SPV wallets, underscoring the necessity of addressing the vulnerabilities introduced by 64 bytes transactions. While Antoine admits the solution's imperfection, noting the "ugliness" of introducing such discontinuity, he reasons that its implementation is a lesser evil compared to leaving the identified weakness unaddressed. Despite his current support for including this fix in the BIP, Antoine expresses openness to revisiting his stance if presented with compelling counterarguments or new data that may challenge the proposed amendment's efficacy or necessity.</summary>
