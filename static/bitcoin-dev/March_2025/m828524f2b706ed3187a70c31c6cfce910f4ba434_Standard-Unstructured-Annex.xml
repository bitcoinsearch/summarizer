    <summary>In the evolving landscape of data encoding within blockchain technologies, a consensus is emerging that will likely favor a tag-length-value (TLV) encoding scheme for annex data. This development suggests that any encoding starting with a non-zero byte will be deemed compatible once consensus is achieved. This shift will necessitate that applications currently utilizing annexes to upgrade their encoding schemes to align with new consensus features. The adaptation process is viewed positively, as it signifies progress towards standardization and enhanced functionality.

Libre Relay's approach to OP_Return output size, which imposes no limitations, reflects a broader reluctance to restrict annex usage unnecessarily. Instead, an opt-in requirement is deemed sufficient to manage participation. This policy acknowledges potential risks, such as the theoretical possibility of a pinning attack within multi-party, annex-using protocols. Such attacks would involve re-signing transactions with enlarged annexes. However, the proposed solution to this issue involves integrating witness-RBF (Replace-By-Fee) with replace-by-fee-rate mechanisms, offering a robust defense against potential exploits. This proactive stance is underpinned by the current absence of protocols susceptible to these attacks, allowing for future solutions to be developed as necessary.
