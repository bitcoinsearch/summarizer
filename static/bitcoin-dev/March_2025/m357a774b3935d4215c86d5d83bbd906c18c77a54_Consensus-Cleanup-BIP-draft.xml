    <summary>In a recent discussion on the technical aspects of Bitcoin transactions, an interesting point was brought up regarding the size and malleability of transactions within the network. It was highlighted that certain 64 byte transactions are immutable in terms of their size due to specific conditions. This immutability is attributed to the use of SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY flags in the transaction's signature. These flags are crucial in scenarios such as smart contracting systems where burn-all or giveaway-all clauses are implemented. In these cases, if a transaction unintentionally ends up being 64 bytes, it remains recoverable due to the flexibility allowed by these flags.

However, the conversation took a deeper dive into the implications of using different signature hash types, specifically pointing out the limitations associated with SIGHASH_ALL. Transactions signed with SIGHASH_ALL lack the malleability of those signed with SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, meaning they could potentially get stuck in the event of an error, unable to be confirmed or modified on the network.

Further exploration into opcode OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (OP_CTV) reveals another layer of complexity. Even transactions that are flexible under the SIGHASH_SINGLE | SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY regime could face immutability once they are embedded within a CTV tree. This detail underscores the nuanced nature of transaction handling in Bitcoinâ€™s protocol, particularly how the choice of signature hashing method can significantly impact the transaction's ability to be adjusted post-creation.

For those interested in delving into the technical specifics of this discussion, more information can be found through the Stack Exchange platform, which provides a comprehensive example illustrating these points.
