    <summary>The recent developments around BIP3 have marked a significant milestone with its merge as Draft on February 20th, followed by a minor update thereafter. The absence of feedback or input for over three weeks suggests a consensus among the stakeholders that the proposal might be in its final stages and ready for broader adoption. It is proposed that BIP3 be advanced to the status of Proposed, as indicated by the link provided ([https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1794](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1794)). The call for further review comments, suggestions, or concerns is open, inviting stakeholders to share their thoughts either directly through the provided link, by email, or other communication channels associated with the Bitcoin Development Mailing List group. This step signifies a crucial phase in the development and potential implementation of BIP3 within the Bitcoin protocol, reflecting a collective move towards refining and enhancing the system based on collaborative feedback and contributions from the community.</summary>
