    <summary>The release candidate for Bitcoin Core version v29.0rc2 has been officially made available, marking a significant step towards the launch of a new major version. Interested parties can download the binaries from the provided [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-29.0/test.rc2/) and access the source code via the signed tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v29.0rc2). This iteration is part of the preparatory phase before the final release, aimed at identifying and addressing any critical issues that may surface.

To aid in the evaluation and testing process, preliminary release notes have been shared [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/29.0-Release-Notes-draft), alongside a detailed [testing guide](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/29.0-Release-Candidate-Testing-Guide) to facilitate thorough assessment by developers and testers. The community is encouraged to report any issues or comments directly on the project's GitHub page at this [link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/32052).

Release candidates serve as crucial test versions that precede the final release of software updates. They play an essential role in ensuring the stability and reliability of the forthcoming version. In this case, should the v29.0rc2 pass all tests without revealing any critical problems, it will be tagged as the definitive v29.0 release. This communication underscores the importance of community involvement in refining and enhancing the Bitcoin Core software, reflecting the collaborative effort required to advance this pioneering cryptocurrency platform.</summary>
