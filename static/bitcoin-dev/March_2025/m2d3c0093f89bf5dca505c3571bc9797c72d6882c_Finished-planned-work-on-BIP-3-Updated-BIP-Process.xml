    <summary>Antoine recently reviewed the latest version of BIP3 and believes it appears ready for implementation, inviting feedback from other BIP editors on the subject. In an effort to refine the proposal, he has submitted a pull request (PR) to the BIP repository addressing some minor wording concerns. Furthermore, Antoine has taken the initiative to experiment with the new format by adapting his recent Consensus Cleanup BIP draft to comply with BIP3's guidelines. This adaptation required minimal changes, prompting him to also convert the Miniscript BIP as if it were in its final stage. For those interested in examining the modifications, Antoine has provided a link to the diff on GitHub ([view the diff here](https://github.com/darosior/bips/pull/1)). His message concludes with an indication of support for the current state of the BIP3, signaling this through the term "tested ACK," which suggests that after testing, he acknowledges the proposal's readiness for further consideration or adoption.</summary>
