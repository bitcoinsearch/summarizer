    <summary>Antoine raises a significant point regarding the development and modification of Bitcoin Script, emphasizing the inherent unpredictability and complexity of the current interpreter. He suggests that the conventional approach of making minor amendments to the code may not be as safe or effective as presumed, due to the limited understanding of the script's behavior in various scenarios. Instead, Antoine advocates for the consideration of developing a new, cleaner interpreter. This alternative approach aims to create a system that developers can more logically understand and reason about, potentially offering a more reliable and less risky solution than merely adjusting existing lines of code within the hard-to-predict current framework. This perspective sheds light on the broader challenges faced in the realm of Bitcoin development, where the clarity and predictability of code play crucial roles in ensuring its security and functionality.</summary>
