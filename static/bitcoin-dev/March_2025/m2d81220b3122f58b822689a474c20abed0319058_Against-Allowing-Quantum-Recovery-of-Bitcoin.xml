    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>Agustín expresses strong reservations about allowing quantum computers the ability to access funds from non-upgraded, potentially vulnerable Bitcoin addresses. He challenges Saulo's proposition that a free-market approach should prevail, where unclaimed coins are left for the taking by whoever has the capability—ostensibly those with access to quantum technology. Agustín raises concerns about the broader implications of such a scenario, highlighting the risk it poses not only to Satoshi-era coins but also to active wallets, particularly those belonging to individuals on the so-called "rich list". The potential for significant amounts of Bitcoin to suddenly flood the market is alarming to Agustín, as he foresees a drastic decrease in Bitcoin prices, a subsequent loss of trust in the cryptocurrency, and widespread financial repercussions for the community.

In his argument, Agustín underscores the foundational principle of Bitcoin: "your keys, your coins", emphasizing how the advent of quantum technology threatens this core tenet by enabling unauthorized access to funds if users fail to upgrade their security in time. He advocates for a proactive measure where vulnerable funds are frozen after a grace period, suggesting a four-year window for owners to transition to quantum-resistant addresses. This approach, according to Agustín, not only reinforces the security and integrity of Bitcoin but also encourages users to enhance their personal wallet security, thereby strengthening the entire network against future threats.

Furthermore, Agustín acknowledges the potential complications and controversies that might arise from freezing coins, including confusion among users and the possibility of creating a split within the community akin to the Ethereum Classic situation. However, he maintains that the repercussions of quantum-related thefts would inflict far greater damage on Bitcoin's reputation and its perceived reliability. Drawing parallels with past successful resolutions to network vulnerabilities, such as SegWit, Agustín sees the proposed freeze as a necessary evolution rather than a bailout. He concludes by affirming his preference for preemptively locking vulnerable coins over allowing them to be seized by the entities capable of developing quantum computing solutions, framing this stance as a commitment to preserving Bitcoin's stability and trustworthiness for all users.</summary>
