    <summary>The debate on how to handle the potential threat of quantum computing to Bitcoin addresses that haven't upgraded to be quantum-resistant is a complex one. On one side, there's an argument for a free-market approach where old coins are left vulnerable to being scooped up by quantum computers if their owners don't move them to safer addresses. This idea might seem fair as it leaves things to chance and encourages users to act swiftly to protect their assets. However, the consequences of such an approach could be dire. Quantum computers have the capability to crack keys and access coins, putting not just old, inactive wallets at risk but also those belonging to active users, including those on the so-called rich list. The result could be millions of Bitcoins flooding the market, leading to a significant drop in prices and a loss of trust in Bitcoin. Such a scenario would hurt all stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

On the other hand, the proposal to freeze funds that are vulnerable to quantum attacks offers a way to mitigate these risks. By giving users a heads-up period, say four years, to move their funds to quantum-resistant addresses, the community can protect the core promise of Bitcoin: "your keys, your coins." This approach not only shields users from the theft of their assets by those with advanced quantum technology but also encourages the migration to safer addresses, thereby strengthening Bitcoin's security infrastructure in the long term.

Despite concerns that freezing vulnerable coins could lead to confusion or even a split in the community similar to what happened with Ethereum Classic, it's argued that the fallout from quantum theft would be far more damaging. It would make Bitcoin appear broken beyond repair rather than adhering to strict security measures. A well-communicated plan and sufficient time for migration could help avoid such negative outcomes. Drawing parallels with past successful upgrades like SegWit, this strategy is seen not as a bailout but as a necessary step to preserve Bitcoin's integrity and ensure its longevity. The emphasis here is on proactive measures to maintain confidence in Bitcoin for all users, rather than leaving the network's security to the whims of technological advancements or malicious actors.</summary>
