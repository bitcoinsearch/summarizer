    <summary>Agustín raises concerns about the potential consequences of quantum computers being able to access funds from non-upgraded, vulnerable Bitcoin addresses. He critiques Saulo's free-market approach, which suggests leaving old coins available for the taking if not moved to quantum-resistant addresses, highlighting that such a strategy might initially seem fair but could lead to significant issues. Agustín emphasizes the risk of quantum machines cracking keys and seizing coins, not just those from the Satoshi era but also from active wallets, including those belonging to the wealthiest Bitcoin holders. This scenario could result in millions of bitcoins flooding the market, drastically reducing prices, undermining trust in Bitcoin, and causing widespread negative impacts on all stakeholders.

Agustín proposes an alternative solution to mitigate these risks: freezing the funds in vulnerable addresses after providing a grace period (suggested as four years) for users to upgrade to quantum-resistant addresses. He argues that this approach better preserves the core principle of Bitcoin, "your keys, your coins," by protecting users' assets from being stolen due to their failure to upgrade in time. By encouraging the move to safer addresses, this policy would not only safeguard individual holdings but would also strengthen the overall security and resilience of the Bitcoin network in the face of quantum computing threats.

Furthermore, Agustín addresses potential criticisms of his proposal, acknowledging that freezing funds could lead to confusion or even cause a network split, similar to what happened with Ethereum Classic. However, he counters that the repercussions of allowing quantum theft would be far more detrimental, portraying Bitcoin as broken rather than strictly governed. He believes that a well-communicated plan and sufficient time for users to migrate their funds could alleviate most concerns. Agustín draws on Bitcoin's history of overcoming challenges, such as the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), to argue that the community can successfully navigate this issue without resorting to measures that compromise the integrity of the network. He concludes by advocating for the protection of vulnerable coins through freezing, prioritizing the long-term solidity of Bitcoin over the short-term interests of those who might benefit from quantum technological advancements.</summary>
