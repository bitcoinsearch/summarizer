    <summary>Agustín expresses concerns over the implications of quantum computing on Bitcoin's security, particularly regarding the potential for quantum computers to access funds from addresses that haven't upgraded to quantum-resistant forms. He debates against a laissez-faire attitude suggested by Saulo, which proposes leaving outdated coins accessible for quantum machines to potentially claim. Agustín argues that such an approach could not only risk losing historic Satoshi-era bitcoins but also threaten active wallets, including those holding significant amounts of Bitcoin. He foresees a scenario where the mass acquisition of bitcoins by quantum computers could severely destabilize Bitcoin's value and undermine trust in the cryptocurrency, impacting all users negatively.

To prevent this chaos, Agustín advocates for freezing the funds in vulnerable addresses after providing their owners with a sufficient period, such as four years, to transition to quantum-resistant addresses. This measure aims to protect the core principle of Bitcoin, "your keys, your coins," by preventing quantum technology from exploiting slow adopters. Moreover, Agustín believes that taking proactive steps to secure the network against quantum threats would encourage users to migrate to safer addresses, thereby strengthening Bitcoin's overall security in the long run.

While acknowledging Saulo's concerns that freezing coins could lead to confusion or even cause a split in the community akin to what happened with Ethereum Classic, Agustín contends that the fallout from quantum thefts would be far more damaging to Bitcoin's reputation. He suggests that a well-articulated plan and giving users ample time to upgrade their security could mitigate risks and preserve the integrity of Bitcoin. Drawing parallels with previous successful upgrades like SegWit, Agustín positions his argument as a continuation of Bitcoin's adaptability and resilience rather than an emergency intervention. Through his letter, Agustín emphasizes the importance of collective action and careful planning in safeguarding Bitcoin against emerging technological threats.</summary>
