    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>Agustín expresses concerns over the potential havoc quantum computers could wreak on Bitcoin by cracking keys and accessing funds from addresses that haven't upgraded to be quantum-resistant. He critiques Saulo's laissez-faire perspective, which suggests leaving unupgraded coins as fair game for whoever can access them first, pointing out that such a stance might seem equitable but could lead to significant disruptions. Agustín fears that if quantum technology were used to snatch bitcoins, it would not only threaten the Satoshi-era coins but also put active wallets, especially those holding substantial amounts, at risk. This could result in a massive influx of bitcoins into the market, leading to plummeting prices and eroding trust in the cryptocurrency.

He argues that proactively freezing the funds of vulnerable addresses after giving users ample warning (e.g., a four-year period) to upgrade is a better strategy. This approach aligns with Bitcoin’s core principle of "your keys, your coins" by preventing quantum-enabled theft from undermining user confidence in their control over their assets. By encouraging users to migrate to safer addresses, this policy would not only protect individual holdings but also bolster the overall security and reliability of Bitcoin.

Although he acknowledges Saulo's concerns that freezing coins might confuse users or even precipitate a division within the Bitcoin community akin to the Ethereum Classic split, Agustín believes the alternative—allowing quantum computers to potentially empty wallets—would cast Bitcoin in a far worse light, portraying it as flawed rather than resilient and adaptive. He points to Bitcoin’s history of overcoming challenges, such as the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), to argue that the community can navigate this transition successfully. Ultimately, Agustín advocates for the protection of vulnerable coins to prevent their acquisition by entities with quantum computing capabilities, emphasizing the importance of maintaining Bitcoin's integrity for all users.</summary>
