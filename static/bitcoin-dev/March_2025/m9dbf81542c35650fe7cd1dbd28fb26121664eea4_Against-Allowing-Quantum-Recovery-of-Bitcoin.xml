    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discourse regarding the potential quantum recovery of Bitcoin highlights a critical concern within the cryptocurrency community. The discussion stems from the anticipation that, prior to a direct attack on Bitcoin, other less secure and equally valuable targets such as altcoins, governmental entities, and financial institutions might face breaches. This could serve as a preliminary warning system, providing insight into the vulnerabilities exposed by quantum capabilities. Despite this, the urgency to address quantum threats to Bitcoin remains paramount, especially considering the long lead times necessary for developing and implementing quantum-safe cryptographic solutions. 

There is a broad spectrum of opinions on the timeline for a potential quantum attack, with estimates ranging from 2030 to 2035. This timeframe aligns with mandates from the U.S. Federal Government directing agencies to transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic methods by 2035, underscoring the perceived immediacy of the threat. However, there exists a significant degree of uncertainty, with some perspectives suggesting that a successful quantum attack on Bitcoin could take decades, if it occurs at all. This situation embodies a classic "prepare for the worst, hope for the best" paradigm.

From an asset security standpoint, the implications of quantum attacks on Bitcoin are severe, equating the loss of control over assets whether they are stolen or effectively "burned." In such scenarios, owners might prefer the latter, as it would avoid dilution of the currency and potentially lessen the overall impact on the digital ecosystem. The conversation underlines the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding against quantum vulnerabilities, emphasizing the necessity for a forward-looking approach to ensure the longevity and security of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.</summary>
