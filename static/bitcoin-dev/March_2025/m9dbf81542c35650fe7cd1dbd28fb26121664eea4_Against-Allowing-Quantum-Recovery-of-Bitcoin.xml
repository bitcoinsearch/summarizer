    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discourse surrounding the potential quantum computing threat to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is both timely and critical, considering the evolving landscape of technological advancements. The concern primarily revolves around the possibility that quantum computing could eventually break the cryptographic underpinnings of these digital assets, leading to either the theft or destruction (burning) of coins. This scenario presents a significant risk to asset owners, who would lose control over their holdings irrespective of whether the coins are stolen or intentionally burned to prevent dilution and mitigate systemic risks.

There's an acknowledgment within the community that if a quantum attack were feasible, it might first be signaled by attacks on softer targets, such as alternative cryptocurrencies, government institutions, or financial systems, given their varying levels of vulnerability and value. These preliminary strikes would serve as a warning, offering a crucial window for response before more secure networks like Bitcoin come under direct threat. However, the unpredictable timeline for such an eventuality—estimated by some to occur between 2030 and 2035, with the U.S. Federal government advising a transition to quantum-resistant protocols by 2035—highlights the urgency of preemptive action. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the timing, the principle of preparing for the worst while hoping for the best guides the conversation.

This sense of urgency is compounded by the long lead times necessary for developing and implementing quantum-safe cryptographic standards. Given the considerable debate over when or if a quantum computer will be capable of undermining current cryptographic defenses, there remains a significant degree of uncertainty. Nonetheless, the potential consequences—loss of asset control through either theft or preventive measures—are clear, underscoring the importance of addressing the issue sooner rather than later.</summary>
