    <summary>The discussion revolves around the feasibility and motivation behind allowing addresses to sign with their keys as a proof of life and possession in the context of not participating in an update scheme. The skepticism stems from the observation that ceasing support for vulnerable software and systems is a widespread practice across various platforms. Examples include Bitcoin Core, which offers support for 18 months, Ubuntu's long-term support lasting for 5 years, and Windows providing unpaid support for a similar duration of 5 years. This practice is underlined by the commonality of discontinuing support for outdated or vulnerable systems to encourage updates and maintain security standards. For further information on the end-of-life dates for various software, one can refer to [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/). This message was part of a conversation within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List group, indicating its relevance to individuals interested or involved in cryptocurrency development and maintenance.</summary>
