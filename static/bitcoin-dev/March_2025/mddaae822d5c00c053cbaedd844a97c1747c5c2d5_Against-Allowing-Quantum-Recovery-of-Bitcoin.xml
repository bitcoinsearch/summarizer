    <summary>The discussion revolves around the proposition that addresses should be permitted to engage in activities if they can verify their existence and ownership by signing with their keys, even when not participating in certain update schemes. This idea raises skepticism regarding the motivation and practicality of implementing such a feature, given the common practice across various platforms and software to discontinue support for outdated or vulnerable systems. For instance, Bitcoin Core typically offers support for a period of 18 months, while Ubuntu provides long-term support extending up to five years. Similarly, Windows is known to offer unpaid support for its products for a duration of five years. This approach towards ending support for older software versions is aimed at encouraging users to transition to more secure and updated systems, thereby enhancing overall security and functionality. Further information on the lifecycles of different software can be found at [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date/), which details the support timelines for various technologies and platforms.</summary>
