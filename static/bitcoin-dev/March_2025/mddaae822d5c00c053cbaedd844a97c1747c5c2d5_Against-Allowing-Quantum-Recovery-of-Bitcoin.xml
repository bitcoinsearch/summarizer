    <summary>In discussing the feasibility and motivation behind allowing addresses to sign with their keys as a proof of life and possession without participating in an update scheme, it is acknowledged that while technically possible, there's skepticism regarding the practical motivation for implementing such functionality. The concept of ceasing support for vulnerable software and systems is common across various platforms and technologies. Notably, Bitcoin Core offers support for 18 months, Ubuntu commits to long-term support for up to five years, and Windows extends unpaid support also for a five-year period. This practice underscores the broader industry approach towards managing end-of-life for software and systems to ensure security and efficiency. For more information on software end-of-life dates, you can refer to [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date). This discussion takes place within the context of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, indicating its relevance to those interested in cryptocurrency development and security practices.</summary>
