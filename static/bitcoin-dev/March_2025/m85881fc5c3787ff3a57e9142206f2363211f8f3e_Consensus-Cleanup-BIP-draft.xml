    <summary>Jeremy expresses his disagreement with the suggestion to split his Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) into multiple parts, a topic he addressed two months prior. He argues that such division would be counterproductive by increasing unnecessary discussion and slowing progress on the proposal. He contrasts his BIP, which focuses on Consensus Cleanup and describes its specifications in less than a dozen lines, with other BIPs that contained much more content and thus might have justified being split.

He further explains his decision not to remove any mitigations from the BIP at this stage is based on the extensive research and discussions that have taken place over the past year involving multiple people. This process has given him the confidence to proceed with all proposed mitigations as they stand. Moreover, Jeremy counters the notion that having separate BIPs for each mitigation would simplify the process of potentially dropping one, arguing that it would not, in fact, make such an action any easier.</summary>
