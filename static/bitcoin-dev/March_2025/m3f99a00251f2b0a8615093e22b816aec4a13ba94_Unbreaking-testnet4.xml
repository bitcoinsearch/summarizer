    <summary>The concept of mining blocks on less powerful devices, such as laptops, through CPU usage presents an intriguing approach to decentralizing cryptocurrency mining efforts. By incorporating a simple proof of work, users can potentially earn coins for their contributions. An example script provided illustrates the technical feasibility of this idea: "OP_SIZE 60 OP_LESSTHAN OP_VERIFY 0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798 OP_CHECKSIG". This method stands out due to its network-agnostic nature, meaning it can be applied across various blockchain environments including testnets, mainnet, signet, and regtest.

A related discussion on the topic can be found at [Delving into Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/proof-of-work-based-signet-faucet/937), which further explores the potential benefits and implications of enabling CPU users to participate in mining activities more actively. The proposition also suggests reconsidering the 20-minute rule typical in some contexts, which could significantly alter how mining rewards are distributed among participants, especially those with less computational power. This idea underscores a shift towards more inclusive and accessible mining practices within the cryptocurrency community, aiming to diversify participation beyond those with high-end hardware setups.</summary>
