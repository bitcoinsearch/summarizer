    <summary>The error message in question is from version 0.13.1 of Bitcoin, specifically related to the "bitcoin-util-test.py" file. The traceback indicates that the problem lies within the "bctest.py" file, where a line of code attempting to read output data from a file is causing a FileNotFoundError due to the specified file not being found in the directory. This issue was previously known on the master branch. Users encountering similar issues with the current 0.13.2 release candidate are advised to report it on the Bitcoin GitHub issues page, along with their CentOS version.In a thread on bitcoin-dev, Alice Wonder expressed her hesitation to update to version 0.13.0 of Bitcoin due to failing tests caused by Python errors. She mentioned that these issues were addressed on bitcointalk, but new Python errors arose in version 0.13.1, leading her to abandon the update entirely. When asked for more details about the encountered issues, Alice explained that the main cause was the LANG environment variable and had to set it to "en_US.utf8" before running the test suite for version 0.13.0. However, she noted that this issue was resolved in version 0.13.1. The errors in version 0.13.1 occurred during the execution of the "bitcoin-util-test.py" file, resulting in a traceback error. The error message indicated that the test failed because it couldn't find the file "./test/data/blanktx.json", resulting in an Error 1. Alice also mentioned that she builds in a clean chroot build environment to avoid linking to non-standard libraries and that the LANG environment variable typically doesn't affect software compilation. Despite these challenges, Alice reported that version 0.13.0 worked fine once the LANG variable was set to "en_US.utf8".In a post on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Alice Wonder expressed her frustration with testing errors in Bitcoin Core updates. She nearly decided against updating to version 0.13.0 due to Python errors in the test suite, which were eventually resolved by following instructions on bitcointalk. However, she encountered new Python errors in version 0.13.1 and chose not to update until the test suite functions properly in her CentOS environment. Douglas Roark requested more information about these issues and offered assistance, suggesting that posting an issue on Github would be beneficial.</summary>
