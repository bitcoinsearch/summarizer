    <summary>Jeremy Rubin, a Bitcoin developer, recently expressed his enthusiasm for the potential of capital formation within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, he highlighted the ability for individuals to run their own small companies with shareholders inside of Bitcoin, aligning with the ethos of &quot;be your own bank&quot; that Bitcoin promotes. While this does not necessarily require Consensus-enforced Transaction Outputs (CTV), it does rely on the development of flexible and composable software.Rubin introduced Sapio as a compiler toolchain that enables users to interact with Bitcoin contract outputs through its graphical user interface (GUI) called Sapio Studio. Similar to Solidity in Ethereum and Metamask/web3.js, Sapio provides a means for users to engage with Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities. However, Rubin clarified that Sapio is not comparable to Lightning, the scaling solution for Bitcoin.Curious about the implementation of Sapio, the author of the email wonders if there is a client for Sapio that can be run alongside a Bitcoin full node, akin to how a Lightning node operates. They also question whether the computational requirements, bandwidth usage, and liveness considerations for running Sapio contracts are similar to those of Lightning. To delve deeper into Sapio's functionality, the author suggests exploring the Sapio GitHub repository at https://github.com/sapio-lang/sapio as a recommended starting point.In terms of future plans, Rubin mentions that two more posts will be published, focusing on further dissemination of the ideas behind capital formation in Bitcoin. He invites individuals to share their thoughts on BIP-119 activation, either publicly or privately. Public &quot;soft-signals&quot; can be expressed by editing the appropriate file(s) found at https://utxos.org/signals and submitting a pull request. Alternatively, individuals can publicly comment on the topic and provide Jeremy Rubin with the link to their contribution, allowing him to make the necessary edits.Overall, Rubin's blog post emphasizes the potential for capital formation in Bitcoin and highlights Sapio as a toolchain that enables users to engage with Bitcoin contract outputs. He invites further discussions on BIP-119 activation and encourages individuals to participate in shaping the future of Bitcoin's capital formation capabilities.</summary>
