    <summary>During a conversation with Nic Carter, Jeremy Rubin proposed an interesting concept related to Bitcoin Core that could potentially enhance the accuracy of finality estimates and provide warnings in case of hashrate abandonment. The concept involves setting up Bitcoin Core to gossip headers for work shares. By doing so, the system would have the ability to detect missing work, regardless of whether dishonest miners choose to publish their work on non-tip shares. This feature could be utilized to notify users of sudden hashrate decreases, prompting them to wait longer before accepting payments. It is worth noting that this concept, similar to Bobtail, was presented at Scaling Bitcoin a few years ago. The paper linked above provides more information on the concept, although further context is required to fully understand its relation to Jeremy's discussion. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether this concept has been previously discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
