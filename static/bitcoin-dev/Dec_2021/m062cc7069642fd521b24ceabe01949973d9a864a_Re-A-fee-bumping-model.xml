    <summary>Antoine Riard addresses several technical aspects and considerations regarding the implementation of fee-bumping strategies and the potential impacts on Bitcoin's transaction policy, specifically in the context of the Revault project. He advocates for the use of ancestor feerate over requiring confirmed inputs for Replace-By-Fee (RBF) changes, which is discussed in a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23121). The email outlines the complexities involved in managing delegated coins, highlighting the role of watchtowers that enforce spending policies by broadcasting conflicting transactions with different fee-bumping inputs. This mechanism, while designed to enhance security, introduces challenges related to competition among watchtowers and the potential for "RBF rule-3 pinning," where added fees can be sniped, undermining the fee-bumping process.

Riard delves into the strategic considerations for delegating coin holders, suggesting that the economic incentive to delay one's own watchtower's fee-bump reaction in hopes that another party will cover the fee is outweighed by the value at stake in the contracts being enforced. He also critiques current practices around fee estimation and the management of unconfirmed transactions, arguing for a more sophisticated approach that considers the most up-to-date mempool data without relying solely on fee estimators. The email raises concerns about the reliance on Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) for fee-bumping, pointing out its inefficiencies and advocating for a transition towards transaction sponsorship or "tx malleation" as a more space-efficient and economically viable solution.

Furthermore, Riard discusses the limitations of using ANYPREVOUT (APO) alone for fee bumping, noting the difficulties in managing a fee-bumping UTXO pool and the broader implications for transaction pinning and privacy. He emphasizes the importance of considering game-theoretical aspects and privacy measures to mitigate against potential attacks on transaction privacy and the practicality of certain fee-bumping strategies.

Overall, the email reflects a deep engagement with the technical nuances of Bitcoin transaction policy and the ongoing efforts to refine these mechanisms to ensure security, efficiency, and privacy within the network. It underscores the need for ongoing research, collaboration, and innovation to address the complex challenges posed by Bitcoin's evolving transaction landscape.</summary>
