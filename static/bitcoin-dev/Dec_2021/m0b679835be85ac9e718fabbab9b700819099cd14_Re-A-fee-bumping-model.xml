    <summary>In the realm of blockchain transactions, the assurance of transaction confirmation within a specified deadline cannot be guaranteed with absolute certainty due to the probabilistic nature of network confirmations. The dialogue opens with an exploration into the ramifications of failing to secure a transaction confirmation by a predetermined deadline and introduces the concept of assigning a cost, denoted as X, to such failure scenarios. This cost assessment underpins a strategic approach to managing transaction fees in a manner that seeks to balance the trade-off between minimizing variance and controlling expected costs.

The discourse then delves into a strategy that advocates for incrementally increasing transaction fees as a method to mitigate the expected cost while acknowledging an inherent increase in the probability of transaction failure. This methodology suggests a linear fee increase as a simplistic yet effective mechanism to adjust for potential cost fluctuations without excessively inflating the overall expense incurred by users.

An interesting aspect of this conversation is the consideration of user experience, particularly how the visibility of this process within a user interface might influence user satisfaction. It's highlighted that a quicker success in transaction confirmation could enhance user comfort, despite the knowledge that future attempts may still hold a high likelihood of success. This user-centric perspective underscores the importance of not only optimizing financial and technical parameters but also ensuring that the system's design considers the end-user's perception and response to potential failures.

Furthermore, the narrative references the implementation tactics employed by OpenTimestamps calendars, which adopt a straightforward linear model for managing fees, devoid of complexities such as dynamic adjustments based on mempool conditions. This example serves to illustrate a practical application of the discussed concepts, albeit in a context where the constraints and objectives differ from those of the original scenario.
