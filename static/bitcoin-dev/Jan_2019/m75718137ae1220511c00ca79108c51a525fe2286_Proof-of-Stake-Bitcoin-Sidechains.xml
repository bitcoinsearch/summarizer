    <summary>The concept of "mainstake" as introduced by ZmnSCPxj proposes leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain's Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to weigh voting power, offering an alternative to the self-attesting tokens utilized by blockchains which, according to ZmnSCPxj, present security vulnerabilities. The idea centers around using Bitcoin's UTXOs as stakes for voting purposes within a sidechain network. This approach would require potential stakers from the mainchain (Bitcoin) to demonstrate ownership of a mainchain transaction. Specifically, the output of this transaction must include a sidechain identifier followed by a script that mandates a certain lock-up period ("1 year") verified through OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and then validates the transaction with OP_DROP and OP_CHECKSIG operations in relation to the staker’s public key.

This method allows the sidechain to acknowledge the existence and specifics of the mainchain transaction, subsequently utilizing the output value as a metric to determine the voting power of the stake. Such a mechanism introduces a novel way of integrating Bitcoin’s robust and secure infrastructure into the functionality of sidechains, potentially enhancing their security and decentralization without the need for creating new tokens or relying on less secure attestation methods.</summary>
