    <summary>Good Morning,

In the exploration of cryptographic techniques and their application within blockchain technology, a novel approach is presented for the derivation and verification of signatures that maintain uniqueness for each blockheight. The method proposed involves the utilization of standard hierarchical derivation to generate `R`, a crucial component in the signature process. 

A key aspect of this proposal is the requirement for the staking public key (`staking_pubkey`) to be disclosed to the sidechain network. This disclosure ensures that `staking_pubkey` can be verified as being derived from `P + hash(P || parent_R) * G`. Such a mechanism not only supports the integrity of the cryptographic process but also introduces a layer of security potentially safeguarding against vulnerabilities associated with Taproot.

This communication underscores the ongoing efforts to enhance blockchain security through innovative cryptographic methods. It highlights the importance of transparency and verification in the maintenance of trust and security within blockchain networks.</summary>
