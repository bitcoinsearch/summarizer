    <summary>In a recent Bitcoin-dev mailing list, a user expressed concerns about the hype surrounding the need to upgrade to Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3 immediately. Another user clarified that the bugfix has already been backported to earlier versions and that the announcement on the Bitcoin Core site is clear. However, it is still recommended to upgrade to the latest version to avoid potential issues. Running older versions can lead to network exploitable crashes, which can result in double-spends and long valid forks. The recommendation to upgrade to the latest version comes from the need to protect people from harm.The bug fix for CVE-2018-17144 was released in Bitcoin Core version 0.16.3. This update is highly recommended for all network participants. The patch can also be backported to earlier versions, but the backported versions are still undergoing the Gitian build process and have not been released yet. There has been some hype and hysteria surrounding the immediate upgrade to version 0.16.3, which has been discussed on forums and Reddit. However, efforts to correct this misinformation have not been seen yet.For those who build from source, the fixed versions of the 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, and master branches are available on GitHub. Despite the availability of the bugfix in earlier versions and the option to build from source, the urgency to upgrade to version 0.16.3 has not been addressed adequately, and there is a lack of effort to correct the misinformation being spread on forums and Reddit.</summary>
