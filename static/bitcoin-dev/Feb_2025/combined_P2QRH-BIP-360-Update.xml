    <summary>In the evolving landscape of Bitcoin development, the introduction of BIP-360 represents a significant step towards addressing post-quantum cryptographic concerns. This proposal, initially introduced over six months ago, has undergone substantial revisions, particularly in its choice of algorithms to ensure the quantum resilience of Bitcoin transactions. Initially considering SQIsign due to its post-quantum secure nature, it was later deprecated from the proposal due to its impractical verification time which could introduce DDoS vulnerabilities. The revised draft now prioritizes FALCON for its signature aggregation potential, with SPHINCS+ and CRYSTALS-Dilithium as secondary candidates, aiming to balance security with practicality.

Technical challenges remain, notably in ensuring compatibility with existing Bitcoin infrastructure, such as BIP-32's xpub generation for watch-only wallets and multisig wallet configurations. The current proposal suggests a novel merkle tree configuration for multisig wallets but acknowledges the need for further scrutiny. Additionally, thereâ€™s an ongoing discussion about maintaining FIPS compliance by restricting the selection to NIST-approved algorithms, crucial for the secure deployment of federated L2 treasuries.

Parallel to the efforts on P2QRH, the draft for P2TRH introduces an interim solution aimed at securing Taproot keypath spends against quantum attacks. By hashing public keys, this approach offers added security for various implementations, including MuSig2 Lightning channels and FROST-based MPC vaults, without significantly compromising efficiency. Despite these advancements, the community is called upon to provide further feedback to refine and finalize the proposals.

The conversation around matching the security levels provided by existing standards, like ecdsa, reflects a broader consensus that achieving parity with the scrutiny and resilience demonstrated by current systems may suffice. This perspective informs the ongoing evaluation of security measures necessary to safeguard against quantum computing threats while ensuring the practical viability of the proposed solutions.

As the community continues to deliberate on the optimal path forward, the emphasis on feedback underscores the collaborative effort required to navigate the complex landscape of post-quantum cryptography in Bitcoin. With advocacy for BIP-360 planned across major industry events, the dialogue remains open, inviting contributions that will shape the future of blockchain security.
