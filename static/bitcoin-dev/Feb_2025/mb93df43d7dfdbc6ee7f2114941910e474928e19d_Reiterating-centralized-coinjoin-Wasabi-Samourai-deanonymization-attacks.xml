    <summary>In a recent communication addressed to Peter, Yuval Kogman raises significant concerns regarding Liquisabi's ability to accurately calculate coordinator earnings, pointing out that only estimates are possible and emphasizing the inaccuracy of marketing such services as 'free'. This critique extends to misunderstandings and misleading claims made by Kruw about wabisabi, specifically highlighted in discussions on bitcointalk threads, with Kogman referencing a particular [thread](https://github.com/turbolay/LiquiSabi/blob/ec8db3236cde7378e0240462128369ef04c539e2/LiquiSabi.ApplicationCore/Data/CoinjoinStore.csL66-L76) for further details. Moreover, Kogman discloses his background in developing the joinstr protocol, a coinjoin implementation, and his contributions to wasabi, underlining his expertise and involvement in the field. This information suggests a deep understanding of the technical and ethical aspects of cryptocurrency mechanisms, shedding light on the complexities and challenges faced by developers in ensuring transparency and honesty within the community.</summary>
