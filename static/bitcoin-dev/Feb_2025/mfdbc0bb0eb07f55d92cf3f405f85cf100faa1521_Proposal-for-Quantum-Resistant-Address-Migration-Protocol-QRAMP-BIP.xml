    <summary>Implementing a hard security measure based on specific block height is an innovative approach aimed at enhancing the security of blockchain technology against quantum attacks. This strategy is focused on preemptively protecting the system by mandating a migration of funds to quantum-resistant addresses before the advent of quantum computing capabilities that could potentially break the existing ECDSA cryptography. The design of this security measure includes a migration window, which is carefully determined by considering both the block height and community feedback. This ensures that there is ample time for all stakeholders, including users and service providers, to make the necessary adjustments and migrate to the new, more secure system. This proactive step underscores the importance of staying ahead in security measures in the face of evolving technological threats, particularly from quantum computing.</summary>
