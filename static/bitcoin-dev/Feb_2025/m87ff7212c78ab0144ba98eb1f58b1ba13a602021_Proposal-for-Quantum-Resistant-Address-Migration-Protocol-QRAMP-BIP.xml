    <summary>The proposal in question addresses a significant and proactive measure to safeguard Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats. It suggests a mandatory migration to protect the coin supply, highlighting that not only active but also lost wallets, such as those hypothetically belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto, are at risk. The rationale behind this preemptive strategy is to mitigate the vulnerabilities before a quantum breakthrough occurs, which could lead to the hacking and unauthorized circulation of these coins. This eventuality would disrupt the supply balance and erode the trust and security foundations Bitcoin has established over many years.

The argument against waiting for an actual quantum attack is compelling, emphasizing that such an approach leaves no room for error. By implementing a migration plan now, with sufficient notice, the development of auto-migration tools, and possibly extending deadlines if needed, the community is given a chance to transition smoothly. This strategy ensures the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem by preventing the catastrophic consequences that a reactive stance in the face of a quantum emergency could entail. The proposal, therefore, underlines the importance of taking decisive action well before any quantum threat materializes to maintain the integrity and confidence in Bitcoin's security measures.</summary>
