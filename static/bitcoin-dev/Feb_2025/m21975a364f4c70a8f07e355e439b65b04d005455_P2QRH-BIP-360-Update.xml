    <summary>In a recent discussion on the challenges of transitioning Bitcoin to a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) landscape, significant concerns were raised regarding the suitability of current PQC solutions when applied to Bitcoin. The dialogue emphasizes the complexities and drawbacks encountered with existing technologies, which include issues such as the potential for significantly larger blockchain sizes, increased key dimensions, notably diminished performance rates, and the risk of asset confiscation. These challenges highlight a critical consensus on the urgency of preparing for the integration of quantum-resistant mechanisms into Bitcoin's infrastructure. However, there's a shared agreement that the present PQC solutions may not be fully capable of addressing these needs without compromising Bitcoinâ€™s operational integrity or user experience. This conversation underscores the necessity for innovative advancements in quantum-resistant technologies that can seamlessly align with Bitcoin's unique architectural and security requirements.</summary>
