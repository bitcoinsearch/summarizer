    <summary>In the discourse on enhancing the security of funds in light of quantum computing advancements, a proposition has been made to encourage rather than enforce the migration of funds to quantum-safe addresses. This approach leans on the hypothetical creation of a turnstile mechanism, akin to those previously developed, to facilitate this transition. The focus is particularly on unspent funds in p2pkh addresses which, due to their reliance on hashes, are believed to remain secure against quantum threats. The suggestion emphasizes a voluntary shift for owners of these funds to quantum-safe alternatives, presenting it as a realistic and sound strategy under the assumption that such a migration mechanism exists. 

The conversation also touches upon the vulnerability of pre-p2pkh addresses, which, despite being less commonly used, pose a significant risk in the quantum computing era. The idea proposed counters any measures involving the outright confiscation of funds from these older addresses. Instead, it advocates for a system that allows the owners of at-risk funds an option to voluntarily move their assets to safer addresses. This stance is presented with a clear opposition to any forced lockdown or confiscation of pre-quantum-safe funds, highlighting a belief in the necessity of consensus and the practicality of voluntary migration as a solution to the impending quantum threat.</summary>
