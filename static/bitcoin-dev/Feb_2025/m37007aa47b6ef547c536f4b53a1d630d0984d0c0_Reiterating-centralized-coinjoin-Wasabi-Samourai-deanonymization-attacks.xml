    <summary>The data sourced from [liquisabi.com](https://liquisabi.com/), particularly concerning the coinjoin.kruw.io coordinator, spans from October onwards and is derived from estimation code provided by an individual known as floppy. This code, while open to manipulation, has yet to face significant dispute regarding its accuracy in estimating earnings, implying a tacit acceptance of its validity as seen through archived discussions ([archive 1](https://archive.is/PoyYB), [archive 2](https://archive.is/bpaxH)). It's crucial to note that these estimates are taken at face value without any inherent bias from the coordinator or clients.

Wabisabi coordinators, within this framework, play a pivotal role not in guaranteeing privacy but in enforcing censorship to maintain system integrity. This involves excluding disruptive inputs to ensure operational continuity (liveness) without necessarily safeguarding user privacy directly. Privacy emerges as a beneficial byproduct facilitated by other participants within the coinjoin ecosystem rather than through the explicit design of the coordinator's functions.

The discussion also touches upon the financial aspects of the coordinator's operation, challenging the notion that such services are offered freely and without reliance on trust. The revenue generation for coordinators is not inherently problematic; however, misrepresentations regarding the service's cost-free nature and trustless operation draw criticism. This highlights a need for transparency in how these coordinatorial roles are presented and understood within the cryptocurrency community.</summary>
