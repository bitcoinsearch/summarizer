    <summary>Antoine Riard recently contributed to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, advocating for an increase in the grace period to 7200 in the Consensus Cleanup Delving thread. He argues that this change offers marginal safety benefits while imposing minimal costs, specifically increasing the worst-case block rate from approximately 0.1% to 0.65%. Riard supports his position by highlighting the advantages of mandating nLockTime to be set in coinbase transactions to the height of the block they are included in minus one. This requirement not only enhances the security by preventing duplicate coinbase transactions but also facilitates more efficient retrieval and proof of block height. Feedback from miners, both public and private, suggests that the proposed changes do not significantly increase operational challenges, leading Riard to conclude that erring on the side of safety is preferable in this scenario.</summary>
