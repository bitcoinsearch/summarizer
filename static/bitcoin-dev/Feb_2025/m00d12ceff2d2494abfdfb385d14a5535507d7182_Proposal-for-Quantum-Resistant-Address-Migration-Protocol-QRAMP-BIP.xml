    <summary>The proposal for a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) titled *Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP)* aims to fortify the Bitcoin network against potential quantum computing threats. The core strategy involves a mandatory transition of funds from existing legacy Bitcoin addresses, which rely on ECDSA for security, to new, quantum-resistant addresses. This preemptive move is designed to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing capabilities that could compromise the cryptographic defenses of current addresses.

The QRAMP introduces a firm timeline for this migration to ensure that it occurs within a specified period, countering the dangers of a slow or voluntary transition that might not adequately protect all users. The initiative acknowledges the significant challenges involved, including the non-trivial risk of funds becoming irretrievably locked and the uncertainties surrounding the advent of quantum computing power sufficient to threaten Bitcoin's security. Nevertheless, it argues that these risks are outweighed by the disastrous potential of a successful quantum attack.

Critiques regarding the possible consequences of enforced migration, such as chain splits and the permanence of fund loss, are addressed within the proposal. It outlines measures for backward compatibility, detailed security considerations, a thorough set of test cases, and a comprehensive plan for implementation. This plan encompasses modifications to the script interpreter, updates to wallet software, and the deployment of network monitoring tools to facilitate a smooth transition.

The full details of this proposal have been made available on GitHub for public review and discussion. Interested parties can access the document at [Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) Proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/chucrut/bips/blob/master/bip-xxxxx.md). The author invites feedback and contributions from the development community to refine the proposal further and advance the collective goal of enhancing Bitcoin's resilience in the face of emerging quantum computing technologies.</summary>
