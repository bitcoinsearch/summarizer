    <summary>The proposal centers on the proactive measure of migrating vulnerable pre-P2PKH funds to quantum-safe addresses to safeguard against potential exploitation by quantum adversaries. This initiative is not aimed at restricting access or seizing funds but rather ensuring the long-term security of Bitcoin's network by addressing the shortcomings of current P2PKH addresses. Despite their present security, relying solely on these could render the network susceptible to future quantum attacks. The risk of inaction includes leaving a significant portion of the coin supply vulnerable, particularly coins in lost wallets which could be hacked and re-entered into circulation, posing a catastrophic threat to the network's integrity.

The suggested strategy involves enforcing a deadline for fund migration, providing Bitcoin owners with a definitive timeframe to secure their assets. This approach is designed to offer a clear and unavoidable pathway for users to protect their holdings, emphasizing the necessity of this migration as a preventive step against quantum threats. While alternative methods such as turnstile mechanisms have been evaluated and may hold value under specific circumstances, the emphasis remains on the necessity of a forced migration that includes ample notice and stringent safeguards. This plan aims to ensure the enduring security of Bitcoin by mitigating the looming risk of quantum technological advancements.</summary>
