    <summary>The discourse initiated by Agustin Cruz addresses the significant challenges associated with achieving consensus on a proposal aimed at modifying the cryptocurrency framework, specifically targeting the coin supply related to unused P2PKH addresses. Cruz emphasizes the difficulty in convincing the community to accept such a radical change, which effectively diminishes a portion of the coin supply deemed secure from potential quantum computing threats. He acknowledges the proposal's relevance only under circumstances of a quantum emergency, where an active threat is posed by adversaries capable of extracting private keys from public ones. Under such dire conditions, the community might be more inclined to adopt swift and decisive measures, even if it means considering the affected funds as lost.

In contrast, Cruz expresses skepticism about the community's willingness to endorse the proposal in the absence of an immediate quantum threat. He suggests that, without the pressure of an urgent quantum crisis, there is considerable doubt regarding the community's readiness to support such a significant shift in policy. This perspective underlines the need for a balanced approach to cryptocurrency development, one that carefully weighs the risks of quantum attacks against the current security assumptions and community consensus mechanisms.</summary>
