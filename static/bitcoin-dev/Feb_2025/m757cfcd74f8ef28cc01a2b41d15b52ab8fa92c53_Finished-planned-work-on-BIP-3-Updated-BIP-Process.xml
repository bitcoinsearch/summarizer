    <summary>The process of updating the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) procedure has seen significant progress, as detailed by a developer who has been diligently working on refining the proposal. Initially, the work on the update was carried out privately in a personal repository for several months before transitioning to a more public phase with the opening of a pull request in the official BIPs Repository during early December. Following this initial submission, the proposal underwent two additional rounds of review, culminating in its designation as BIP 3 at the beginning of January.

The developer responsible for these updates has announced the completion of their planned contributions to the proposal. They are now inviting members of the Bitcoin development community to contribute their reviews and feedback. This call to action is not only for those who have followed the proposal's development but also for any interested parties within the community. The developer encourages individuals to share their suggestions, voice any concerns, or highlight issues they believe should be addressed prior to the proposal's merger or activation. Additionally, expressions of support for the proposal on the pull request are welcomed, especially from those who feel positively about it after reviewing the details.

For those interested in examining the proposal and contributing to its refinement, the developer has provided a link to the pull request on GitHub ([view the proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1712)). This effort is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance the BIP process, ensuring that it remains a robust, transparent, and inclusive framework for proposing and implementing improvements to Bitcoin. The engagement and feedback from the Bitcoin Development Mailing List subscribers and broader community will play a crucial role in shaping the future direction of the BIP process.</summary>
