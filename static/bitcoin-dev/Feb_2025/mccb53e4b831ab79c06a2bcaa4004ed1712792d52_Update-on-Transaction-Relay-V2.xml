    <summary>The ongoing efforts to enhance the Bitcoin transaction-relay protocol among full nodes have led to the proposal of two draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). These proposals aim at addressing various issues inherent in the current protocol, which has largely remained unchanged since Bitcoin's inception. The primary motivation for these improvements is to tackle several identified problems that affect the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network.

One significant issue with the current transaction-relay protocol is its vulnerability to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Attackers can exploit the protocol by initiating junk transaction traffic through puppet peers, thus overwhelming the target node’s CPU resources. This form of attack, although not the most critical DoS risk for Bitcoin full nodes, still poses a considerable threat that needs addressing.

Another challenge is the deanonymization vector in transaction propagation. The existing protocol contains gaps that allow mass-connectors to broadcast transactions without sending an INV message first. By directly accepting raw TX messages, Bitcoin core software enables these connectors to bypass relay timers and gain insights into the network’s topology, including identifying the initial broadcast points of specific transactions. This behavior compromises privacy and opens up avenues for targeted analysis and attacks on the network.

Furthermore, the protocol is susceptible to "transaction-relay throughput overflow attacks," particularly affecting Bitcoin contracting protocols such as those used in Lightning Network. These attacks exploit the fee-rate sorting algorithm within the INV message selection process to delay time-sensitive transactions until their timelocks expire. This specific attack vector highlights a practical vulnerability within the system that adversaries can manipulate to disrupt honest transactions between peers.

To address these issues, a key solution proposed involves enforcing strict validation of the transaction message exchange sequence (INV, GETDATA, TX). This approach aims to mitigate the aforementioned problems by ensuring a more secure and reliable transaction relay process. However, implementing such strict validation poses challenges, notably breaking compatibility with wallets and clients that rely on the current, less stringent protocol. To alleviate this concern, one of the draft BIPs suggests introducing a new versioning system for the transaction-relay protocol, which would signal support through a specific service flag in peer-to-peer address messages. Although this doesn’t completely resolve the issue of non-upgraded peers potentially exploiting the protocol, it represents a step towards a more robust system.

The discourse surrounding these proposals is ongoing, with the community seeking feedback and alternative solutions that could circumvent the need for a v2 protocol while still addressing the identified flaws. The evolution of this discussion is crucial for the continued health and functionality of the Bitcoin network, especially as it seeks to bolster its defenses against various forms of attacks and improve overall transaction efficiency.</summary>
