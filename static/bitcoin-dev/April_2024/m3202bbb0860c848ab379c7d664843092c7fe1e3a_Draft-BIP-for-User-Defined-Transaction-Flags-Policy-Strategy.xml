    <summary>The proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by John Carvalho introduces a novel strategy aimed at refining the Bitcoin mempool policy through the implementation of user-defined transaction signals, specifically Do-Not-Replace (DNR) and Replace-by-Fee (RBF). These mechanisms are designed to offer users more control over their transactions while enhancing the network's economic efficiency. The motivation behind this initiative is to augment user autonomy and optimize the network by integrating these signals with Bitcoin's decentralized ethos and its existing economic frameworks.

The specification outlines two primary transaction signals: DNR, which prevents a transaction from being replaced once it has been broadcasted, using a specific bit in the transaction's version field for encoding; and RBF, which allows a transaction to be supplanted by another one with a higher fee, aiming to improve the chances of timely processing during periods of high network congestion. This approach seeks to balance the predictability of transaction handling with the decentralized, incentive-driven nature of Bitcoin's participants.

Three strategic options for evolving Bitcoin's mempool management are considered, with a preference for the user-defined approach. This method relies on creating and adhering to various transaction flags like RBF and DNR to meet transactors' specific needs. Although these flags are not enforceable and can be overridden by miners, they serve as strong hints to improve transaction predictability and network efficiency. The other two strategies discussed include node-defined, which could lead to increased centralization, and miner-defined, simplifying the network but reducing utility for users requiring special transaction handling.

The proposal emphasizes the potential economic implications of these signals, such as improving network throughput and allowing dynamic fee adjustments, which could benefit the transaction fee market and congestion patterns. Specific use cases for DNR include ensuring transaction finality in scenarios like point-of-sale transactions, wage payments, and automated payments for services. Conversely, RBF use cases focus on situations where timing and confirmation speed are paramount, such as high-frequency trading, emergency service payments, bidding in auctions, and dynamic fee management for wallets.

To adopt these new transaction signals, a transition strategy that encourages the rejection of policies leading to mempool fragmentation is suggested, necessitating collaboration among wallet developers, miners, and node operators. The goal is to gather community feedback to ensure broad support and understanding of the benefits and implications of introducing these mechanisms into the Bitcoin protocol.
