    <summary>The discussion begins with acknowledging the initial skepticism shared by many, including the author, regarding the enlargement of committees. The writer shares a personal experience from participating in an open stats board consisting of nine members, which proved to be extremely efficient and practical. This experience has shifted the author's perspective on the matter, leading to a newfound appreciation for larger committees. The primary advantage highlighted is the increased availability of individuals to review applications, which is often identified as a critical bottleneck in processes. The author expresses confidence that expanding the number of committee members is unlikely to lead to significant contention within the group, suggesting that the benefits of having more reviewers outweigh potential drawbacks. This viewpoint adds a practical consideration to the ongoing debate about the optimal size of working groups or committees within such contexts.</summary>
