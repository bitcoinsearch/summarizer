    <summary>Michael Folkson expressed support for Jon Atack and Murch as Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) editors, alongside mentioning Kanzure, Ruben, and Roasbeef as suitable candidates based on his impressions and available information. Folkson highlighted Jon Atack's neutrality and independence, emphasizing that Atack does not align with any factions within the bitcoin community. This characteristic is viewed as beneficial for a BIP editor. Additionally, Atack's history of producing high-quality PR review comments was noted, showcasing his writing skills which, although not a primary requirement for a BIP editor, are considered valuable for evaluating others' contributions. Atack's commitment to Bitcoin and the Bitcoin core, including his lifestyle choice to live in El Salvador to be closer to the Bitcoin movement, was also mentioned. Furthermore, Atack's extensive contributions to Optech, PR Review Club, and his informative articles hosted on [his website](https://jonatack.github.io/articles) were cited as evidence of his dedication and value to the Bitcoin community.

Murch received briefer commentary due to his well-known status within the community, but Folkson concurred with the positive sentiments shared by others. Murch's contributions to Bitcoin and its core development have been diverse and significant, encompassing participation in Optech, StackExchange, and various conference presentations. These activities highlight Murch's ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. Moreover, Murch's comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin ecosystem and deep technical knowledge in several areas were recognized as attributes that complement his broader perspective on Bitcoin's development and challenges.</summary>
