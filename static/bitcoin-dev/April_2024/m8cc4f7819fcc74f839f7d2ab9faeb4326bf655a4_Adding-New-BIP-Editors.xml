    <summary>Raising caution against the choice of Kanzure for a certain role or project is advised due to statements he made on his public Twitter account. He expressed a sentiment that suggests he might prioritize other interests or activities over commitments, as evidenced by his claim of having "better things to do." This viewpoint, directly sourced from his Twitter thread, can be found at [this link](https://x.com/kanzure/status/1766888650069967053). The concern stems from apprehensions that selecting Kanzure, despite the confidence many may have in his capabilities, could result in less than fruitful outcomes if his stance remains unchanged. This perspective invites a careful consideration of Kanzure's current attitude and its potential impact on his involvement and effectiveness in any given role or project.</summary>
