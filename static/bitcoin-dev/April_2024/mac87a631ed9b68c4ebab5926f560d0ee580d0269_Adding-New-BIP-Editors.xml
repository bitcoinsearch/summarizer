    <summary>Ali Sherief raises concerns about the method of selecting personnel through public objections, noting its potential to cause harm both to the individual being objected to and to the overall working environment. He suggests that a more effective approach would focus on assessing whether individuals are demonstrably contributing useful work. This method could involve adjusting their permissions based on their performance rather than public opinion.

Furthermore, Sherief recommends conducting a review in six months to evaluate the effectiveness of editors and processes, suggesting this could help identify areas for improvement. He proposes making such reviews a regular event, possibly annually, drawing on his experience with the Debian Technical Committee. In that context, addressing issues of inactivity and the need for renewal was partly achieved by implementing a policy that required the longest-serving member to step down each year, encouraging the introduction of new members.

Sherief emphasizes the importance of focusing on tangible results over debating the optimal process. This perspective underlines the value of practical outcomes and adjustments based on performance and contribution, rather than solely on procedural or theoretical discussions.</summary>
