    <summary>On March 1, a new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) was proposed, tentatively assigned number 75 and titled &quot;Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption&quot;. The proposal suggests adding optional fields to the BIP70 paymentDetails message. These fields include subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. James MacWhyte believes that these extensions should be included in the new BIP as a general modernization of BIP70. However, Andreas Schildbach disagrees and argues that these extensions should go to separate BIPs since they are unrelated to secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication.Justin Newton is open to either leaving the extensions in or creating a separate BIP. In response to the fee part of BIP75, Schildbach proposes declaring an absolute amount that the payee is willing to cover instead of letting the payee define a fee rate. He suggests deducting the amount from the BIP70 payment message and displaying only the exceeding amount if it exceeds existing fee policies to avoid disputes. The discussion continues on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.There is a general issue with the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process regarding multiple orthogonal &quot;sub-BIPs&quot;. For example, BIP32 faces this issue where HD wallets implement the derivation part but not the hierarchy part. While splitting BIP32 into two BIPs without content changes was declined, there is no harm in using a BIP for a small thing, and BIP numbers are infinite. James MacWhyte's proposal for BIP75 has been tentatively assigned number 75 and changed the title to be more accurate. Some optional fields have been added to the BIP70 paymentDetails message, including subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. These extensions clarify the fee and are not related to secure and authenticated bi-directional BIP70 communication. Andreas Schildbach believes that these extensions should go to separate BIPs to avoid polluting the original idea of BIP75. James MacWhyte, on the other hand, sees BIP75 as a general modernization of BIP70 and believes it is acceptable to include these extensions in the new BIP.In summary, a new version of BIP has been proposed, tentatively assigned number 75, and titled &quot;Out of Band Address Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption&quot;. The proposal suggests adding optional fields to the paymentDetails message, including subtractable fee, fee per kb, and replace by fee. There are differing opinions on whether these extensions should be included in the new BIP or placed in separate BIPs. The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process has encountered issues with multiple sub-BIPs, and there are ongoing discussions regarding the best approach for BIP75.</summary>
