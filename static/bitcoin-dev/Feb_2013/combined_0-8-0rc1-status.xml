    <summary>The author conducted test builds on FreeBSD using gcc and clang to build both the qt gui and command line daemon. The tests ran smoothly without any reported problems, with the author making necessary changes to include directory statements. In response to Gavin Andresen's suggestion to pull #2286 before the final release or rc2, Pieter Wuille suggests that #2243 should fix the non-determinism problem in Windows. This discussion took place on the Bitcoin-development mailing list.On February 9, 2013, Gavin Andresen discussed the need to address a non-determinism problem with Windows before the final release or rc2. He proposed pulling #2286 and creating a patch to resolve the issue. Pieter Wuille responded, expressing his belief that #2243 would solve the problem. No further details are provided regarding this conversation.In terms of the builds, the Linux builds of version 0.8.0rc1 are in good shape and can easily be reproduced using gitian. However, the Windows builds are experiencing variations with each compile and require further attention. As for the OSX build, it is in fairly good condition but still needs some work. Moving forward, the plan is to announce the release of 0.8.0rc1 with the existing binaries to facilitate more testing. Additionally, there is encouragement to perform a build check on FreeBSD 8.3 (using gcc) and 9.1 (using clang/llvm). While the author intends to test version 8.x as well, it may not be feasible within the given timeframe.On Friday, February 8, 2013, Gavin Andresen addressed the issue of varying Windows builds with each compile. He identified that the -frandom-seed flag was not being passed down into the leveldb build, resulting in two different binaries that only differed in the names of some leveldb objects. He proposed a straightforward makefile fix. Luke responded, stating that this issue had already been mostly resolved in pull #2243, which was submitted nine days earlier. However, he mentioned that whether DEBUGFLAGS should be propagated to LevelDB or not is a separate discussion.In summary, the Linux builds of version 0.8.0rc1 are easily reproducible using gitian, while the Windows builds exhibit variations due to the absence of the -frandom-seed flag in the leveldb build. The OSX build requires a pull request to compile. The plan is to announce 0.8.0rc1 with the current binaries and conduct further testing before the final release. A patch will be created to address the non-determinism issue in Windows prior to the final release or rc2. Gavin Andresen intends to sign the windows setup.exe and send out an rc1 announcement the following day.</summary>
