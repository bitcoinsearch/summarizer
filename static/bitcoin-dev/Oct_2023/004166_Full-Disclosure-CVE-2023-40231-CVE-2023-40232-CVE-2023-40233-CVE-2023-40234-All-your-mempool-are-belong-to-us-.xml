    <summary>The email from Peter Todd discusses the use of anchor outputs to address issues with edge cases and the fee-inflation attack. By removing the pre-set feerate, the broadcaster can choose which transaction to broadcast without reintroducing these issues. However, Todd expresses skepticism about using multiple pre-signed transactions due to the potential for increased fee overhead and the difficulty in keeping track of different variants across granular feerates. He believes that this is a policy bug that should be fixed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer rather than in the lightning world.</summary>
