    <summary>The email discusses the inclusion of Ordinals and Inscriptions in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It mentions that while some people may view this as an improvement, it is yet to be determined if Ordinals deserve a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). The sender suggests that instead of trying to force a retraction, if there are valid reasons why this shouldn't be a BIP, they should be formally laid out and rejected as part of the process. Otherwise, the proposal should go through the normal process and be accepted. The sender emphasizes that leaving it in limbo and hoping it goes away is not a solution. The email concludes with a thank you from Ryan Breen.</summary>
