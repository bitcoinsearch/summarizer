    <summary>The email discusses the importance of ensuring that all splice implementations follow a certain protocol to avoid risks when performing batched splicing. The sender emphasizes that if an implementation decides to perform another splice when a prior splice is not confirming, it will self-resolve once any subsequent splice is confirmed. This implies that as long as all splice implementations adhere to this protocol, there should not be any major issues.</summary>
