It is implied that the current level of understanding may be insufficient and that a more detailed explanation is necessary to grasp the exploit fully. However, the specific details of the exploit or any potential solutions are not mentioned in the given context.

It is worth noting that the email does not provide any links or external references related to the topic being discussed.</summary>
