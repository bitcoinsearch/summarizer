    <summary>In the email, the sender expresses uncertainty about whether a certain problem has been resolved. They mention that while many nodes may already be implementing a solution similar to the one discussed, it is not enough for the problem to be considered fixed if the victim of the issue has to spend significantly more than the prevailing mempool fees and potentially lose a large portion of their HTLC value. The sender's tone suggests a sense of skepticism or doubt about the effectiveness of the current approach being taken.</summary>
