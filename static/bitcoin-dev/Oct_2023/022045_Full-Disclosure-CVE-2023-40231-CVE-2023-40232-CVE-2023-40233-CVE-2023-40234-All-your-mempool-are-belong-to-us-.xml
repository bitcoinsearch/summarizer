    <summary>Peter Todd discusses the use of anchor outputs as a solution to certain issues with pre-set feerates. By allowing the broadcaster to choose which transaction to broadcast, the use of pre-signed transactions can avoid reintroducing these issues. However, Todd expresses skepticism about using multiple pre-signed transactions due to potential fee overhead and difficulties in keeping track of variants across different feerates. He emphasizes that this is a policy bug that should be addressed at the policy/Bitcoin Core layer, rather than within the lightning world. Todd believes that fixing this issue in the policy domain may be resource-intensive but necessary.</summary>
