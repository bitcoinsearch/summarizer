    <summary>The email discusses two main ways of spending an "offered" HTLC txout. The first option involves a presigned multisig covenant transaction that pays to the offerer, also known as the HTLC-timeout transaction. This option can only be spent by the offerer since they hold the presigned covenant. The second option requires a preimage and the receiver's signature, and can only be spent by the receiver.

To understand the exact script used for these options, a link is provided to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.mdoffered-htlc-outputs.

In summary, the email explains the two methods of spending an "offered" HTLC txout and provides a link to the specific script used for reference.</summary>
