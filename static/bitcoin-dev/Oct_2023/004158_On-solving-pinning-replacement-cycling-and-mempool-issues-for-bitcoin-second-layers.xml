    <summary>The email discusses the issue of finding a sustainable fix for the Lightning Network, specifically addressing pinnings and replacement cycling attacks, as well as other mempool issues. The sender suggests that by allocating research time, they can come up with a strong solution to these problems. They mention their previous studies on cross-layer issues related to Bitcoin Core and rust-lightning codebases, as well as landmark research in this area.

The sender mentions Gleb Naumenko as a potential collaborator, stating that they have not yet discussed the issue with him, but believe he would be enthusiastic to contribute research time if he is not too busy with Erlay in core. They also mention the possibility of involving Elichai Turkel to verify the mathematics of proposed fixes and the risk models.

One advantage of finding long-term sustainable fixes is the potential to lower the fee-bumping reserve value and the number of UTXOs that lightning users have to continuously lock. The sender provides a link to an issue regarding coordinated security issues handling in the Lightning Network ecosystem.

While the sender acknowledges that they do not have a strong solution design, code, conceptual draft, or paper ready at the moment, they emphasize the need for careful consideration of game theory and node network processing resources. They highlight the importance of following the open and responsible process currently in place within the Bitcoin community.

The sender anticipates that this process will take reasonable time, similar to the discussions and implementation phases of package relay design, which started in 2018 and are now progressing to the review phase. They express their willingness to collaborate with the younger generation of Lightning Network developers during this transition period.

In conclusion, the sender seeks thoughts and input from the Bitcoin and Lightning development protocols community on the proposed research and solutions. They end the email with a quote from Thucydides about facing calamity without wincing and offering energetic resistance.</summary>
