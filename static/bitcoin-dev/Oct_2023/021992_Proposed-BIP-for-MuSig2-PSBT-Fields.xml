    <summary>In an email sent by Anthony Towns, he mentions that this is the first time he has heard of something and it wasn't something he considered adding to the BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). His main goal was to be able to use BIP 327. However, he acknowledges that a future BIP could specify how to use adaptor signatures and have additional PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) fields for it. He believes that these additions wouldn't conflict with the proposed fields in his BIP.Anthony also admits that he doesn't know enough about the topic to provide detailed insights on how such fields would work. Additionally, he mentions that he has been making some minor fixes throughout the day and plans to take the suggestion for using tables. He expresses frustration with Mediawiki tables, stating that they are the bane of his existence.Please note that the farewell part of the email has been excluded from this summary.</summary>
