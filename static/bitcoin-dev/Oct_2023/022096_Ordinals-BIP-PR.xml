    <summary>The email discusses the use of mathematical functions, such as SHA256() or Pubkey(), as an easy way to handle certain tasks. However, the author finds this approach to be silly and questions the purpose of using numbers if they are not memorable. They suggest that it might be better to allow people to publish ideas on their own web pages and come up with names for those ideas on a case-by-case basis.

The author argues that a functioning BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) system is inherently centralized and requires human gatekeepers to apply standards and approve BIPs. They believe that this centralization cannot be avoided if a BIP system is desired.

In summary, the author raises concerns about the use of mathematical functions for certain tasks and questions the purpose of using numbers. They propose an alternative approach of allowing individuals to publish ideas on their own web pages. Additionally, they discuss the centralized nature of the BIP system and the involvement of human gatekeepers in approving BIPs.</summary>
