    <summary>We would like to announce two recent updates to BIP324, also known as "Version 2 P2P Encrypted Transport Protocol." These updates have made changes that affect both semantics and backwards-compatibility. While we are aware that BIP324 is primarily implemented in Bitcoin Core (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27634), this email serves to inform anyone involved in other implementation efforts.The first update, made through the pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1496, includes multiple small changes. One notable change is the detection of incoming v1 connections based on the first 16 bytes sent, instead of the previous 12 bytes. This improvement enhances accuracy, allowing responders to immediately drop connections that appear to come from the wrong network due to non-matching "network magic" bytes. Additionally, the BIP330 message types have been dropped from the short encodings list in the BIP. The rationale behind this decision is that BIP324 should not aim to predict future protocol improvements.The second update, introduced through the pull request at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1498, brings a backwards-incompatible change. The garbage authentication packet has been merged with the version packet, simplifying the protocol implementation by consolidating states and eliminating the special case of "ignoring the ignore bit." Furthermore, the freedom to choose the contents of the garbage authentication packet has been removed, resulting in easier testing and implementation.In addition to these updates, editorial improvements have been made to BIP324. For the most recent revision of the protocol, please refer to https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki.Best regards,Dhruv, Tim, and Pieter</summary>
