    <title>Ordinals BIP PR</title>

    <summary>The email discusses the concept of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) and their relevance in the Bitcoin software. The sender expresses disagreement with the claim that BIPs are used for too many things, stating that SLIPs (Standardized Library for Altcoin Projects) should be used for altcoin-related matters instead. The suggestion is made to merge BOLTs (Basis of Lightning Technology) into BIPs, although it acknowledges that this would require significant effort and cooperation from the Lightning development community.

The sender proposes the idea of having a third BIP editor, as both themselves and another individual named Kalle have been unable to keep up with the workload. They mention that there are more important pull requests (PRs) that need to be reviewed and potentially merged, highlighting that these take priority over a particular issue called "Ordinals nonsense." It is mentioned that Ordinals may not even be eligible to become a BIP, as it is considered an attack on Bitcoin rather than a proposed improvement.

There is a debate within the PR regarding the relevance of certain clauses in BIP 2, namely whether the proposal must be technically sound, aligned with the Bitcoin philosophy, and represent a net improvement. These issues need to be resolved before the PR can be merged. The sender has already commented on the matter, expressing their own opinions, and emphasizes the importance of addressing these concerns rather than ignoring them. They also express skepticism about helping someone named Casey resolve the issues, as they believe he intends to harm or destroy Bitcoin.</summary>
