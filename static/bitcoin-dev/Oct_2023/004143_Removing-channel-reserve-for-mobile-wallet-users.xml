    <summary>In a recent email, John Carvalho, the CEO of Synonym.to, discusses the removal of the reserve for users in Bitkit. He expresses his realization that the design of the reserve is nonsensical and supports Bastien's suggestion for more practical and user-friendly approaches. Carvalho highlights that the reserve balance has caused customer support issues and confusing user experience (UX), which is already a problem in Lightning. 

The decision to remove the reserve was made due to its current ineffectiveness, as it does not work without it being reduced to the dust limit. Carvalho emphasizes his support for Bastien's proposal, indicating that alternative solutions are needed to address the issues caused by the reserve balance. This suggests that the reserve has been causing inconvenience and challenges for both users and the customer support team.

Carvalho's mention of confusing UX in Lightning implies that there may already be existing usability issues with the platform. By removing the reserve, he hopes to alleviate some of these problems and create a more user-friendly environment. It seems that Carvalho views the reserve as unnecessary and counterproductive, as it has led to customer support issues and a confusing user experience.

Overall, Carvalho's email conveys his support for finding alternative approaches to the reserve system in Bitkit. He recognizes the flaws in the current design and believes that removing the reserve will benefit both users and the overall user experience in Lightning.</summary>
