    <summary>Antoine is reaching out to Bastien to discuss the robustness of secure fee-bumping in multi-party transactions and covenant-enable constructions. He mentions that even with future mechanisms like package relay and nversion=3, he is uncertain if it is sufficient under usual risk models. Antoine provides a test link on GitHub (https://github.com/ariard/bitcoin/commit/19d61fa8cf22a5050b51c4005603f43d72f1efcf) for reference and requests the expertise of individuals who understand both lightning and core mempool to review the situation. He notes that there has been extensive discussion on the design rules of nversion=3, and the test is typically based on the top commit by glozow from October 3, 2023. Antoine concludes the email with a polite farewell.</summary>
