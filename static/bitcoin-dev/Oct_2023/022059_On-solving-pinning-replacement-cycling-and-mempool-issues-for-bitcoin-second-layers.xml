    <summary>Gleb Naumenko and the sender of the email are planning to allocate their research time to find a sustainable fix for the lightning network. They aim to address issues like pinnings, replacement cycling attacks, mempool issues, and force-closure beyond available blockspace. Both individuals have studied these cross-layer issues together in the past and have practical experience with bitcoin core and rust-lightning codebases [0] [1]. They also plan to involve Elichai Turkel to verify the mathematical aspects and risk models of the proposed fixes.The goal of these sustainable fixes is to reduce the fee-bumping reserve value and the number of UTXOs that lightning users need to continuously lock to use the 24/7 payment system. To address security issues in the Lightning Network ecosystem, the sender has reopened an issue on coordinated security issue handling [2].While the sender will focus on solving the above problems at the base-layer, they also plan to stay involved with the younger generation of LN developers for a few months. However, it is important to note that there is no strong solution design, code, conceptual draft, or paper ready yet. The sender emphasizes the need for careful consideration of game theory and changes to nodes network processing resources within the existing open and responsible Bitcoin process.The sender acknowledges that this work will take reasonable time, similar to the package relay design discussions that started in 2018 and are only now reaching the implementation and review phase. They are looking forward to hearing thoughts and feedback from the Bitcoin and Lightning development protocols community [3].In conclusion, Gleb Naumenko and the sender are planning to dedicate their research time to finding sustainable fixes for the lightning network. They have identified several issues and aim to reduce fees and improve the user experience. They are actively seeking input from the Bitcoin and Lightning development community.[0] - https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/772[1] - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-February/002569.html[2] - https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/772[3] - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-February/002569.html</summary>
