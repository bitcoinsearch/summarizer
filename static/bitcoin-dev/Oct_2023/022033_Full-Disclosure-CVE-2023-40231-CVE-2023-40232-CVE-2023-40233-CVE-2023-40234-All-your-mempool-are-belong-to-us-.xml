    <summary>The email discusses the issue of failing to use RBF (Replace-By-Fee) in pre-signed transactions. The sender suggests that the correct approach is to pre-sign multiple different transactions to cover various fee ranges for bumping fees. By increasing the fee by 2x each time, pre-signing 10 different replacement transactions can cover a fee range of 1024x. This approach can be further improved by increasing the multiplier towards the end of the range.

The sender emphasizes that increasing per-tx (temporary) storage and bandwidth costs by ~10x or even ~100x is not a significant concern in the context of a highly scalable protocol like Lightning. They argue that there is no reason for B-&gt;C transactions to get stuck and consider it a major flaw in the Lightning protocol that needs to be addressed. They also suggest applying this fix to other aspects of the Lightning protocol, such as channel opens.
