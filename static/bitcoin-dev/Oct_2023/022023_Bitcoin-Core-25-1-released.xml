This release includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter using the GitHub issue tracker.To upgrade to the latest version, users running older versions should first shut down their current version and wait for it to completely shut down. Then, on Windows, they can run the installer, while on macOS, they can simply copy over the `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` directory. On Linux, they need to copy `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt`. Upgrading from an End of Life (EOL) version is possible but may require additional time for data directory migration. However, old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.Bitcoin Core is extensively tested and supported on Linux systems with the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer. While it should also work on most other Unix-like systems, it is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.The notable changes in this release include parallel compact block downloads, improvements to fee estimation, fixes for bech32 address handling, crash error fix when calling `/deploymentinfo`, bug fixes related to wallet address book migration, descriptors, and invalid scripts migration, as well as various build-related fixes.Other changes include improvements in CI (Continuous Integration) processes, such as pruning dangling images, using podman stop instead of podman kill, and switching to an amd64 container in the "ARM" task.
