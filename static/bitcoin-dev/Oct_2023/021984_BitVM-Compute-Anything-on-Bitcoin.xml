    <summary>BitVM is a computing paradigm that allows for the expression of Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts without making any changes to the network's consensus rules. Instead of executing computations on Bitcoin, they are verified, similar to optimistic rollups. A prover can make a claim that a specific function evaluates to particular inputs and outputs. If this claim is false, the verifier can provide a succinct fraud proof and punish the prover.This mechanism enables the verification of any computable function on Bitcoin. However, committing to a large program in a Taproot address requires significant off-chain computation and communication. The resulting on-chain footprint, though, is minimal. Both parties involved can collaborate to perform complex, stateful off-chain computation without leaving a trace on the blockchain. On-chain execution is only necessary in the event of a dispute.To learn more about BitVM and its capabilities, refer to the official paper: https://bitvm.org/bitvm.pdf</summary>
