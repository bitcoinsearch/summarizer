    <summary>On March 21, 2014, Andreas Schildbach welcomed Chris D'Costa's request for access to post on the dev list. Chris was working on a project called the Meek hardware wallet, which aimed to address the issue of MITM attacks during the transmission of pay-to information over a non-secure transport mechanism. The email also included a promotional message offering a free download of the book "Graph Databases," written by three renowned experts in the field. This book serves as a comprehensive guide to graph databases and their various applications. By requesting access to the dev list, Chris may be seeking feedback and collaboration from the developer community to further enhance the Meek hardware wallet project.</summary>
