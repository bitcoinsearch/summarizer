    <summary>In response to the inquiry, Addy, a crawler operator, explained that the drop in reachable nodes on http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/ was not a technical glitch but rather a result of restarting the crawler for updates. This temporary disconnection from all reachable nodes caused the significant drop in reachable nodes observed on March 25th, between 7:20 pm and 9:35 pm.Addy further clarified that it took approximately 15 minutes or 3 snapshots before the crawler stabilized again after the restart. This suggests that the drop in reachable nodes was a brief disruption in the monitoring system rather than an actual network event affecting the Bitcoin network.In light of this incident, Addy mentioned that they will consider annotating these drops with a note in order to provide transparency and alleviate concerns about similar drops in the future. This annotation would help users of the monitoring system understand that such drops are not indicative of network issues but rather a result of necessary maintenance and updates being performed on the crawler.Overall, Addy's explanation provides clarity on the drop in reachable nodes observed on http://getaddr.bitnodes.io/dashboard/. It highlights that the drop was a temporary disruption caused by restarting the crawler for updates, rather than a network issue impacting the Bitcoin network. By considering annotating these drops with a note, Addy aims to address concerns and ensure transparency in the monitoring system.</summary>
