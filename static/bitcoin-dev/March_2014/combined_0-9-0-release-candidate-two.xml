    <summary>James Hartig, a software engineer at Grooveshark.com, reported that his server was terminated after downloading the Linux tar.gz to his OVH box. The email screenshot he received indicated that he was attacking 88.198.199.140 over port 443. In response, Wladimir expressed doubt that bitcoind would connect to port 443 or &quot;attack&quot; anything and asked if there was anything in debug.log regarding that IP. James is currently trying to convince them that he wasn't attacking anyone so they can re-enable the server.In other news, Gavin Andresen requested users to download and test version 0.9.0rc2 for Bitcoin Core from https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.0/test/. This new release includes upgraded git dependencies, Windows 64-bit build support, Solaris compatibility fixes, and the ability to check the integrity of gitian input source tarballs. The latest Bitcoin release, version 0.9.0, also includes several changes such as tightened transaction rules to prevent relaying and mining of mutated transactions, dropping support for older Macs, and changes to the build system, RPC, command-line options, block-chain handling and storage, wallet, mining, protocol and network, validation, and build system. The GUI has been improved with the addition of payment request support, an options dialog, a send confirmation dialog with transaction fee display, a total balance on the overview page, and the ability for users to choose a data directory. The update also allows for the saving and restoration of window positions, the addition of a vout index to the transaction ID in transaction details, and a network traffic graph in the debug window. Additionally, there is now Coin Control Features and a receive coins workflow that makes the 'Receive' tab into a form to request payments. The update also adds the ability to move initialization/shutdown to a thread, preventing &quot;not responding&quot; messages during startup. A separate bitcoin-cli client has been added, and Linux users can now use the script (contrib/qos/tc.sh) to limit outgoing bandwidth. Finally, Bitcoin has been rebranded as Bitcoin Core.Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0rc2 is a release candidate for a new major version that brings both new features and bug fixes. The binaries are available for download from the Bitcoin website. Users are encouraged to test it and report bugs using the issue tracker on GitHub. If no serious bugs are found, this release candidate will become the final 0.9.0 release. This version includes several changes such as renaming the reference client to Bitcoin Core to reduce confusion between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software, and switching to an autotools-based build system instead of individual (q)makefiles. The Windows 64-bit version of the client has been introduced in this release due to frequent reports of users running out of virtual memory on 32-bit systems during the initial sync. However, release candidate 2 windows binaries are not code-signed, so users are advised to use PGP and SHA256SUMS.asc file to verify their binaries. The minimum requirements for Macs have also changed - a 64-bit-capable CPU running OSX 10.6 or later is now required, dropping support for older Macs. This release contains some fixes for transaction id malleability issues and drops the default fee required to relay transactions across the network to 0.01mBTC per kilobyte. Additionally, the relay fee may be changed with the -minrelaytxfee command-line option, and miners may change the default minimum fee they accept with the -mintxfee command-line option. There have also been several changes to RPC, command line options, block-chain handling and storage, GUI, mining, protocol and network, validation, and miscellaneous improvements. The latest bitcoin release includes a number of new features and enhancements. Among the most notable changes are the addition of a '-regtest' mode, which is similar to testnet but private with instant block generation using the 'setgenerate' RPC. Additionally, a new script called 'linearize.py' has been added to contrib, which creates a bootstrap.dat file. Finally, a separate bitcoin-cli client has also been introduced. A long list of contributors was acknowledged for their contributions to this release.</summary>
