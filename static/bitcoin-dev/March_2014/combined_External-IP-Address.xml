    <summary>In an email conversation, Sam suggests checking X-Client-Update to see if the check-in was logged. He mentions that errors are trapped and the IP address is always displayed in the headers. However, Wladimir replies that the current plan is to phase out centralized external services and instead use peer-based address detection. He provides a link to a Github page for Bitcoin where more information can be found.The author of the message discovered a function called GetMyExternalIP() in net.cpp for a small project and realized that the current method being used needed to be phased out. As a result, they created a website called ip.bitcheck.us which captures the IP, user agent, and time for analysis and sends that information when clients visit the site. The site quickly searches for &quot;Mozilla&quot; in the user agent to redirect browsers that visit there.The information sent includes GET / HTTP/1.1, Host: ip.bitcheck.us, User-Agent: /Satoshi:0.8.6/, Connection: close. On the other hand, the received data includes HTTP/1.1 200 OK, Date: Sun, 16 Mar 2014 05:31:51 GMT, Server: Apache mod_fcgid/2.3.10-dev, X-Powered-By: Satoshi v1.0, X-Client-Update: yes, Content-Length: 9, Connection: close, Content-Type: text/html, and 127.0.0.1.The author explains that errors are trapped so that the IP address will always display, and any error information is contained in the headers.</summary>
