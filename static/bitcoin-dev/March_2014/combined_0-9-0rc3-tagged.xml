    <summary>The official website has released the binaries for the Bitcoin 0.9.0rc3 version and is calling on the community to participate in sanity testing to ensure stability and bug-free operation. The release of the final 0.9.0 version also requires more 'gitian builders', as currently only two builders, Wladimir and the author, have built the rc3 binaries. Users running Linux or OSX are encouraged to contribute by building dependencies on their virtual machines.Users have been advised to begin their gitian builds for the newly tagged version, 0.9.0rc3. This version brings changes to the mining code fee policy, which now aligns with the relay fee policy. Furthermore, a rare crash in the wallet code has been addressed, and minor alterations have been made to the build system, documentation, and GUI. Notably, no message regarding this update has been posted on the mailing list at this time.</summary>
