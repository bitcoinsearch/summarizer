    <summary>On March 8, 2014, Tom Geller raised concern about the Bitcoin wiki being down and requested information on how to report such occurrences. It was later discovered that the wiki was undergoing changes in control and operation. Despite the outage, it was assured that there was nothing to fear as a result of this change.The current status of the Bitcoin wiki, which is normally accessible at https://en.bitcoin.it, is currently down. The cause of this outage remains unknown, and there is no indication of when it will be resolved. Unfortunately, there are no designated communication procedures or specific point persons for reporting issues related to the Bitcoin wiki.However, for individuals seeking assistance with various tasks including articles, marketing, videos, user guides, and books, Tom Geller, a writer and presenter based in Oberlin, Ohio, can be contacted. His contact information can be found on his website at http://www.tomgeller.com.</summary>
