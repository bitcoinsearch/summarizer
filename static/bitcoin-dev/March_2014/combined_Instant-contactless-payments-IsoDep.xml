    <summary>In a June 3, 2014 email exchange, Mike Hearn and Andreas Schildbach discuss the potential use of the IsoDep protocol with NFC tags to authorize Bitcoin transactions on Android devices. The main concern is that the connection may break when the phone is picked up, so fallback options such as HTTPS or Bluetooth may be necessary. One idea suggested is to dispatch different IsoDep applications to different apps, but a challenge arises in avoiding conflicts between apps fighting for access to IsoDep endpoints, as there is currently no mime type or similar concept to prevent this. Another suggestion is to have a NDEF tag trigger the app, which would then initiate an IsoDep protocol. However, Mike expresses uncertainty about whether this is possible using the Android API. The email thread concludes with advertisements for Perforce, a tool that claims to provide hassle-free workflows and faster operations for version control. Additionally, a link to the Bitcoin-development mailing list is included for further information.</summary>
