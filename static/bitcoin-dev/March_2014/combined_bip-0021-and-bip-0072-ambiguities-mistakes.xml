    <summary>On March 6, 2014, Mike Hearn requested a pull request from William regarding QR code escaping. William submitted the pull request and noted that the bitcoin-qt client's behavior should now align better with the recommended practices outlined in the RFC. The de-escaped QR codes resulting from this adjustment are also reportedly more aesthetically pleasing.Although it is unclear what project or codebase this conversation is taking place in, someone has requested a pull request and mentioned that escaping doesn't seem to be necessary, with de-escaped QR codes appearing much nicer. The message references an HTML attachment, but its relation to the conversation remains unclear.The writer of the conversation wants to create a parser for bip-0021 URIs with the new bip-0072 payment parameters, aiming for complete accuracy. They highlight that the internet RFC 3986 governs the general syntax for URIs and suggest that any bitcoin URI scheme should use it instead of the earlier RFCs.However, bip-0021 does not mention RFC 3986, while bip-0072 explicitly refers to RFC 1738, which is obsolete. The old standard requires more escapes than necessary, so updating bip-0072 to refer to RFC 3986 would allow shorter and more readable bitcoin URIs.Another issue is that neither bip describes what to do with international characters. The writer believes that character encoding needs to be defined and suggests that all new URI schemes use UTF-8 as their encoding, as recommended by the RFC. Therefore, they propose adding it into bip-0021.Lastly, the writer notes an error in the bip-0021 BNF grammar, which fails to mention the '&amp;' separator between query elements. The writer seeks clarification on the procedure for correcting these issues and suggests submitting a pull request with the changes.Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the bitcoin-qt client already uses QUrl to parse bitcoin URIs based on RFC 3986, indicating that it may have already implemented these suggestions.</summary>
