    <summary>The CCVS (Community Consensus Voting System) has been proposed to address the challenges faced by the Bitcoin protocol in making controversial changes like the max block size limit. The goal of the CCVS is to allow the general public, miners, companies using Bitcoin, and developers to vote for their preferred BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) in a transparent and difficult-to-manipulate manner.Under the CCVS system, each competing BIP is assigned a unique bitcoin address that is added to each header. Individuals can vote for their preferred BIP by sending 0.0001 BTC to the corresponding address, with each transaction counting as one vote. Mining pools, companies using Bitcoin, and Core maintainers/contributors are granted one confirmed vote each, which is worth 10,000 times a regular vote. Confirmed votes are recorded in a new section of each respective BIP as a public record.However, there are still unresolved questions and concerns regarding the CCVS proposal. These include determining eligibility criteria for companies and websites, verifying voters' identities, preventing manipulation through fake companies, and deciding who administers the voting system. The proposal is still in need of further discussion and refinement.During the conversation, other contentious issues in the technology world, such as DRM, were also discussed. It was noted that disagreements in the tech industry are not always purely technical but can be influenced by political factors. The example of the W3C's debate over including DRM in web standards was cited to highlight this point.There were also concerns raised about the idea of buying "votes" and portraying open standards as a voting process. Some participants disagreed with this approach, arguing that it relies on address reuse and is fundamentally flawed in design. Alternatives were suggested, such as finding ways for people to express their support without spending their bitcoins or using full nodes to weigh their opinions.Overall, the CCVS proposal aims to provide a more transparent and inclusive process for measuring support for BIPs in the Bitcoin community. However, there are still many unresolved issues and differing opinions on how such a system should be implemented. One unresolved issue is node voting, which falls outside the scope of the current proposal but is considered desirable by some to give blockchain-running full nodes the ability to vote with a multiplier.</summary>
