    <summary>There has been a contentious debate within the Bitcoin community regarding Luke-jr's proposed block size BIP. The proposal suggests decreasing the block size, but many users argue that the current block size is already too small and would prefer an increase or no decrease at all. The intention behind the decrease was to slow down blockchain growth, but with the blockchain already exceeding 100 GB, reducing the block size will not make it any smaller or easier to run a full node.Additionally, users point out that ISPs are implementing data and bandwidth caps, making it unlikely for users to start new full nodes regardless of any changes made to the block size. In response to the opposition, Andrew C modified Luke-jr's proposal to begin the increase steps at the current 1 MB limit and calculate increases based on the MTP (Median Time Past) of the activation block. This modified proposal aims to be less controversial while still allowing Bitcoin to scale.One of the main concerns raised against Luke-jr's proposal is the significant decrease in size that would occur if it were activated before 2024. In response to these objections, Andrew C. has come up with a modified version of the proposal. Andrew's modified proposal takes a different approach by starting the increase steps at the current 1,000,000 byte limit, rather than the initial proposal's 300,000 bytes. The time span for each increase remains the same, but now it will be calculated off of the Median Time Past (MTP) of the activation block, instead of following a fixed schedule from a fixed point in time.Despite these modifications, Luke-jr has expressed discontent with Andrew's version. He argues that it fails to address the current block size issues and that it is exclusively a hardfork, rendering the use of BIP 9 deployment unnecessary. Nevertheless, Andrew is hopeful that his modified proposal will be less controversial and will allow for progress towards scaling Bitcoin. The full text of the proposal, along with Andrew's implementation, can be found on Github, as provided in the link.Despite the differing opinions on block size, there is a consensus within the Bitcoin community that the issue needs to be addressed in order to facilitate the scaling of the network.</summary>
