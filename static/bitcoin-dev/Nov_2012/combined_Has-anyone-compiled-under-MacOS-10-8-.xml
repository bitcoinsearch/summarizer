    <summary>The problem of Boost not playing nicely with default build instructions has resurfaced. It appears that there may be a compatibility issue between Boost and the default build instructions, possibly due to a switch to clang++. To address this, a magic incantation needs to be added at the top, possibly related to how qmake is being used. Running qmake like &quot;gmake -spec macx-g++&quot; can generate a real makefile instead of an xcode project. However, this may make gcc stricter than intended.In a related email, Mike Hearn discovered that the issue was caused by using an older version of the Qt SDK with the new MacOS version. Reinstalling Qt resolved the problem for him. However, he also mentioned that he had previously requested assistance in finding a solution, as he was unable to investigate further at the moment. He specifically asked for someone to share a recipe or solution to fix the issue.In summary, there seems to be an issue with Boost and the default build instructions, potentially related to the switch to clang++. The user who raised the concern plans to investigate further but is currently seeking help from others. They are specifically requesting a recipe or solution to fix the problem and encourage anyone with information to reach out.</summary>
