    <summary>Jules Lamur, a student working on developing a mining pool with two colleagues, has expressed concern about the lack of documentation on existing protocol implementations. In an email exchange on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Jules discussed the need to rectify this issue by publishing a specification for the protocol. While Jules' professor suggested publishing an IETF RFC draft for the protocol's specification, Jules believes that a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) would be more appropriate.Upon further investigation, Jules discovered that BIP 40 and BIP 41 were allocated for the wire protocol and mining protocol respectively back in August 2013. However, no progress has been made since then. In light of this, Jules and his colleagues are considering writing a draft for BIP 41 (mining protocol) themselves.In addition to their work on the mining pool, Jules and his colleagues have also been involved in developing extensions for RSK merge mining. As part of this process, they have prepared an internal document with the most up-to-date Straum protocol description. This document can be accessed at the provided link.Overall, Jules Lamur and his colleagues are taking proactive steps to address the lack of documentation in existing protocol implementations. They are considering writing a draft for BIP 41 (mining protocol), while also working on extensions for RSK merge mining. By doing so, they aim to contribute to the development and improvement of the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
