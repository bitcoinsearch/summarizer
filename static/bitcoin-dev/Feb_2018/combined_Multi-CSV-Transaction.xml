    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Praveen Baratam raises a question about the usage of OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) in transactions. He includes an image attachment illustrating multiple CSV endpoints with different conditions at different delays. Praveen is curious to know if this can be accomplished using OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.Daniel Robinson responds to Praveen's query, explaining that it is indeed possible to achieve the desired functionality with Bitcoin Script. By utilizing nested IF statements, different conditions can be enforced in each branch. To demonstrate this, Daniel provides an Ivy script and its corresponding Bitcoin Script. The Ivy script, called MultiCSV, compiles into the Bitcoin Script presented.The MultiCSV contract consists of three clauses: bobSpend, carolSpend, and bothSpend. Each clause has its own specific set of conditions that must be satisfied before unlocking the value. This allows for different conditions to be applied at different delays, as requested by Praveen.Overall, Praveen seeks clarification on the workings of OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY in transactions and whether it can support the usage of multiple CSV endpoints with varying conditions and delays.</summary>
