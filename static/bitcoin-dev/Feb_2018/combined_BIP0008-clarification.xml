    <summary>During a conversation with ZmnSCPxj, Helder Garcia seeks clarification on the signalling and activation process of updates in Bitcoin. ZmnSCPxj explains that even if the 95% signalling threshold is not met during the STARTED state, an update will still be activated once the blockchain height reaches or surpasses the timeout_height. This means that the update will proceed regardless of whether the majority of hash power accepts it.However, ZmnSCPxj highlights that if the update is widely adopted by economic actors, miners who do not comply with the new rules will face consequences. Their blocks are likely to deviate from the updated rules and consequently be rejected by economic actors. In contrast, rational miners, regardless of their small share of hash power, would prefer to build on blocks that strictly adhere to the updated rules. They understand that economic actors will only accept such blocks as valid.The time period between the STARTED and ACTIVE states serves the purpose of allowing miners to upgrade their software. This concession recognizes that deploying new software across the entire network cannot be done safely in a single day.Overall, Helder learns that an update can be activated without reaching the 95% signalling threshold if the blockchain height meets the timeout_height condition. While there may be a risk associated with activating a change without majority acceptance, rational miners who follow the update's rules will prioritize building on blocks accepted by economic actors. The gradual transition from STARTED to ACTIVE provides miners with the necessary time to upgrade their software.</summary>
