    <summary>Damian Williamson expresses his disagreement with any changes to the current MIT license for Bitcoin's software, arguing that altering even a single word could have significant legal consequences. On the other hand, Cory Fields suggests focusing on copyright litigation and trademark dilution concerns while emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin's position. There is a statement from an unknown individual who disapproves of changing open source principles due to personal reasons. They emphasize the need to maintain the integrity of open source and not dilute its core values. The use of open source software follows specific principles that should not be altered according to personal preferences.Several members of the bitcoin-dev mailing list disagree with a proposed change to Bitcoin Core's license terms. They argue that this solution may not effectively address the problem of fork coins using the Bitcoin name and suggest social and marketing-based approaches instead. They also express concerns about the potential legal uncertainty and harm to Bitcoin's philosophy of being free and independent. Additionally, they argue that prohibiting the use of the name Bitcoin would be like prohibiting the use of the word &quot;Linux&quot; in brands based on the Linux kernel.A proposal has been raised to amend the MIT license under which Bitcoin is licensed to limit the use of the Bitcoin name by other projects unless they are fully compatible with the Bitcoin Core blockchain. This is intended to mitigate confusion among users caused by multiple hard forks. However, there are concerns about the enforceability of this amendment and its potential impact on forking older versions of Bitcoin or using existing independent blockchain implementations under the Bitcoin name.Custom open-source licenses can create compliance issues for organizations using software. Deviations from universally-accepted open-source licensing terms can lead to legal complications, necessitating approval from employers before using the software. Therefore, changes to the license may not be viable, regardless of how it is phrased. A suggestion was made to limit cryptocurrencies with the same Proof of Work, but there is opposition due to potential branding attacks.A recent discussion on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list addresses a potential license change that could impact the use of the Bitcoin name as a brand or trademark. Some argue that this change could be seen as an attack on Bitcoin's open source nature and fundamental principles. Others suggest social and marketing-based solutions rather than legal ones to address confusion caused by fork coins using the Bitcoin name. Concerns are raised about legal uncertainty and the impact on forking older versions of Bitcoin or using existing independent blockchain implementations. The challenges of balancing brand protection with free and open source software development are highlighted.The speaker agrees with opposition to changing the license due to branding attacks but suggests limiting cryptocurrencies with the same Proof of Work to ensure the stability and security of Bitcoin.Developers discuss a proposal to alter Bitcoin Core's license terms to limit liability for developers subject to lawsuits. Concerns are raised regarding who would have the right to assert an offensive claim of breached license terms. Some argue that defending against branding attacks should be social and marketing-based rather than relying on courts or governments. Frustration is expressed over ongoing FUD and scammery without an official response. Suggestions include altering the license terms or using trademarks, but there are concerns about legal uncertainty and being unable to mention Bitcoin.The proposed solution to disincentivize fork coins from using the word Bitcoin by altering the license terms is met with criticism. It is argued that a social or marketing-based defense would be more effective since the problem is social and marketing-based. Bitcoin should not rely on courts or governments to defend itself against attacks. Trademarks are suggested as an alternative solution, but there are concerns about legal uncertainty and the impact on forking older versions of Bitcoin or using existing independent blockchain implementations. Being unable to mention Bitcoin is considered excessive, and the license does not affect blockchain data.Bitcoin is facing a branding attack by fork coins, and suggestions to alter the license terms to disincentivize their use of the word Bitcoin are met with criticism.
