    <summary>In the discussion regarding the necessity and implementation of a local replacement cache for transactions, it is argued that such a cache might not be essential. This is because an altruistic entity could provide a caching service for all nodes. The suggestion includes the practice of only broadcasting transactions that meet a minimum fee threshold, allowing for better management of transactions that are more likely to be mined in a timely manner. Furthermore, the implementation of BIP-133 feefilter is cited as another solution that helps in managing transaction broadcasts by setting a fee rate threshold, which nodes communicate to their peers to prevent receiving low-fee transactions.

An analysis was presented, considering a worst-case scenario where an attacker with considerable financial resources—potentially enough to carry out a 51% attack—could affect the network. However, even in this extreme circumstance, the cost of storing the entire replacement database in RAM is estimated to be under $1000. This implies that the potential impact of such an attack may not be as severe as anticipated due to other limiting factors like peer-to-peer (P2P) bandwidth constraints. It is posited that these bandwidth limitations would naturally result in inconsistencies across node mempools, irrespective of whether any form of altruistic transaction broadcasting is implemented.
