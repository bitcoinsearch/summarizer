    <summary>In a recent exchange between programmers, a discussion arose regarding the security concerns associated with the absence of a revoked state broadcast in the Eltoo protocol. One participant named Antoine raised this issue, prompting Johan to inquire about the potential consequences of such a scenario and how an attacker might exploit it. Johan expressed uncertainty about the implications and requested a concrete example to fully grasp the problem presented.

Furthermore, Johan acknowledged the possibility suggested by Antoine but highlighted a concern regarding the management of an exponential increase in the combination of states that could result from the proposed scenario. He questioned the practicality of handling such complexity and sought solutions or methods to address this challenge, indicating a need for efficient strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the growth in state combinations. The conversation reflects a deeper technical investigation into the robustness of the Eltoo protocol against security threats and the search for effective countermeasures to maintain system integrity.</summary>
