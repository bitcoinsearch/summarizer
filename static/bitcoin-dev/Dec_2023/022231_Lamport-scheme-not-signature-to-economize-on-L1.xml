    <summary>In a recent communication, an important correction was made regarding the description of a function related to pre-image problems. The corrected description should refer to a function, denoted as f2_(TX,ECCPUB), which maps 'a valid LAMPPRI' to a tuple that includes both 'an address in the format of ADDRs' and 'a signature in the format of LSIGs.' The previous explanation provided was acknowledged as incorrect and has been retracted with apologies for any confusion it may have caused. The sender also expressed gratitude for the continued interest and promised to provide forthcoming details on the entropy calculations for both scenarios soon. This update emphasizes the importance of precision in technical communications and reflects a commitment to accuracy.</summary>
