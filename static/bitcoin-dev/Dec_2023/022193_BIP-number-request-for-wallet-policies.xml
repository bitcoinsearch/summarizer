    <summary>The development of wallet policies as a standard for hardware signing devices was initiated by Salvatore Ingala roughly eighteen months prior. This standard, which has been adopted by three major hardware signing devices—Ledger, BitBox02, and Jade—is currently in production use. Despite its practical application, the proposal outlining this standard awaits formal recognition within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) repository. Over a year has elapsed since the pull request for a BIP number was submitted, and despite multiple follow-ups, there has yet to be an assignment of a BIP number or feedback from BIP editors.

The slow progress on this matter is a point of concern for those involved, as it impedes the formalization of what is already accepted as an industry standard. The author of the proposal, Antoine Poinsot, is seeking guidance from BIP editors regarding their expectations, hoping to expedite the process. By clearly understanding what is required from them, the contributors can work towards meeting the necessary criteria and gain the official acknowledgment that reflects the standard’s current significance and usage in the industry. 

The lack of communication and guidance from the BIP editors not only stalls the progression of this particular standard but also presents a broader issue related to how improvements and standards within the Bitcoin ecosystem are managed and implemented. It highlights the need for a more responsive and transparent system that could benefit the community by providing clarity and support to those who are actively contributing to the development and standardization of Bitcoin infrastructure.</summary>
