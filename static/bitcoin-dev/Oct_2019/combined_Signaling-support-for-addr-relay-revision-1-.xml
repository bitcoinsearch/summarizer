    <summary>In an email, the author proposes extending BIP-155 with per-link-direction negotiation to address relay in the Bitcoin network. While they don't have a strong opinion, they believe that the per-link variant makes more sense as they cannot imagine a future requirement for opting out completely. The author points out that address relay in the Bitcoin network is under-specified and suggests a solution to decouple address relay considerations from light/full node/block-relay-only.The proposed solution involves making it explicit whether a node promises to participate in address relay by forwarding unsolicited messages and responding to GETADDR. The author presents two ways to implement this: either through the introduction of 2 new service bits or by using per-link-direction negotiation with BIP-155. According to the author, having more flexibility with per-link-direction negotiation is advantageous for the future of the protocol. They mention that some nodes might want to opt-out of address relay for a subset of their links. Therefore, the author suggests extending BIP-155 with per-link-direction negotiation. However, they express interest in hearing the opinion of the community on this matter.To provide further information, the author includes two references in the email for additional reading.</summary>
