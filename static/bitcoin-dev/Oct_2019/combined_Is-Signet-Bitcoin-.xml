    <summary>The recent pull request to add Signet to the BIPs repository has encountered a delay as the maintainer is uncertain about whether Signet should have a BIP at all. The question at hand is whether Signet can be considered Bitcoin or not. While some argue that Signet is Bitcoin and having a BIP would enhance interoperability among various software in the Bitcoin community, others view Signet as "interoperability for how to build good testing for Bitcoin" rather than being Bitcoin itself.The proposal for Signet stems from an issue with the reliability of Testnet, which is commonly utilized for Bitcoin development purposes. In order to tackle this problem and enhance the development environment for Bitcoin, there has been a suggestion to create a more reliable type of testnet. However, the debate revolves around the distinction between Testnet and Signet. Despite neither being completely compatible with the mainnet consensus processes, Testnet is considered Bitcoin while Signet is not. Jon seeks an understanding of the reasoning behind these distinctions.In conclusion, the pull request for Signet in the bips repository has hit a roadblock due to uncertainty regarding its status as a BIP. The maintainer questions whether Signet qualifies as Bitcoin, although proponents argue that it does. They believe that having a BIP for Signet would promote interoperability within the Bitcoin software ecosystem. Feedback on this matter is encouraged and can be provided directly on the pull request or via the bitcoin-dev mailing list.</summary>
