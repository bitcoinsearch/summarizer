    <summary>On June 26th, 2013, Jesus Cea noticed that the "splash" banner of Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.3 displayed "0.8.3-BETA". Pieter explained that this was a normal occurrence and followed the pattern of previous releases until they reached version 1.0. No further details were provided in their email exchange.Gavin Andresen had announced on June 25th, 2013 that Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.3 was now available on SourceForge. Interested users could download it from the provided link. The "splash" banner of this release also showed "0.8.3-BETA". The authenticity of the message was verified through a PGP signature.The main purpose of releasing Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.3 was to address a denial-of-service attack that had the potential to crash nodes. To prevent a memory exhaustion attack, the new release implemented measures to truncate over-size messages. Furthermore, a regression that caused excessive rewriting of the 'peers.dat' file was fixed. Users were encouraged to report any bugs through the issue tracker on GitHub.Peter Todd was acknowledged for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability (CVE-2013-4627) and creating the fix. The software could be downloaded from SourceForge.</summary>
