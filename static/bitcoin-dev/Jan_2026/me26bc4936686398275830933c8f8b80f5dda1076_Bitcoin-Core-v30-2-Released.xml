    <summary>The latest release of Bitcoin Core, version v30.2, is now officially available for download from [Bitcoin Core's website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.2/). This update brings with it a host of new features, various bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. The developers encourage users to report any encountered bugs through the project's GitHub issue tracker, which can be found at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) and further details about the release can be accessed on [Bitcoin Core's announcement page](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).

For those looking to upgrade from an older version of Bitcoin Core, the process involves shutting down the current version completely before proceeding with the installation of v30.2. This may require a few minutes in some cases for the application to fully shut down. Detailed instructions are provided for different operating systems: Windows users should run the installer, macOS users need to copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt`, and Linux users should replace `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt`. It is noted that upgrading from a version that has reached its End Of Life (EOL) is supported but may necessitate additional time if a data directory migration is needed. Moreover, the software continues to support old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core.

Compatibility of Bitcoin Core v30.2 extends across several operating systems, being explicitly tested and supported on Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+. While the software may also run on other Unix-like systems, these environments are not as frequently tested. The use of Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended due to potential compatibility issues.

Significant changes introduced with this release are categorized under various sections including Wallet, IPC, Build, Test, Fuzz, and Documentation. Among these, notable adjustments include fixes to wallet migration failures, enhancements in the build system such as an update to the minimum required Boost version, and modifications aimed at improving the software's test suite and documentation. Specific changes involve corrections to unnamed legacy wallet migration, wallettool functionalities, and GUIX build improvements. Additionally, the documentation has been updated including the OpenBSD Build Guide, and various test and fuzzing aspects have been refined for better stability and performance.

Acknowledgments for this release extend to multiple contributors who played significant roles in its development, including Ava Chow, brunoerg, davidgumberg, fanquake, furszy, Hennadii Stepanov, MarcoFalke, and Ryan Ofsky, among others. These individuals, alongside those who assisted with translations, were instrumental in bringing version v30.2 to fruition.</summary>
