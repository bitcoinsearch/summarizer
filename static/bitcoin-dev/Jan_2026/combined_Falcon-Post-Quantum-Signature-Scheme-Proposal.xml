    <summary>In recent discussions on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there has been a focus on integrating post-quantum cryptographic schemes into Bitcoin to enhance its security against potential quantum computing threats. A technical demonstration highlighted the implementation of the Falcon signature scheme within Bitcoin Core as a soft fork. Falcon is recognized for its smaller public key and signature sizes compared to other candidates, efficient signing and verification times, and the lack of external dependencies, making it a promising lattice-based, post-quantum digital signature scheme. Its integration aims to serve as a benchmark for future considerations of post-quantum cryptography in Bitcoin, especially as Falcon nears FIPS standardization.
The conversation also explored challenges related to transaction scalability and privacy in the era of quantum computing. The concept of batched signing was discussed as a potential solution for efficiently managing larger keys and signatures expected with post-quantum schemes. This approach could improve scalability and fungibility, possibly making privacy-enhancing techniques more economically viable at the base layer of transactions. However, initial investigations into Falcon suggested limitations in supporting batched signing, indicating a need for further exploration of various post-quantum cryptographic schemes.
Significant implementation challenges have been noted with Falcon, particularly due to its reliance on discrete Gaussian sampling and software floating-point arithmetic, which presents potential risks of forgery attacks if not executed correctly. Despite its promise, Falcon offers only a modest improvement in signature and public key sizes over ML-DSA, leading to a decision against its inclusion in upcoming Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). This has spurred interest in alternative methods and further research into Falcon's adaptability to Bitcoin's cryptographic framework.
Signature aggregation, crucial for Schnorr signatures' efficiency in Bitcoin, lacks a direct analogue in post-quantum schemes. This gap points towards Layer 2 Zero-Knowledge rollups as an interim solution to maintain verification efficiency in a post-quantum world. LaBRADOR, a lattice-based SNARK, has been proposed for Bitcoin-oriented ZK rollups to address these challenges, illustrating ongoing efforts to adapt to post-quantum cryptography constraints while aiming to preserve current efficiencies.
The deterministic mode of the Falcon signature scheme has been emphasized for its suitability in Bitcoin, addressing side-channel attack risks through software emulation of floating point operations. However, SPHINCS+, another post-quantum scheme, has been deemed unsuitable for Bitcoin due to significant signature overhead and incompatibility with Trusted Platform Module-based state management systems, highlighting the complexities involved in selecting appropriate post-quantum cryptographic solutions for Bitcoin.
Debates around the compatibility of cryptographic schemes with SNARKs and the necessity of considering SNARK-friendly signature schemes have underlined the broader challenges of transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptographic standards. Questions about the feasibility and practicality of using Quantum Key Distribution and Lattice-Based approaches have been raised, indicating a focused discussion on developing and assessing frameworks that can withstand quantum computing advancements without compromising blockchain scalability and security.
The dialogue has also touched upon the importance of not imposing arbitrary requirements on post-quantum schemes that could hinder the development or integration of efficient and scalable cryptographic solutions within Bitcoin. This includes exploring the potential for adopting multiple post-quantum schemes over time and the critical consideration of operational realities alongside theoretical ideals in cryptographic evolution.
Overall, these discussions reflect a cautious yet proactive approach towards enhancing Bitcoin's security in anticipation of quantum computing developments. They underscore the complexity of integrating new cryptographic technologies into existing systems and highlight the community's commitment to thorough evaluation and innovation in securing Bitcoin against emerging threats.</summary>
