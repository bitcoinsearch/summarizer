    <summary>The integration of the Falcon post-quantum signature scheme into Bitcoin Core, marked as a significant advancement, is introduced through a soft-fork within the classic Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) mode. This initiative aims to serve as a practical reference for potential future adoption of Falcon, particularly as it nears Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) standardization. Details regarding this implementation can be found at a dedicated GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/thisisnotgcsar/bitcoin-falcon)). The selection of Falcon over other post-quantum cryptography (PQC) candidates, such as SPHINCS+ and ML-DSA, is justified by its smaller signature and public key sizes alongside efficient signing and verification times, which are crucial for Bitcoin operations. Falcon's lattice-based design promises resistance against quantum computer attacks, offering an advantage in the emerging era of quantum computing.
Benchmarking results highlight Falcon's efficiency with a comparison to ECDSA, showcasing significantly smaller public key and signature sizes, and a faster verification time which is paramount since Bitcoin primarily relies on verification speed for its transaction validation process. The integration process included incorporating Falcon into the Bitcoin Core codebase, updating the build system to support Falcon, and enabling Falcon verification through a new script verification flag.
Questions have been raised regarding the impact of larger signature sizes on-chain and the exploration of batched signing as a means to mitigate these effects. While Falcon currently does not support batched signing—a feature that could enhance transaction efficiency and privacy—this discussion opens avenues for further research into how PQC schemes might evolve to accommodate such needs. 
Additional commentary from the Bitcoin development community brings attention to Falcon's complexities in implementation, particularly its reliance on discrete Gaussian sampling, which poses challenges for secure and efficient execution. Comparisons with other PQC schemes like SQIsign, which employs isogeny-based cryptography for even smaller signatures and public keys, and XMSS, noted for its readiness and compact signature options albeit with statefulness concerns, underline the diverse landscape of quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions under consideration for Bitcoin's future. Despite Falcon's promising attributes, the call for more extensive research into its adaptability, strengths, and vulnerabilities reflects a cautious approach towards its full-scale integration into Bitcoin, emphasizing the need for a broader evaluation of PQC alternatives to ensure the network's resilience against quantum threats.</summary>
