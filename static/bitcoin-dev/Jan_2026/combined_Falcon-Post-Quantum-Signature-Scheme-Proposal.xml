    <summary>A recent technical demonstration has successfully integrated the Falcon post-quantum signature scheme into Bitcoin Core, implemented as a soft fork within the Pay to Witness Public Key Hash (P2WPKH) mode. This development serves as a practical reference for the potential adoption of Falcon, especially as it nears FIPS standardization. The project, detailed at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/thisisnotgcsar/bitcoin-falcon), presents Falcon as a promising lattice-based, post-quantum digital signature scheme that provides security against quantum computer attacks. Notably, Falcon achieves smaller public key and signature sizes compared to other post-quantum cryptography candidates, alongside efficient signing and verification times without external dependencies.
The integration of Falcon into Bitcoin highlights significant improvements in transaction processing efficiency and post-quantum security. By reducing public key and signature sizes and improving verification times, Falcon addresses critical aspects of Bitcoin transactions. The process involved updating the build system to support Falcon and enabling soft-fork activation through a new script verification flag, underlining the feasibility and benefits of adopting such post-quantum cryptographic algorithms within Bitcoin. This initiative aims to benchmark and guide the Bitcoin community in considering the integration of post-quantum cryptographic solutions like Falcon, as it moves closer to FIPS standardization.
The conversation on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List also explores the challenges of increasing transaction sizes with post-quantum schemes and discusses alternatives like batched signing to manage transactions efficiently in the future. Despite initial investigations indicating Falcon may not support batched signing, this approach is speculated to promote better fungibility and privacy through economic incentives, suggesting a need for further exploration into the capabilities of various post-quantum cryptographic schemes.
Further discussions delve into the implementation challenges of Falcon, particularly its reliance on discrete Gaussian sampling and constant-time floating point arithmetic, which presents a modest improvement over ML-DSA in terms of signature and public key sizes. The decision against including FN-DSA in the upcoming PQ signature opcode BIP, citing the need for more research on Falcon's adaptability, illustrates the ongoing efforts to develop secure and efficient cryptographic standards suitable for the quantum computing era. Alternative cryptographic methods and the significance of signature aggregation in post-quantum cryptography are discussed, highlighting Layer 2 Zero-Knowledge rollups as a potent solution for maintaining efficiency in signature verification processes in the absence of native signature aggregation capabilities.
Mikhail Kudinov's email emphasizes the deterministic mode of the Falcon signature scheme, suitable for Bitcoin due to its mitigation of side-channel attack risks and compatibility with SNARKs, despite performance trade-offs. The limitations of other schemes like SPHINCS+ and the potential of leveraging SNARK-friendly hash functions are mentioned, reflecting the complexity of integrating post-quantum cryptographic solutions with Bitcoin. The conversation around fallback options for the SHRINCS protocol, exploring SPHINCS+ as an alternative, and the cautious stance towards adopting SQIsign, underscores the importance of maturity and thorough vetting before integrating cryptographic innovations.
Finally, the discussion raises questions about the role of SNARK-friendly signature schemes and the viability of STARKs as the only realistic post-quantum SNARK option, given their large proofs. This inquiry into the feasibility of translating STARK or SNARK proofs into on-chain effects, the potential need for an op-code for STARK proofs, and the complexities of current sophisticated scenarios like Glock and BABE, illustrates the challenges in making design decisions for integrating post-quantum cryptography into Bitcoin.</summary>
