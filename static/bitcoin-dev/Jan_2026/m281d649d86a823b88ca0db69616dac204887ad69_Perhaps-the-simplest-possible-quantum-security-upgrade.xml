    <summary>The discussion focuses on the effectiveness of commit/reveal protocols in the context of post-quantum signing schemes and their scalability issues. The sender critiques Erik's proposed solution, pointing out a fundamental flaw where the "anchor tx" does not effectively commit to the reveal transaction (TX). This gap allows a quantum adversary to exploit the system by copying the secret once the reveal TX is visible in the mempool, inverting the public key, and attempting to replace-by-fee (RBF) the reveal TX. The concern raised implies a deeper understanding of the protocol's mechanism might be missing or not fully communicated, as the sender admits to not completely grasping the intended functionality outlined in Erik's code. This interaction underscores the nuanced challenges faced in developing secure cryptographic protocols resilient against quantum computing threats, specifically within the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
