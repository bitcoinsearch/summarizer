    <summary>Exploring the potential of Lattice-Based approaches in cryptographic methods is currently under consideration, suggesting an eventual comprehensive comparison with existing technologies. The dialogue underscores a consensus that while SNARK/STARK compatibility is not deemed essential at present, it could serve as a deciding factor in closely contested scenarios. This perspective stems from the understanding that all pairing-based cryptographic schemes would be rendered obsolete by the advent of quantum computing. However, STARKs hold the promise of being quantum-resistant, offering a glimpse into potentially viable post-quantum solutions. Moreover, the conversation hints at the existence of Lattice-Based schemes that may also contribute to the pool of quantum-resistant cryptographic methods. It's explicitly mentioned that Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) issues are sidelined in this discussion, as they do not directly impact the transition to post-quantum cryptography. This focus indicates a prioritization of developing and assessing cryptographic frameworks that can withstand the challenges posed by quantum computing advancements.</summary>
