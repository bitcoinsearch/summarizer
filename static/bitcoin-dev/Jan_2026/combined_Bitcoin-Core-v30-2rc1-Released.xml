    <summary>The recent announcement of Bitcoin Core version v30.2rc1 marks a significant update, available for download at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.2/test.rc1). This new release encompasses an array of enhancements including fresh features, numerous bug fixes, and performance improvements, alongside updated translations. Users encountering issues are encouraged to utilize the GitHub issue tracker for reporting, accessible via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) or join the mailing list for announcements at [Bitcoin Core announcements](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).
For those upgrading from an older version, it's advised to completely shut down the existing application before initiating the upgrade process. This procedure is applicable across various operating systems, with specific instructions provided for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Notably, even versions of Bitcoin Core that have reached their end of life (EOL) remain upgradable, albeit potentially requiring more time for data directory migration. Additionally, backward compatibility is maintained for older wallet versions.
Bitcoin Core v30.2 boasts compatibility with Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+ operating systems, ensuring broad support for users. While also operable on other Unix-like systems, these environments receive less frequent testing, and the use of Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended.
Key modifications in this release span several areas, including critical fixes to wallet migration failures and wallet creation errors post-walletsdir deletion. Improvements extend to the IPC mechanism, addressing shutdown hangs triggered by Ctrl-C during wait calls. The build system sees updates such as the reduction of allowed exported symbols in guix builds and the elevation of the minimum required Boost version. Test procedures have been refined, notably avoiding hard-coded sleep times in feature_init.py scripts. Documentation has also received updates, including the OpenBSD Build Guide and copyright year extension to 2026.
Despite the comprehensive list of contributors acknowledged for their direct involvement in this release, there appears to be an oversight in recognizing contributions from users who reported and confirmed bugs, particularly affecting the bitcoin-wallet tool. Their significant input seems absent from the credits section, raising questions about the criteria for acknowledgment in contributions such as bug reporting, reviews, and testing.
This latest version reflects a collective effort to enhance the Bitcoin Core experience, demonstrating the project's ongoing commitment to reliability, security, and usability.</summary>
