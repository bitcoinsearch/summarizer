    <summary>In the ongoing discussion on implementation details, a significant study has been highlighted that uncovers a flaw in quantum key distribution (QKD). The study in question is accessible through the IEEE platform and is considered essential for understanding potential vulnerabilities within QKD systems. This information could be pivotal for those involved in secure communication technologies, especially in fields where cryptographic security is paramount. For further reading, the study can be found at [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223709). This discovery underscores the importance of continuous research and evaluation of cryptographic methods to ensure their robustness against emerging threats.</summary>
