    <summary>The Quantum‑Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP) introduces a novel approach to address the challenge of securing legacy Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) against quantum computing threats. The protocol proposes a two-phase commit and spend flow designed to make these UTXOs spendable post-quantum activation while safeguarding them from destination substitution attacks that could occur if a legacy private key is compromised after its associated public key is revealed. The commitment phase mandates the publication of a commitment on-chain, which details the intended spend outputs, including amounts and scriptPubKeys. This commitment must achieve a predefined number of confirmations before it becomes valid. In the subsequent spend phase, a transaction can only be executed if it includes proof that a matching commitment was previously mined and has matured, alongside evidence that the spend's outputs align with the committed template.
A key technical hurdle in implementing QRAMP is ensuring this mechanism operates under consensus without requiring nodes to perform historical transaction lookups, which could exclude nodes that have pruned their storage or do not maintain a transaction index. The proposed solution involves transactions carrying an SPV-style inclusion proof for the commitment, featuring the transaction ID, a merkle branch to a block header, and adhering to a minimum confirmation depth rule. To enhance user experience and address potential issues with fee payment during the initial commitment phase, the protocol allows for fee sponsorship. A receiver, exchange, or service may publish the commitment transaction and cover its fees, while the legacy holder authorizes the commitment off-chain via a signature over the commitment hash.
However, concerns remain regarding the reliance on classical ECDSA signatures during Phase 2 of the transaction process. This requirement exposes the public key, thereby risking compromise of the corresponding private key by a quantum attacker. Such an attacker might not need to intercept live transactions but could instead recover private keys from already exposed public keys offline, subsequently accessing all related unspent UTXOs. Despite these challenges, assuming a quantum-resistant commitment scheme and the necessary adjustments in protocol mechanics, QRAMP's design could effectively serve its intended purpose within its limitations.
For further illustration of the proposed two-phase destination commitment mechanism, references include a [Markdown document](https://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.md) and a [Diagram](https://github.com/bnavf/bitcoinqp/blob/main/two_phase_destination_commitment.svg). The discussion also calls for feedback on the existence of similar proposals, the feasibility of implementing commitment inclusion and maturity proofs without relying on an indexer for consensus, and whether binding the full output set adequately prevents practical variants of destination substitution.</summary>
