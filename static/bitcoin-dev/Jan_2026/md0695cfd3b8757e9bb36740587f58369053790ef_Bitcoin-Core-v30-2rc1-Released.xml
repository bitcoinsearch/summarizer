    <summary>The recent announcement of Bitcoin Core version v30.2rc1 marks an important update in the Bitcoin Core development cycle, available for download at [https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.2/test.rc1](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.2/test.rc1). This new release encompasses several key enhancements, including new features, a range of bug fixes, and performance improvements, along with updated translations to better serve its diverse user base. Users encountering any issues are encouraged to utilize the issue tracker on GitHub at [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) for reporting, ensuring continuous improvement and stability in future releases.

For those operating on older versions of Bitcoin Core, the upgrade process requires shutting down the existing software completely before initiating the installation of the new version. This process is crucial for a smooth transition and may vary in duration depending on system specifications and the previous version's setup. The upgrade guidance emphasizes direct upgrades from versions that have reached their end-of-life (EOL), noting that while possible, these transitions may require additional time for data directory migrations. Furthermore, it reassures users of the support for old wallet versions, highlighting the backward compatibility efforts by the development team.

Compatibility details provided with the release specify the supported operating systems, which include Linux Kernel 3.17 and newer, macOS 13 and above, and Windows 10 or later versions. While Bitcoin Core is expected to function on other Unix-like systems as well, the frequency and extent of testing on such platforms are less than the primary supported OSes. The advisement against using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems underscores the importance of operating within the tested and recommended environment parameters to ensure reliability and security.

The list of notable changes in this release touches on various components of the software, from wallet functionality enhancements and IPC improvements to build system updates and documentation revisions. Specific adjustments include fixes to legacy wallet migration and wallettool creation failures, solutions to shutdown hang issues during certain operations, and updates to the minimum required Boost version for building the software. Additionally, the release notes mention modifications to testing protocols and fuzz documentation, alongside an update to the OpenBSD Build Guide and a copyright year extension to 2026.

Contributors to this release are acknowledged, with special thanks extended to individuals like Ava Chow, brunoerg, fanquake, furszy, Hennadii Stepanov, MarcoFalke, and Ryan Ofsky, among others. Their efforts, along with the global community's support through translation assistance, play a pivotal role in the ongoing development and refinement of Bitcoin Core, ensuring its status as a robust and evolving digital currency platform.</summary>
