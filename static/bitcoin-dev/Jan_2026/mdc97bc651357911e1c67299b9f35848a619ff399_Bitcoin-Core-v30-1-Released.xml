    <summary>The latest version of Bitcoin Core, v30.1, is now available for download at [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-30.1/). This new release introduces a range of updates including new features, bug fixes, performance enhancements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any encountered bugs through the project's GitHub issue tracker, accessible at [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) and stay informed by joining the mailing list at [Bitcoin Core announcements](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).

For those updating from an older version of Bitcoin Core, it is advised to properly shut down the existing version before initiating the upgrade process. This might take some time, especially when migrating data directories if upgrading directly from a version that has reached its end-of-life (EOL). Nevertheless, old wallet versions are generally supported across updates. Compatibility is thoroughly tested and confirmed on Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+ operating systems. While Bitcoin Core may operate on other Unix-like systems, these environments are tested less frequently and using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended.

Significant changes in this release encompass various areas. In terms of the wallet functionality, one update prevents unconfirmed TRUC coins with ancestors from being considered. The build process sees improvements like utilizing `$(package)_file_name` for fallback downloads and adding patches for better integration with Windows 11. Also notable are contributions to the dependability and functionality of IPC options, enhancing the system's overall efficiency and user experience. Specific updates include corrections to multiprocess message logging and enabling cancellation of running `waitNext` calls within miner interfaces.

P2P connectivity is refined by removing certain outdated nodes from the list of DNS seeds, reflecting Bitcoin Core's ongoing commitment to maintain a robust and secure network. GUI advancements focus on modernizing custom filtering and extending history filter capabilities with new wallet management functions. Testing frameworks and documentation have also received updates, streamlining development workflows and clarifying usage instructions for users and developers alike.

Contributors play a pivotal role in the continuous improvement of Bitcoin Core, with several individuals acknowledged for their direct contributions to this release, including but not limited to Ava Chow, Cory Fields, and Eugene Siegel among others. Their efforts, along with the valuable input from translators and the broader community, ensure the ongoing evolution and stability of Bitcoin Core.</summary>
