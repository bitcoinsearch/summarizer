    <summary>The discussion around BIP 3 has reached a significant milestone, with no objections raised since November 29. All previously mentioned concerns were adequately addressed and responded to on the mailing list by December 2, demonstrating a proactive approach to resolving any issues. Further cementing this progress, the latest version of the activation PR has garnered multiple ACKs, signaling a strong agreement within the community. This development is indicative of a rough consensus on the activation of BIP 3, underscoring the community's readiness to move forward. The ongoing uncertainty regarding the activation process has been identified as a source of friction within the BIP process, highlighting the need for clarity and resolution to facilitate smoother operations moving forward.
