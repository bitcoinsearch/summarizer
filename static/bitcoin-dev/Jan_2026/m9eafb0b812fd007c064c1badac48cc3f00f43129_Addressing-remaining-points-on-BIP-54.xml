    <summary>In a recent discussion among members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a notable suggestion was made by Sjors Provoost regarding the optimization of version bits for signaling purposes. The proposal entails allocating an additional 8 bits from the version field specifically for rolling, which is believed to be more than sufficient for current needs. This approach is predicated on the understanding that 8 bits for signaling purposes should adequately meet requirements and that a hashing power of 72PH/2 would suffice for a relatively large ASIC for an extended period. By adopting this strategy, the conversation implies that much of the ongoing debate and complexity surrounding the rolling process could be significantly simplified or eliminated. This idea reflects an ongoing effort within the community to find scalable and efficient solutions to technical challenges, aiming to enhance the system's overall functionality and efficiency.</summary>
