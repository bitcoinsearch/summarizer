    <summary>In the discussion surrounding the enhancement of security measures against potential quantum attacks within the cryptocurrency domain, a specific proposal underlines the necessity of transferring all coins from an old address to a new one immediately after a transaction is conducted. This approach is not only aimed at securing the funds from quantum attackers but also adheres to a long-standing recommendation, which may trace back to the foundational advice provided by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. The proposed strategy emphasizes that once a transaction has been made, the old address should never again be used for receiving any form of currency.

Furthermore, the correspondence introduces a critique regarding the QRAMP proposal, which suggests freezing coins in old addresses as a security measure. The author expresses dissatisfaction with this aspect of QRAMP, advocating instead for the flexibility to transfer coins from old addresses to new ones without any time constraints. This stance is rooted in a desire to enhance the adaptability and security of managing digital currencies in the face of advancing quantum computing capabilities, ensuring that users retain control over their assets without being forced into potentially unfavorable positions by the limitations of a freezing mechanism. The communication concludes with a note of thanks and is facilitated through the use of [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home), underscoring a commitment to secure digital communication.</summary>
