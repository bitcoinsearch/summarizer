    <summary>The email from Conduition addresses Jonas's post on SHRINCS, expressing support for the concept with a suggestion for a more modular approach to facilitate easier standardization. The writer acknowledges the existence of pitfalls within the current proposal but highlights the significance of stateful Hash-Based Signatures (HBS) as the smallest signatures available until advancements in size-efficient stateless schemes, such as SQIsign, are fully developed. The importance of exploring options like SHRINCS is underscored, given its potential as a stateful post-quantum signature solution that incorporates static backups. Despite recognizing the need for further development and refinement in the approach, the sender views the proposal positively as a step towards innovative cryptographic solutions. For a detailed understanding of the sender's perspective and thoughts on SHRINCS, they provide a link to their full commentary hosted on a dedicated platform for discussions related to Bitcoin development. The provided link, [here](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/shrincs-324-byte-stateful-post-quantum-signatures-with-static-backups/2158/7?u=conduition), directs readers to a page where the conversation about the future of cryptographic standards in the face of quantum computing advances continues.</summary>
