    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a discussion took place focusing on the technical specifics of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 141, particularly concerning coinbase transactions. Sjors Provoost brought up an issue regarding the structure of coinbase transactions as per BIP 141, which mandates that coinbase transaction inputs must include a 32-byte witness. This requirement is pivotal because, in the serialization process of these transactions, the witness section appears after the outputs but before the `nLocktime`. This means that the bytes preceding the `nLocktime` in a coinbase transaction correspond to the witness pertaining to the coinbase input rather than being associated with the last output script. This clarification is crucial for developers and participants in the Bitcoin network to understand the intricacies of transaction formation and the specific requirements set forth by BIP 141.</summary>
