    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a concept was clarified regarding the calculation of the Merkle root. It was pointed out that the Merkle root is determined based on the stripped transaction, confirming that AJ's idea is applicable and effective within this context. This clarification addresses any uncertainties surrounding the method of calculating the Merkle root in blockchain transactions, reinforcing the viability of AJ's approach to the matter. The acknowledgment of AJ's idea not only resolves previous doubts but also encourages the continuation of the current discussion without further need for correction or reconsideration. This exchange underscores the collaborative and technical nature of discussions within the Bitcoin development community, highlighting how collective insights contribute to clarifying complex technical details.</summary>
