    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there was a detailed discussion about the serialization of transactions in modern blocks. Antoine highlighted that, following Murch's explanation, transactions are indeed serialized in the manner described by Murch for contemporary block structures. Furthermore, it was clarified that for the purpose of computing the Merkle root, transactions are serialized without including the witness data. This specific aspect of transaction serialization is crucial for understanding the technical intricacies of how Bitcoin transactions are processed and verified within the blockchain framework.</summary>
