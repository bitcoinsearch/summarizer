    <summary>In the ongoing discussions about network adjustments and test cases, a significant point of concern is the overproduction of blocks on Testnet4. The network has produced approximately 30,000 more blocks than anticipated between today and the Genesis Block. This discrepancy raises questions about the timing for re-adjusting the difficulty level of block production. While the typical adjustment period might be two weeks, extending it to three months could potentially mitigate the issue without major consequences, considering the surplus of 1.5 million coins already in existence.

Moreover, the proposal to reject all blocks with CPU difficulty presents a challenge for network stability. Such a measure could lead to periods of stagnation within the updated network. The transient participation of ASIC miners, who temporarily elevate the difficulty level and then depart, would exacerbate this issue. Their activity could leave the majority of users facing a halted chain, unable to continue transactions or mine new blocks efficiently. This scenario underscores the need for a balanced approach to difficulty adjustment and highlights the complexities of managing a decentralized network like Bitcoin.</summary>
