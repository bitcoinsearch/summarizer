    <summary>The latest software release, version 30.2, has seen significant contributions from two members of the community, jestory and davidgumberg. These individuals played crucial roles by identifying and confirming the presence of a bug not only within the primary application but also in the bitcoin-wallet tool, an aspect that significantly impacts the software's performance and reliability. Despite their substantial contributions to this release, it has been noted that both contributors have not been acknowledged in the credits section, an oversight that raises questions about the criteria for recognition within the project. This situation highlights the importance of reviews, testing, and other forms of contribution beyond direct code submission, suggesting a broader definition of contribution that encompasses various forms of support and quality assurance. This incident underscores the need for a more inclusive acknowledgment system that recognizes all forms of contribution to the development process, ensuring that every individual who plays a part in enhancing the software is duly credited.</summary>
