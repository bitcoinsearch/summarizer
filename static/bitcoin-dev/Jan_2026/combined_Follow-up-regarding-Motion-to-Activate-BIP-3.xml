    <summary>The dialogue around the adoption of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 3 (BIP 3) has been a focal point within the community, drawing significant attention and support. Initially, the proposal received positive feedback from approximately a dozen members, advocating for its implementation as a new guideline for future BIPs. However, some concerns were raised, leading to modifications of the proposal. These changes, particularly the withdrawal of the controversial LLM-policy after community feedback, have been well-received, with no significant objections noted post-adjustment.
A diverse group of key figures in the Bitcoin community, including Ava Chow, David Gumberg, Jon Atack, Jonas Nick, Gloria Zhao, Michael Ford, Ruben Somsen, Greg Sanders, and Antoine Poinsot, have voiced their support for BIP 3. This endorsement was further strengthened by Pieter Wuille’s conditional support, which was predicated on the reversal of the LLM-guidance—a condition that has been fulfilled. The proposition gained additional backing after an update on December 15th, with AJ Towns, Tim Ruffing, and Pol Espinasa endorsing the revised proposal. This broad spectrum of support underlines a strong inclination towards activating BIP 3, indicating that initial reservations have been satisfactorily resolved.
Despite this widespread endorsement, Melvin Carvalho highlighted a crucial aspect of the process, suggesting that the determination of rough consensus for BIP 3's activation should not be left solely to the proposal's author. This perspective emphasizes the need for a comprehensive community evaluation and commentary to truly ascertain if a consensus has been reached. The ongoing discussions and iterative refinements of BIP 3 reflect the Bitcoin development community's dynamic, collaborative approach to decision-making, emphasizing open critique and collective input. This process exemplifies the community's dedication to evolving the BIPs process in alignment with shared values and vision, as detailed in the mailing list summary accessible via [this link](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/j4_toD-ofEc/m/esV-XScYAAAJ).</summary>
