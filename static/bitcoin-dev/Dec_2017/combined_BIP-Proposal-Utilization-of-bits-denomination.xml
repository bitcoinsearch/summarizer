    <summary>The ongoing debate about the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin has sparked discussions among users. Some argue in favor of using &quot;bits&quot; as a denomination due to its compatibility with existing financial software, making integration into legacy systems easier. The simplicity and clarity of the term also appeal to users. However, others raise concerns about the potential confusion caused by homonyms within the same context.Ryan, a user who has been using &quot;bits&quot; on his website, believes it is a great unit that people quickly adapt to when dealing with large amounts of money. He suggests making &quot;bits&quot; the default unit everywhere for consistency. Ethan agrees with the use of SI prefixes but argues that the base unit should be easy for intuition to comprehend. Marcel Jamin argues for using Bitcoin (BTC), Millibitcoin (mBTC), and Microbitcoin (ÂµBTC) as the correct units to prevent confusion for beginners.Coinbase, a popular platform, has already adopted &quot;bits&quot; as the default unit for over two years, which could lead to it becoming the standard due to linguistic network effects. However, Natanael raises concerns about the potential confusion caused by multiple meanings of &quot;bits.&quot;The discussion also touches on the use of SI prefixes in Bitcoin units. One suggestion is to make 100 satoshi equal to 1 mu. The idea of using &quot;finney&quot; as a unit of value is also supported, with its smallest unit being 1 satoshi. Redefining &quot;satoshi&quot; to 10^-9 BTC is dismissed. The argument against using &quot;bits&quot; revolves around the confusion that could arise from its multiple meanings within the same context.A post on Reddit argues against using &quot;bits&quot; due to its potential confusion for beginners. The author acknowledges the interpretation of homonyms based on context but highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between different meanings of &quot;bits&quot; within the same context. This could cause confusion for users.David A. Harding suggests that &quot;microbitcoins&quot; would be a better denomination than &quot;bits.&quot; He argues that &quot;microbitcoins&quot; is not a homonym for any other word and emphasizes the importance of training users to understand SI prefixes. The shift to &quot;bits&quot; as the standard unit may happen eventually, but the major Bitcoin denomination is likely to remain.The proposal to standardize the term &quot;bits&quot; has received mixed responses. Some see it as a practical solution, while others find it unnecessary and confusing. The use of &quot;microbitcoins&quot; is suggested to train users in understanding SI prefixes. However, some prefer terms that are easy to grasp immediately. The potential need for a new term and hard fork if bitcoin prices rise significantly is also discussed.Jimmy Song proposes a BIP to standardize the term &quot;bits&quot; within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The motivation behind this proposal is to facilitate comprehension as the price of bitcoin grows. Using &quot;bits&quot; instead of satoshis or milli-bitcoin reduces user error on small amounts and allows for easier comparisons of prices with fiat currencies. The proposal suggests displaying all Bitcoin-denominated items in bits. The specification defines 1 bit as 1/1,000,000 bitcoin and pluralizes &quot;bit&quot; as &quot;bits.&quot; Existing terms such as satoshi and milli-bitcoin do not conflict and can coexist with &quot;bits.&quot;In conclusion, the debate about the standard unit of measurement for Bitcoin continues. The use of &quot;bits&quot; has both practical benefits and potential confusion concerns. Users have different perspectives on the matter, with some advocating for &quot;bits&quot; and others suggesting alternatives like microbitcoins. The proposal to standardize &quot;bits&quot; has gained attention, highlighting its advantages in simplifying comprehension and facilitating comparisons.</summary>
