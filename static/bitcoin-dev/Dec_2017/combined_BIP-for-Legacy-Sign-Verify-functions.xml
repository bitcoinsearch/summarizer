    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, Luke Dashjr raises questions about the use of signatures and public keys in Bitcoin transactions. He explains how key recovery is performed using the signature and message to extract the public key of the signer, which is then hashed and compared to the provided address. Aymeric Vitte also questions the role of pubkey in sigscript for standard p2pkh transactions.Luke Dashjr criticizes a proposal to enhance the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) by providing a reference point for new address schemes. He argues that it is impossible to get a public key from an address and suggests that new schemes should not be based on the current one.Dan Bryant also criticizes a proposed BIP by Brian Deery, which suggests deriving a public key from a Bitcoin address. Bryant claims that this is incorrect and highlights that key recovery is used to extract the public key of the signer for comparison.The proposal for expanding capabilities into new address schemes is put forward by brianddk. Although the functionality of signing or verifying messages against SegWit P2SH addresses has been established, it has not yet been published in a BIP. The aim of the proposal is to provide a reference point for future expansion.Aymeric Vitte has shared various links related to simplifying Bitcoin transactions, Zcash wallets, Bitcoin wallets on GitHub, torrent dynamic blocklists, anti-spies and private torrents, and peersm. The original reference thread for the proposal can be found at the provided link.</summary>
