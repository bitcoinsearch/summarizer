    <summary>The discourse on how to counteract the potential threats posed by quantum computing (QC) to Bitcoin's security and economic stability has sparked significant discussion within the development community. One aspect of this conversation centers on the strategic use of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) by entities equipped with quantum capabilities. The argument suggests that such entities could maximize their benefits by publicly broadcasting transactions, allowing for their inclusion in blocks mined by others alongside their mining efforts. This strategy hinges on the differentiation between UTXOs used for public broadcast and those reserved for self-mining, ensuring a steady flow of mining operations even if external miners include one of the broadcasted UTXOs in a block. This approach underscores the necessity for QC-capable entities to adopt nuanced strategies for engaging in cryptocurrency mining and transaction management.

In another vein of discussion, Boris Nagaev critiques a proposal designed to dilute the impact of quantum computing on Bitcoin by spreading Pay-to-PubKey (P2PK) output spends over time. Nagaev argues that this measure may not be sufficient to mitigate the initial economic shock post-Quantum Day, given the rapid capabilities of quantum computers in cracking cryptographic keys. He highlights the vulnerability of high-value addresses, exemplified by an address holding 31,000 BTC, which could be quickly exploited by quantum attackers due to its exposed public key from address reuse. Nagaev's critique stresses the need for a more comprehensive strategy that accounts for high-value reused addresses and the rapid liquidation risks they pose, pointing out the inadequacies of the current proposal in addressing these concerns.

Furthermore, the discussion explores the concept of allowing early P2PK coins to be "naturally recycled" without modifying their unlocking scripts as a superior solution both technically and ethically. This approach is seen as preferable to freezing or burning vulnerable coins and is predicated on the speculation about future quantum computing capabilities. The debate touches on various outcomes, including the possibility of bidding wars for transaction inclusion or collusion among entities with QC capabilities to manipulate fees. It also raises concerns about Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and the competitive landscape for miners without QC resources, underscoring the complex challenges in securing Bitcoin against technological advancements without compromising its foundational principles.

Lastly, a straightforward proposal has been put forth to prevent the mass liquidation of P2PK funds, detailed in a specification document available on GitHub ([this link](https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/blob/hourglass/bip-hourglass.mediawiki)). This proposal seeks to address the vulnerabilities associated with P2PK funds in the face of advancing quantum computing technology, inviting community feedback and contribution to refine the approach. This initiative underscores the collaborative effort within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List to enhance Bitcoin's technical evolution and security in anticipation of quantum computing challenges.</summary>
