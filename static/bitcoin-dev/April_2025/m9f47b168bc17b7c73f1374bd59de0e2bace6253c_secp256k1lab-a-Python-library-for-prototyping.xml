    <summary>The maintainers have acknowledged that both MuSig2 and adaptor signatures fall within the scope of their interests. Despite this inclusion, there is no current intention from their side to actively integrate these features into their systems. The presence of BIP 340's implementation over just raw elliptic curve functionalities in their library is attributed to its utilization within the ChillDKG reference code. This implies a precedent for incorporating additional schemes based on actual demand and application, similar to how BIP 340 was integrated. Specifically, MuSig2 stands out as a favorable candidate for addition due to its existing Python reference implementation and accompanying test vectors, suggesting that its integration could be more straightforward compared to other potential enhancements. This communication was directed to members of the "Bitcoin Development Mailing List" group, indicating its relevance to individuals deeply engaged with the development and evolution of Bitcoin-related technologies.</summary>
