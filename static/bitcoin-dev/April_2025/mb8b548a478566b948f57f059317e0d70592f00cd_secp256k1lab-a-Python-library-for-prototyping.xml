    <summary>The email from AdamISZ/waxwing expresses appreciation for a new initiative that is believed to greatly benefit prototyping and education, with an emphasis on the standardization of proposal "reference" code as a primary motive. The sender inquires about the scope of the project, specifically questioning whether advanced cryptographic concepts like MuSig2 and adaptors are included or if the focus is solely on foundational elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) operations and Schnorr signatures. This inquiry stems from personal experience, noting that such features were time-consuming in past prototyping efforts, exemplified by the development of "pathcoin."

The project is recognized for its potential impact on streamlining the process of developing new protocols by providing a standardized reference for foundational ECC operations, while also incorporating Schnorr signatures. The sender's question highlights a gap between the foundational elements provided by the initiative and more complex cryptographic techniques that could be essential for innovative protocol development. Through this exchange, there is an implicit suggestion for the inclusion or consideration of these advanced features to further support the developer community in their prototyping endeavors.</summary>
