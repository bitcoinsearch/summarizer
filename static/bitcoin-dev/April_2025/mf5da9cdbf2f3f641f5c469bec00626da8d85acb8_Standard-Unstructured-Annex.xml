    <summary>The discussion revolves around a query raised regarding the efficacy of having an annex in all inputs to prevent transaction pinning attacks within multi-party protocols. The concern outlined is based on the understanding that even if every input has an annex, it does not necessarily mitigate the risk of a party inflating the weight of their annex. This action would allow them to broadcast a heavier, lower-fee rate version of the transaction. Such a scenario suggests that merely having an annex for each input may not be sufficient to counteract the potential for one party to alter their annex, re-sign, and then broadcast a more burdensome transaction. This inquiry points towards a gap in understanding or an update on the mechanisms like full Replace-By-Fee (RBF) strategies and how they interact with pinning attacks in the context of current developments in Bitcoin protocol enhancements.</summary>
