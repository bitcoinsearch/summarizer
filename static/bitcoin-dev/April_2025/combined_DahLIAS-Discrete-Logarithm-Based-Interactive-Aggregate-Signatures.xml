    <summary>AdamISZ, known as waxwing, initiates a detailed discussion on the susceptibility of MuSig2 and its adaptation, MuSig2-IAS, to a specific form of attack. This inquiry delves into the mechanics of how an adversary could potentially forge a partial signature by tweaking an honest signer's public key. The crux of AdamISZ's question lies in understanding why this attack strategy seems applicable only to MuSig2-IAS and not to MuSig2 directly. He underscores an attack process that manipulates R-values and partial signatures, suggesting a possible vulnerability in MuSig2 that mirrors the issues presented in MuSig2-IAS. Despite recognizing certain protections against such an attack in three-round versions of MuSig and specific Proofs of Knowledge (PoK) of R, AdamISZ seeks clarification on the inherent safeguards within MuSig2.

The discussion is set against the backdrop of a broader conversation among members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, where participants engage in high-level technical exchanges focused on enhancing cryptographic practices within blockchain development. This dialogue emphasizes the community's commitment to identifying and addressing potential security gaps in cryptographic protocols used within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

In parallel, the paper titled "DahLIAS" by Jonas Nick, Tim Ruffing, and Yannick Seurin emerges as a significant contribution to the field of cryptographic protocols, particularly with its focus on Cross-Input Signature Aggregation (CISA). The document, available at [eprint.iacr.org](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf), presents DahLIAS as the first interactive aggregate signature scheme that produces constant-size signatures compatible with secp256k1, thereby offering a promising solution for reducing transaction sizes and verification costs in applications like Bitcoin. Unlike previous attempts at creating constant-size aggregate signatures, DahLIAS overcomes challenges related to cryptographic assumptions and provides a secure, efficient framework that supports key tweaking without compromising security. Its operational efficiency is further underscored by a two-round communication process for signing, which does not necessitate prior knowledge of the messages to be signed. Additionally, DahLIAS signatures can be verified significantly faster than half aggregate Schnorr signatures and even more so in batch verifications of individual Schnorr signatures, highlighting its potential as a cornerstone for future CISA proposals. The authors of DahLIAS express a willingness to engage with feedback and discussions, indicating an ongoing effort to refine cryptographic solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
