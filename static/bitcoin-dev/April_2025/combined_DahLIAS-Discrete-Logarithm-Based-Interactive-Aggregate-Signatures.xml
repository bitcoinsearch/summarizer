    <summary>The discourse surrounding the MuSig2 cryptographic protocol delves into its susceptibility to a particular form of attack, which pivots on the ability of an attacker to request and forge partial signatures. This discussion is particularly focused on distinguishing between the traditional MuSig2 scheme and its variant, MuSig2-IAS (Implicitly Authenticated Signatures), with respect to their response to an attack where the adversary modifies the public key and possibly the message. The crux of this differentiation lies in how each scheme treats the authenticity of the resulting signatures. For MuSig2, the generated signature aligns with the original message signed by the honest party, casting ambiguity on whether it should be considered a forgery. On the other hand, the signature produced under MuSig2-IAS, which verifies an unauthored message, clearly constitutes a forgery violating the EUF-CMA-TK security model as delineated in the DahLIAS paper. This distinction underscores the nuanced complexities of cryptographic security and the imperative for explicit security models to assess the integrity of such protocols effectively. Despite the theoretical feasibility of this attack vector, its practical implications for the MuSig2 protocol remain speculative, suggesting a need for formal acknowledgment and mitigation strategies within foundational documents like the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to bolster protocol resilience.

AdamISZ's inquiry into the DahLIAS algorithm concerns the specific use of R2 values over R1 in the signing process, questioning the necessity and optimization behind this choice relative to the MuSig2 protocol, where both R1 and R2 values are aggregated by the coordinator. This question points towards a deeper technical examination of the algorithm's resistance to attacks that manipulate R-values and partial signatures. AdamISZ further delves into the potential vulnerability stemming from the multisig-to-IAS translation, highlighting a known issue from prior research but expressing uncertainty about why MuSig2 remains unaffected by similar attacks. His reflection suggests a gap or misunderstanding in the protective mechanisms exclusive to MuSig2 against such exploit strategies, signaling an active engagement with the cryptographic community for clarification and enhancement of these protocols.

The introduction of DahLIAS represents a significant milestone in cryptographic protocol development, offering the first interactive aggregate signature scheme compatible with secp256k1. This breakthrough, documented in a comprehensive paper available at [eprint.iacr.org](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/692.pdf), is poised to revolutionize Cross-Input Signature Aggregation (CISA) by enabling constant-size signatures (64 bytes) that facilitate reduced transaction sizes and lower verification costs. Unlike previous schemes that either deviated from the discrete logarithm problem central to Bitcoin’s signature algorithm or lacked thorough validation, DahLIAS emerges as a robust, efficient solution validated for security even with key tweaking—a known point of failure in other proposals derived from MuSig2. Its efficiency is further accentuated by a two-round signing process that does not require pre-knowledge of the messages, alongside verification speeds surpassing existing aggregate and individual Schnorr signatures. By addressing past limitations and introducing operational efficiencies, DahLIAS sets a new standard for CISA applications, particularly within the Bitcoin ecosystem, underscoring the authors' dedication to fostering advancements through open feedback and collaboration within the cryptographic community.</summary>
