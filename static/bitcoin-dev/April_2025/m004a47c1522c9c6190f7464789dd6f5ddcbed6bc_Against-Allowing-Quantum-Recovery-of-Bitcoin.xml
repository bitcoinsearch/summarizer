    <summary>The conversation among Bitcoin developers, particularly between Jameson Lopp and Matt, highlights the proactive steps being considered to secure Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats. The core idea revolves around the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into Bitcoin's infrastructure sooner rather than later. This preemptive measure aims at ensuring that Bitcoin wallets embed PQC public keys within their outputs, a move suggested to take place at least a decade before any potential threat materializes. Such an approach is advocated to provide a significant safety margin, safeguarding Bitcoin from quantum computing advancements.

Matt proposes the adoption of a straightforward form of PQC, specifically suggesting OP_HASHBASEDSIG, likely with SPHINCS+, to be added to tapscript. This would allow for the inclusion of hidden PQC keys, including those used in multisig configurations, within Bitcoin's taptrees. The underlying motivation for this suggestion is to prepare for future scenarios where seizing non-PQC coins might become a necessity. By taking these steps today, the Bitcoin community aims to retain the flexibility to address quantum challenges without rushing into decisions under duress.

This discourse underscores the Bitcoin development community's forward-thinking approach to security and its readiness to adopt advanced cryptographic measures to protect against emerging technological threats. The emphasis on embedding PQC public keys well ahead of any direct quantum threat reflects a strategic, long-term perspective on safeguarding the cryptocurrency's integrity and user assets.</summary>
