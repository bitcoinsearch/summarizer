    <summary>The discussion within the Bitcoin development community emphasizes an urgent need for the adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to secure Bitcoin against potential quantum computing threats. The suggestion put forth involves the integration of a simple PQC mechanism into Bitcoin's infrastructure sooner rather than later. This proactive approach is deemed necessary to ensure that the network remains secure in the face of evolving computational capabilities. Specifically, the proposal includes embedding PQC public keys in wallet outputs, utilizing a straightforward operation called OP_HASHBASEDSIG, likely using the SPHINCS+ algorithm, within tapscript. This would enable wallets to have hidden PQC keys, applicable also for multisig configurations, within their taptrees.

The rationale behind this initiative stems from the anticipation of needing to possibly seize non-PQC coins in the future to maintain network integrity and security. To make this option viable and practical, it is argued that wallets need to start incorporating PQC public keys well in advance, ideally a decade before any potential seizure actions might be required. This precautionary measure would provide a significant safety margin against the threat posed by quantum computers to the current cryptographic foundations of Bitcoin. The urgency and importance of moving towards simple PQC solutions are highlighted as a strategic move to safeguard Bitcoin's future viability and security.</summary>
