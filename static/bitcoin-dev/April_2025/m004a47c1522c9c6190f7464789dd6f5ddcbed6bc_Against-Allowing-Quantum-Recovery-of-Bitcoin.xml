    <summary>In a recent discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there has been a strong motivation expressed towards the implementation of simplistic Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) measures within the current bitcoin infrastructure. The underlying idea is not to resolve the complex issues surrounding the potential seizure of non-PQC compliant coins immediately but to ensure that the bitcoin ecosystem is equipped with the necessary tools to address such challenges in the future. This approach underscores the importance of forward-thinking and proactive adaptation to emerging technological advancements.

Matt highlighted the practicality of embedding PQC public keys into wallet outputs well ahead of any potential necessity for coin seizure, suggesting a timeline of at least a decade in advance. This strategy is aimed at providing a significant safety margin, minimizing risks associated with the transition. The proposal involves incorporating a straightforward OP_HASHBASEDSIG mechanism, likely utilizing SPHINCS+, into tapscript. Such an integration would enable the concealment of PQC keys, including those used in multisignature configurations, within taptrees, thereby enhancing the security and resilience of the bitcoin network against quantum computing threats.

This discourse reflects a broader consensus on the urgency of integrating post-quantum cryptographic solutions into the bitcoin protocol. The community's proactive stance signifies a commitment to safeguarding the network's integrity and user assets against evolving cyber threats, ensuring the longevity and robustness of the blockchain technology underpinning bitcoin.</summary>
