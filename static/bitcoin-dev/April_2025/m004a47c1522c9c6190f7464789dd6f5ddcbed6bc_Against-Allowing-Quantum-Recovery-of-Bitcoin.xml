    <summary>In recent discussions among Bitcoin developers, there has emerged a consensus on the importance of incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into Bitcoin's infrastructure to safeguard against future quantum computing threats. Matt highlighted the urgency of embedding PQC public keys within wallet outputs well in advance of any potential threat, suggesting a preemptive timeline that spans at least a decade before any anticipated action to seize non-PQC compliant coins might occur. This proactive approach is deemed necessary to maintain the security and integrity of Bitcoin transactions against quantum vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for a simple yet effective PQC solution.

The proposed method involves the integration of a basic form of PQC, specifically an OP_HASHBASEDSIG mechanism, likely utilizing SPHINCS+, into tapscript. This would enable the concealment of PQC keys, including those used in multisig configurations, within taptrees. The rationale behind this strategy underscores the significance of not only preparing for quantum resistance but also ensuring that Bitcoin remains ahead of potential quantum computing capabilities that could threaten its cryptographic foundations. The discussion reflects a broader recognition within the cryptocurrency community of the evolving challenges posed by advancements in quantum computing and the critical need for preemptive security measures to protect digital assets.</summary>
