    <summary>In a recent discussion within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the topic of integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into Bitcoin was addressed to enhance security against quantum computer attacks. The discourse suggested that now is an opportune time to implement a basic form of PQC, specifically by embedding PQC public keys within wallet outputs. This measure is to ensure future flexibility in potentially seizing non-PQC compliant coins if necessary. It was proposed that this could be achieved through a simple yet effective method, introducing an OP_HASHBASEDSIG, likely utilizing SPHINCS+, into tapscript. This would allow for the incorporation of hidden PQC keys, including those used in multisignature setups, within Bitcoin's taptrees.

The suggestion underlines the importance of taking proactive steps at least a decade in advance of any potential seizure actions to maintain a significant safety margin. The implementation of such cryptography measures is aimed at fortifying Bitcoin's security infrastructure against the evolving threat posed by quantum computing capabilities. This conversation reflects a broader consensus on the need for the Bitcoin development community to address and adapt to future technological challenges proactively.</summary>
