    <summary>In a recent discussion within the Bitcoin development community, there has been a push towards adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to safeguard against future quantum computing threats. The conversation highlights the urgency of integrating PQC mechanisms, specifically through the implementation of a simple yet effective form of PQC known as OP_HASHBASEDSIG, likely incorporating SPHINCS+, into tapscript. This move is intended to enable wallets to embed hidden PQC keys, including those for multisig configurations, within their taptrees.

The rationale behind this proactive approach stems from the anticipation of potential future scenarios where it might become necessary to seize non-PQC compliant coins. To make such options viable and practical, the embedding of PQC public keys in wallet outputs would need to commence at least a decade prior to any enforcement action. This timeframe is considered critical to ensure an adequate safety margin against the evolving quantum threat landscape.

This discussion underscores the Bitcoin community's recognition of the looming quantum computing challenges and represents a consensus on the need for early adoption of PQC solutions. By considering the integration of simple PQC forms like OP_HASHBASEDSIG with SPHINCS+ into tapscript, the community aims to fortify Bitcoin's resilience against quantum attacks while maintaining flexibility in managing future regulatory and security requirements.</summary>
