    <summary>In recent discussions within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there has been a significant emphasis on the incorporation of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into the Bitcoin protocol to safeguard against potential future threats posed by quantum computing. The dialogue highlighted the urgency of embedding PQC public keys in Bitcoin wallets as a precautionary measure to ensure the security of digital assets against quantum attacks. This proactive strategy involves the implementation of a basic form of PQC, specifically using an operation called OP_HASHBASEDSIG, likely employing SPHINCS+ as the algorithm of choice, into tapscript. This method would allow for the seamless integration of hidden PQC keys, including those used in multisig configurations, within Bitcoin’s taptrees.

The discussion underlines the necessity of introducing these measures well in advance of any potential threat, suggesting a lead time of at least a decade before any quantum-related seizure of non-PQC coins might become feasible. Such a timeline is considered critical not only to prepare adequately for the transition but also to provide a sufficient safety margin against the rapid advancement of quantum computing capabilities. The essence of the conversation suggests a forward-looking approach to Bitcoin’s development, where safeguarding the network and its assets against future technological disruptions takes precedence. By contemplating the addition of simple yet effective PQC mechanisms today, the community aims to secure the option of protecting Bitcoin from quantum vulnerabilities, thereby ensuring its resilience and long-term viability in the face of evolving computational challenges.</summary>
