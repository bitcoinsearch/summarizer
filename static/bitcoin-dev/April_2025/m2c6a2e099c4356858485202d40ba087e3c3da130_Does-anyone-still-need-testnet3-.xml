    <summary>In the correspondence, a concern is raised regarding the potential for abuse in applications that utilize significantly different exchange rates for cryptocurrencies when compared to established centralized exchanges. The example provided illustrates a disparity where 1 tBTC3 is equivalent to 300 satoshis, whereas 1 tBTC4 equals 25 satoshis on centralized platforms. This discrepancy indicates that 1 tBTC3 would be valued at 12 tBTC4, highlighting the risk of exploitation if an app were to adopt a markedly divergent exchange rate. The discussion takes place within the context of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, indicating its relevance to cryptocurrency development and exchange rate mechanisms.</summary>
