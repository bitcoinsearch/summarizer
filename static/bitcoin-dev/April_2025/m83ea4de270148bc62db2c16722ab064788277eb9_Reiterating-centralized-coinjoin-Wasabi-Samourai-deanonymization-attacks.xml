    <summary>The Wasabi Wallet documentation has undergone significant updates regarding its CoinJoin transaction policies, especially concerning the handling of change outputs. As of late 2024, it is explicitly stated within their documentation that in certain uncommon scenarios where a CoinJoin transaction results in a change output of a maximum of 10,000 satoshis (sats) per CoinJoin, this leftover amount is directed to the transaction coordinator. This policy aims at enhancing privacy for the users and reducing potential costs that could arise from dealing with such small amounts of change. This approach underscores the platform's commitment to user privacy, even if it means forfeiting small amounts of change that could otherwise complicate or reduce the effectiveness of their privacy measures.

The introduction of this policy can be traced back through various sources, including archived versions of their website and GitHub commit histories. Specifically, the changes were first noted on November 23, 2024, through the Wayback Machine's archive of the Wasabi Wallet documentation and were likely introduced in a GitHub commit on October 10, 2024. The commit in question is verified by a PGP signature as of November 9, 2024, underscoring the authenticity and planned implementation of these updates in the wallet's operational guidelines. These details not only illustrate the timeline and verification process of the changes but also highlight the wallet's transparent approach to informing users about modifications that might affect their transactions.

For interested parties or researchers, further information and the specifics of these changes can be reviewed through the provided links to both the archived webpage and the GitHub commit. These resources offer a deeper insight into the technical and operational reasoning behind the decision to direct small change amounts to the coordinator, reinforcing Wasabi Wallet's emphasis on privacy and user benefit.
