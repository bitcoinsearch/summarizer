    <summary>In the realm of cryptographic advancements, a notable optimization has been highlighted concerning signature processes. This optimization focuses on the signer's requirements during the signing phase, specifically pointing out that the signer necessitates only the R2 values, unlike in MuSig2, where both R1 and R2 values are subject to aggregation by the coordinator. This distinction underscores a streamlined approach in handling signatures, which could potentially enhance efficiency and security in cryptographic protocols. The conversation is part of ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, indicating its relevance and impact on cryptocurrency technologies and their development.</summary>
