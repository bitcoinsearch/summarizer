    <summary>The discussion delves into the concept of implementing a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) secure scheme within the Bitcoin protocol to safeguard against potential quantum computer threats. The initial idea proposed was to introduce a secure leaf that could act as the sole spending path, but upon further contemplation, a suggestion has been made to adopt a new address or taproot version instead. This approach offers several advantages. Firstly, it enables the public tracking of how many coins are secured under the PQC scheme, thereby facilitating more informed decisions regarding adoption rates, planning, and understanding the community's sentiment towards quantum threats. Secondly, it provides a clear distinction for users between PQC-secured and non-PQC-secured addresses, enhancing user knowledge and security awareness.

Furthermore, this proposal ensures that users who are unconcerned about quantum threats are not compelled to use longer descriptors or unnecessary leaves, maintaining simplicity and usability. From a development standpoint, introducing a separate category for PQC transactions could result in a cleaner separation in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, aiding both library and wallet developers in distinguishing between legacy taproot (tr) and PQC-secured taproot (pqc-tr) transactions without confusion over descriptions and script code.

Another critical aspect discussed is the consideration of transaction space and computational resource requirements for PQC transactions. Given these increased demands, the message cautions against prematurely incentivizing certain approaches without thorough confidence in their efficacy. It suggests that significant fee discounts might be warranted once there is high certainty in a chosen method. However, the enhanced security provided by adopting a PQC scheme is recognized as an intrinsic incentive, which should arguably factor into the incentive calculation for transitioning towards such protocols.</summary>
