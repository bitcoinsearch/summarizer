    <summary>The discussion emphasizes the importance of developing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) secure schemes for Bitcoin transactions before considering mechanisms like burning or freezing coins as a response to quantum computing threats. A major suggestion includes transitioning to a new address or Taproot version specifically designed to be PQC-secure. This approach offers several advantages, such as making public data available on the usage of PQC schemes, thereby aiding in adoption decisions and gauging the community's perception of quantum threats. It also promises a clear distinction between PQC-secured and non-secured addresses, enabling users to easily identify the security status of their assets without complicating their wallets with additional descriptors.

Furthermore, the proposal advocates for a clean separation in user interfaces and experiences, helping both users and developers differentiate between legacy and PQC-secured transactions without confusion over scripts and descriptions. This separation could simplify the integration process for wallet and library developers, focusing on enhancing user experience through clarity and ease of use. The discussion also touches on the potential need for significant incentives, such as fee discounts, to encourage the adoption of PQC methods once they are deemed reliable. However, it acknowledges that the increased security provided by PQC could inherently serve as a compelling incentive for its adoption.

The conversation underlines the necessity of careful consideration regarding the roll-out of such technologies. It suggests avoiding premature commitments to specific approaches until there is high confidence in their efficacy and practicality, especially given the anticipated increase in transaction space and computational requirements associated with PQC transactions. By focusing on a strategic, user-friendly implementation, the proposal aims to address the challenges posed by quantum computing without imposing undue burdens on users who may not yet perceive these threats as immediate concerns.</summary>
