    <summary>In the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency security, particularly with the advent of quantum computing, there is a pressing need to develop post-quantum cryptography (PQC) secure schemes for Bitcoin transactions. The discussion leans towards the idea of creating a new address or Taproot version that is PQC secure. This approach offers several advantages. First, it allows for the public tracking of how many coins are secured through PQC schemes, aiding in better decision-making regarding adoption rates and planning. It also provides a clear distinction for users to recognize whether their addresses are safeguarded against quantum attacks.

Furthermore, this method avoids burdening users who are less concerned about quantum computing threats with unnecessary complexities in their transaction descriptors. It proposes a cleaner separation in user experience and interface by delineating between legacy and PQC-secured transaction types without confusing users with additional technical details. Moreover, this separation could simplify the development process for libraries and wallets by establishing clear guidelines on handling different types of transactions, enhancing both usability and security.

The proposal suggests avoiding premature commitments to specific incentivization strategies for adopting PQC measures, such as significant fee discounts, until there is a clearer understanding of the most effective approaches. While acknowledging that the transition to PQC will likely demand more computational resources and space, it highlights that the primary motivation for users to migrate to PQC-secured transactions should be the enhanced security it offers rather than financial incentives. This perspective underscores the importance of prioritizing security and user clarity in the development of future-proof cryptographic solutions for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
