    <summary>In the ongoing discussions among programmers and developers, particularly within the Bitcoin Development community, there's a growing consensus on the necessity to develop and implement post-quantum cryptography (PQC) secured schemes. This initiative stems from the anticipation of potential threats quantum computing could pose to current cryptographic standards. The dialogue has evolved from considering minor adjustments, such as secure leaf enabling for transactions, towards advocating for a more robust and clean-cut solution: the introduction of new addresses or taproot versions specifically designed to be PQC secure.

The proposed shift to PQC-secured addresses offers several advantages. Firstly, it would make public the quantity of coins protected under the PQC scheme, thereby facilitating a more informed discussion about adoption rates, planning strategies, and general sentiment regarding the urgency of quantum threats. This transparency is crucial for collective decision-making in the crypto space. Secondly, users would benefit from a clear distinction, knowing with certainty whether their assets are safeguarded by PQC measures. This delineation also promises to alleviate concerns for users indifferent to quantum threats, sparing them the complexity of longer descriptors and additional transactional layers that would otherwise be unnecessary.

Another aspect under consideration is the user experience, particularly how library and wallet developers might handle the transition. A clean separation between traditional and PQC-secured transactions could simplify both development and user interface design, avoiding confusion between legacy and PQC-secured transaction descriptors and scripts. This approach would negate the need for a transitional period or specific flag day to mandate the use of secure leaves or paths for transactions, streamlining the adoption process.

However, caution is advised regarding the roll-out of PQC transactions, given they are expected to demand more computational resources and space. The conversation suggests a balanced approach to incentivizing these schemes, possibly through significant fee discounts, once there's assured confidence in the chosen methods. Importantly, the enhanced security offered by PQC should be considered an intrinsic incentive, essential to the valuation of any incentive models put forward.

This discourse reflects a proactive stance within the Bitcoin development community, underscoring the importance of preemptive action in the face of evolving technological landscapes. The collective effort towards establishing PQC-secured schemes not only aims to fortify Bitcoin against future quantum computing threats but also illustrates the community's commitment to innovation and security in an ever-changing digital world.</summary>
