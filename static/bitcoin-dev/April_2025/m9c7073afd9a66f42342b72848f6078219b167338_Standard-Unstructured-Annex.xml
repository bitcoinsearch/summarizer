    <summary>In the realm of Bitcoin development, a nuanced distinction exists between inputs having an annex and those without. An input without any annex adheres to the standard status quo, while the presence of an annex, even if it is zero bytes in size, signifies a different state. This rule suggests that if any input within a transaction opts to include an annex, then all inputs part of that transaction are required to do the same. The allowance for an annex of zero bytes serves as a formal mechanism for inputs to express their consent regarding the use of annexes in transactions, which also implicates the consideration of subsequent transaction pinning risks. For further details, Peter Todd's insights can be explored at [his website](https://petertodd.org). This information is pertinent to discussions among members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, highlighting the intricate considerations involved in the evolution of Bitcoin's technical framework.</summary>
