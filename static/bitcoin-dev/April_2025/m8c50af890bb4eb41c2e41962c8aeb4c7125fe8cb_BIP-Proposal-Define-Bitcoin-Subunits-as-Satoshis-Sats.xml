    <title>BIP Proposal: Define Bitcoin Subunits as Satoshis/Sats</title>

    <summary>The email proposes an enhancement focusing on the accessibility features for users of assistive technologies, acknowledging the importance of inclusivity in digital communication and development. It suggests the addition of a section dedicated to *accessibility and voice/UI guidance* within the current proposal framework. This new section aims to address how various aspects should be managed in screen readers, voice assistants, or accessible interfaces to better accommodate users with disabilities. The recommendation includes a detailed example concerning the pronunciation and representation of numerical values, specifically converting "1 sat" into "one satoshi", providing phonetic transcription (/wʌn səˈtoʊʃi/) as guidance for its proper articulation in speech-based technologies.

Furthermore, the email offers assistance in refining this proposed section to ensure it seamlessly integrates with the existing structure, indicating a willingness to collaborate for the enhancement of the proposal's inclusiveness. To support the suggested improvements, links to resources on the International Phonetic Alphabet ([International Phonetic Alphabet](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org)) and a phonetics conversion tool ([tophonetics.com](https://tophonetics.com)) are provided. These resources could serve as foundational elements for developing comprehensive guidelines on accessibility in technology interfaces, thereby fostering an environment that accommodates all users, including those reliant on assistive technologies similar to Hal Finney.</summary>
