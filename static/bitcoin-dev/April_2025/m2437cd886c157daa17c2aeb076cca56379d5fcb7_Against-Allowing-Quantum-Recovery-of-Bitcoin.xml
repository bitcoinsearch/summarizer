    <summary>The discourse surrounding the potential impact of quantum computing on Bitcoin security has elicited a range of propositions, highlighting both the complexity and urgency of the issue at hand. A notable suggestion involves implementing a mechanism to counter quantum attacks, which poses a significant threat to the cryptographic foundations of Bitcoin. The conversation suggests two primary avenues for preemptive action: the adoption of post-quantum signatures and addresses, and the exploration of innovative solutions such as a rolling timeout or a quantum doomsday clock to manage these risks.

The concept of a rolling timeout, as proposed by Murch, introduces an elegant yet potentially complex solution aimed at mitigating quantum threats. This approach, while sophisticated, may present challenges in terms of user comprehension and accessibility, given its intricate nature. On the other hand, the quantum doomsday clock offers a simpler, more intuitive alternative, albeit with the risk of igniting a competitive bidding war among users.

In light of these discussions, there appears to be a consensus on the necessity for Bitcoin to evolve in order to withstand quantum vulnerabilities. This entails the crucial first step of developing and integrating post-quantum cryptographic measures. Among the suggested strategies are the implementation of BIP 360 or the adaptation of Taproot PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography), both of which represent viable paths forward. These measures aim to fortify Bitcoin's cryptographic infrastructure against the looming quantum threat, ensuring its resilience and security in the face of advancing computational capabilities.</summary>
