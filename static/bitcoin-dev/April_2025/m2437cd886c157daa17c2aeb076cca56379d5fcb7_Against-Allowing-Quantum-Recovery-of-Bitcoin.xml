    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the imperative need for the Bitcoin community to address and mitigate potential quantum threats. A prominent suggestion in this discourse is the introduction of post-quantum signatures or addresses as a preventive measure against such futuristic attacks. This conversation highlights two possible solutions to integrate post-quantum resilience within the Bitcoin framework. One proposed method is through BIP 360, though the specifics of this proposal were not detailed in the communication. Alternatively, the implementation of Taproot Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) was mentioned as another viable pathway. 

The dialogue also delves into various strategies to counteract the quantum threat, with opinions diverging on the most effective approach. The concept of a "rolling timeout" introduced by Murch was acknowledged for its innovative approach, yet it was also critiqued for its potential complexity and the challenges it may pose for average users to comprehend. Conversely, the "quantum doomsday clock" was recognized for its simplicity but criticized for possibly inciting a competitive bidding scenario which could complicate matters further.

Overall, the emphasis was on the urgency for the developer community to allocate resources and focus on developing a robust plan that incorporates post-quantum security measures to safeguard Bitcoin against quantum computing advancements. This proactive step is deemed crucial to ensure the longevity and security of Bitcoin in the face of evolving technological threats.</summary>
