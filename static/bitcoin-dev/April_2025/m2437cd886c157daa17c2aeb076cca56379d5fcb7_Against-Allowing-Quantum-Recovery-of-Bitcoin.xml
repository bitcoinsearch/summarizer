    <summary>The ongoing discussions among Bitcoin developers highlight the community's concern regarding quantum attacks and the search for a viable solution to protect the cryptocurrency from such threats. One suggestion is to impose a form of freeze to mitigate these risks, though this approach has its complexities. The concept of a rolling timeout, proposed by Murch, introduces an elegant yet potentially confusing method for users due to its intricate calculations. An alternative idea involves the quantum doomsday clock, which, despite its simplicity, might lead to competitive bidding wars.

A consensus appears to be forming around the need for Bitcoin to adopt post-quantum signatures and addresses as a preemptive measure against quantum vulnerabilities. Advocacy for dedicating development efforts towards this goal is strong, with suggestions pointing towards either the implementation of BIP 360 or the integration of Taproot PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) as potential pathways forward. These measures are viewed as essential steps in ensuring Bitcoin's resilience against quantum computing threats, underscoring the urgency of addressing this challenge within the developer community.</summary>
