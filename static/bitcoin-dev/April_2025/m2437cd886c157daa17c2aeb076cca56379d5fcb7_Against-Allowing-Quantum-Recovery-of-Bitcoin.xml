    <summary>The discussion surrounding the vulnerability of Bitcoin to quantum attacks has brought forth several proposed solutions, highlighting the complexity and urgency of the issue. One suggestion involves implementing a mechanism akin to a rolling timeout, an idea that, while innovative, may present comprehension challenges for the general user base due to its intricate nature. Conversely, the concept of a quantum doomsday clock introduces a simpler approach but raises concerns about potential competitive implications, notably a bidding war scenario.

In addressing the looming threat of quantum computing, there is a consensus on the necessity for Bitcoin to evolve by integrating post-quantum cryptographic solutions. The debate emphasizes the critical need for the developer community to prioritize and allocate resources towards establishing a viable pathway for incorporating post-quantum signatures or addresses into the Bitcoin protocol. Proposals such as BIP 360 and adaptations of Taproot PQC stand out as potential starting points in this endeavor, indicating a proactive stance towards safeguarding Bitcoin against future quantum computational capabilities. This direction underscores the broader imperative for continuous innovation and adaptation within the cryptocurrency sphere to preemptively counter emerging technological challenges.</summary>
