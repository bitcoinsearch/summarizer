    <summary>The ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin development community have shed light on various perspectives regarding the OP_RETURN output and its implications for blockchain's functionality and efficiency. Vojtěch Strnad and Antoine Poinsot have contributed significant insights, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of OP_RETURN for data smaller than 143 bytes. This revelation has sparked a debate on whether the current size limit on OP_RETURN outputs should be maintained or adjusted to accommodate the evolving needs of Bitcoin's protocol and its users.

Strnad highlighted that the existing limit might not be necessary, suggesting that the Bitcoin network has ample capacity for upgrades without risking operational efficiency. Similarly, Poinsot critiqued the standardness rules surrounding OP_RETURN outputs, pointing out that while these rules aim to maintain network integrity, they often result in less efficient data encoding methods and could potentially lead to the proliferation of unspendable transaction outputs.

In a detailed examination, Greg Sanders proposed a dual approach to address the concerns related to OP_RETURN outputs. He suggested dropping the size limit entirely, arguing that arbitrary restrictions do not align with the future vision of a more versatile and efficient blockchain. Sanders also advocated for removing the count restriction on OP_RETURN outputs, emphasizing that without a size limit, there is no practical reason to constrain the number of outputs. This perspective is rooted in the belief that flexibility in transaction compositions could foster innovation and efficiency within the network.

Furthering the discussion, the necessity of revisiting standardness rules was underscored by a consideration of their original purposes: mitigating Denial of Service attacks, facilitating future upgrades, and discouraging undesirable practices. However, the effectiveness of such rules has been questioned, particularly in the context of OP_RETURN outputs. Developers have found creative ways to circumvent these limitations, as exemplified by the Citrea bridge's use of Taproot outputs for data embedding. This scenario illustrates the potential unintended consequences of overly restrictive rules, which may lead to less optimal solutions and practices.

The proposal to eliminate restrictions on OP_RETURN outputs, starting with the removal of the size limit for scriptPubKey, reflects a broader shift towards embracing a more open and adaptable framework for Bitcoin's transactional capabilities. By reconsidering the limitations on the number of OP_RETURN outputs per transaction, developers aim to discourage harmful practices indirectly promoted by the current rules, paving the way for a more innovative and efficient blockchain ecosystem.</summary>
