    <summary>In the discussion around potential improvements to Bitcoin's transaction handling mechanisms, two solutions were proposed by Ruben Somsen. The first solution, referred to as "Solution C," suggests that in cases where a transaction overwrite occurs, the system should treat this overwrite as a spend of the overwritten transaction and restore the previous Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO). This approach essentially reverses the effects of overwriting transactions by reinstating the UTXO that was replaced.

The second proposal, named "Solution D," recommends avoiding the creation of UTXOs at the moment they are first recognized if they are going to be overwritten later. This strategy aims to eliminate the redundancy of creating UTXOs that will not be needed, thus potentially streamlining the process.

However, concerns were raised about the computational efficiency of these solutions. Specifically, the need to check transaction IDs (txids) against a significantly larger data set (7 MB as opposed to 64 bytes) under one of the proposed approaches was highlighted as a drawback. This increase in required CPU time for transaction verification was seen as a disadvantage compared to the current system, suggesting that the existing method might still be preferable despite the exploration of new solutions.</summary>
