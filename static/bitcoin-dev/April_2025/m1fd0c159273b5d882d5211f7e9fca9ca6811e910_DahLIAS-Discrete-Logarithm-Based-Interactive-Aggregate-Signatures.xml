    <title>DahLIAS: Discrete Logarithm-Based Interactive Aggregate Signatures</title>

    <link href="https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/be3813bf-467d-4880-9383-2a0b0223e7e5@gmail.com/T/#m1fd0c159273b5d882d5211f7e9fca9ca6811e910" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>The discussion focuses on the security aspects and optimizations of digital signature schemes, particularly emphasizing the significance of not leaking information. The security theorem for DahLIAS is highlighted, mentioning that an adversary cannot win the unforgeability game unless they solve the discrete logarithm (DL) problem or find a collision in the hash function Hnon. This point underscores the robustness of the scheme against potential attacks, provided the underlying cryptographic assumptions hold.

Further exploration delves into the high-verifiability zero-knowledge (HVZK) property of the Schnorr Identification Scheme, suggesting its possible implications for the Fiat-Shamir transformation through the use of a simulator. Although this topic is acknowledged as a sidetrack from the main focus of the paper, it presents an interesting theoretical consideration.

The conversation also introduces a practical optimization for single-party signers in digital signature protocols. By utilizing secret keys alongside public keys, a signer can perform more efficient computations, reducing the process to a single group multiplication. This optimization not only simplifies the computational process but also highlights the importance of including such enhancements in academic papers. The rationale is that engineers applying these protocols might not fully grasp the security implications of modifications, making it crucial for research to address both the possibility and safety of optimizations.

Finally, the debate touches upon whether such optimizations should be documented within academic papers or Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), arguing for the former. This stance is based on the belief that the relevance of optimizations transcends specific applications like Bitcoin, underscoring their broader applicability and the necessity for thorough academic scrutiny to ensure safety in diverse implementations.</summary>
