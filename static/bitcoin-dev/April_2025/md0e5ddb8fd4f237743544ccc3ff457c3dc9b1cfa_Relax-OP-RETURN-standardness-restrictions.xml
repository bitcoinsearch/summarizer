    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Sjors Provoost brought up an insightful suggestion regarding the limitations associated with OP_Return outputs within the Bitcoin protocol. Provoost advocated for the removal of both existing limits simultaneously, highlighting the technical and financial inefficiencies that currently plague the system. He pointed out that although having multiple OP_Return outputs for transferring the same amount of data is more costly than utilizing a single output, there are indispensable technical scenarios where this approach becomes necessary. One notable example provided was the necessity of multiple outputs when signing transactions with SIGHASH_SINGLE. This method allows for a more flexible transaction signing process, accommodating various use cases that the current limitations hinder. Further information and discussions on this topic can be explored through Peter Toddâ€™s insights available at [Peter Todd's website](https://petertodd.org).

This proposal underlines a critical aspect of ongoing debates within the Bitcoin development community, focusing on optimizing the blockchain's functionality while maintaining or enhancing security protocols. By considering adjustments to the OP_Return output limitations, developers aim to achieve a more efficient and versatile system capable of supporting a broader range of operations without compromising the integrity of the network.</summary>
