    <summary>The discussion centers on the exploration and analysis of FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity) and STARKs (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge) within the quantum oracle model. Two significant works have been highlighted to underline the current advancements and research findings in this area. The first work, accessible through the link [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.05360](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.05360), delves into the foundational principles and implementations of these cryptographic protocols within a quantum framework. Similarly, the second work, found at [https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS52979.2021.00014](https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS52979.2021.00014), provides an in-depth examination of how these technologies perform under the scrutiny of quantum computing models, offering insights into their durability, efficiency, and potential future applications.

This conversation is part of a broader discourse among members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, indicating a keen interest in the ramifications of quantum computing on blockchain technology and cryptography. By focusing on FRI and STARKs, the discussion underscores the importance of developing quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols to ensure the security and integrity of blockchain-based systems in the face of evolving computational capabilities. This area of research is crucial for the advancement of secure digital transactions and the broader application of blockchain technology in various industries.</summary>
