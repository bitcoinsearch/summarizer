    <summary>The dialogue around securing Bitcoin against potential quantum attacks has led to various proposals, with the community gravitating towards complex yet potentially effective solutions. One suggestion involves introducing a mechanism known as a rolling timeout, which, while theoretically appealing for its dynamism, might pose comprehension challenges for the average user. This complexity contrasts with the more straightforward, albeit competitively fraught, concept of a quantum doomsday clock. Amidst these discussions, there's a consensus on the necessity for Bitcoin to evolve by integrating post-quantum cryptographic capabilities. Specifically, the conversation highlights the urgency in adopting new standards that could safeguard Bitcoin from quantum vulnerabilities. Proposals such as BIP 360 and adaptations of Taproot PQC are under consideration, signaling the community's proactive stance on this matter. These developments underscore a critical phase in Bitcoin's evolution, where adapting to post-quantum cryptography is not just an option but a necessity to ensure its resilience against emerging technological threats.</summary>
