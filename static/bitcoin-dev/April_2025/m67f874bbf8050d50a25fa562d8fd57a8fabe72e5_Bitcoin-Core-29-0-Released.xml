    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 29.0 has been officially released, available for download at [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-29.0/). This new version introduces several features, improvements in performance, and various bug fixes alongside updated translations. Users encountering issues are encouraged to use the GitHub issue tracker provided at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues) and can join the mailing list for announcements [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).

For those upgrading from an older version, it's important to shut down the previous version completely before initiating the upgrade process. The upgrade procedure varies slightly depending on the operating system: Windows users will run the installer, macOS users should copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt`, and Linux users will replace `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt`. Direct upgrades from versions that have reached their end of life (EOL) are supported, but may require additional time if data migration is necessary. Compatibility is not guaranteed for unsupported systems, although Bitcoin Core does run on most Unix-like systems beyond its officially tested Linux Kernel 3.17+, macOS 13+, and Windows 10+ environments.

Significant changes in this release include adjustments to P2P and network configurations, such as the removal of UPnP support in favor of `-natpmp`, which offers IPv4 port forwarding and IPv6 pinholing capabilities. Additionally, improvements to orphan transaction handling aim to increase bandwidth usage efficiency and reliability. The introduction of ephemeral dust in transactions allows for zero-fee transactions containing a single dust output, provided it is spent simultaneously with its creation. A notable fix in mining involves the correction of a double reservation error in block reserved weight, now accurately set with a new `-blockreservedweight` startup option.

RPC updates enhance functionality and developer interaction. For example, `testmempoolaccept` now includes a `reject-details` field, and `getmininginfo` returns more detailed information about the current and next block targets. New RPCs like `getdescriptoractivity` improve the utility of Bitcoin Core for developers by streamlining the tracking of spend/receive activity within specified blocks.

The REST APIs have been updated to return the current target in the `target` field for both block and header requests. Configuration settings see various alterations, such as the deprecation of `-mempoolfullrbf` in favor of a standard full replace-by-fee behavior and limitations on the `-dbcache` maximum value due to UTXO set growth. Notably, the build system transitioned from Autotools to CMake, introducing new requirements and defaults that developers must note, such as the necessity to specify build options directly and adherence to the minimum required CMake version of 3.22.

This release also mentions low-level changes including tools conversion and test network adjustments, alongside the removal of certain dependencies like MiniUPnPc and libnatpmp. Credit for this release is extended to numerous contributors who played various roles in its development, underlining the collaborative effort behind Bitcoin Core's ongoing refinement.

For detailed building instructions and configuration guidance, the official [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) and the project's own platform-specific build guides should be consulted.</summary>
