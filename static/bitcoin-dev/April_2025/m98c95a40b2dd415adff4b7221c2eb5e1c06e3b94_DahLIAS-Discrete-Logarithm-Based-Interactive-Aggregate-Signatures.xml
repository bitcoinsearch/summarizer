    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a query was raised by AdamISZ, also known as waxwing, regarding the DahLIA algorithm's specific operational choice. The question centered on the rationale behind selecting R2 over R1 (or potentially both) as a verification mechanism within the algorithm's structure. Waxwing inquired whether this choice was driven by a need for optimization or if it stemmed from the practicality of requiring only one check for the algorithm's functionality. This discussion highlights a technical exploration into the workings of the DahLIA algorithm, shedding light on the intricacies involved in its design and implementation choices.</summary>
