    <summary>Anthony Casciano recently inquired about the status of Matt Corallo's &quot;BetterHash&quot; BIP through the bitcoin-dev mailing list. In his message, Casciano expressed his belief that the implementation should be put into production sooner rather than later and requested a second opinion. However, it is important to note that the decision to put things into production ultimately relies on people choosing to adopt them.Unfortunately, the context does not provide specific details or updates regarding the &quot;BetterHash&quot; BIP. It is unclear what kind of information Casciano was seeking. Nonetheless, those interested in contributing to the implementation of the BIP can do so by visiting the GitHub repository at https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/mining-proxy.</summary>
