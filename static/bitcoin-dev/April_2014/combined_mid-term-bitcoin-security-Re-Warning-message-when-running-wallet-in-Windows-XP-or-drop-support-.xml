    <summary>In an email exchange on April 16th, 2014, Adam Back proposed rebranding Bitcoin addresses as &quot;invoice numbers&quot; to prevent double payments. This suggestion was supported by Jeff Garzik, who pointed out that BitPay already uses similar language. The discussion then shifted towards the need for enhanced security measures, such as air-gaps and zero-trust ecosystems.The author of the email thread emphasized the importance of online privacy and encouraged the use of email encryption whenever possible. They also suggested several security measures, including real-time auditability, type 2/type 3 exchanges based on atomic-swap, trustless escrow, and mass production of trezors.Address substitution via an untrusted network/user and a weak site with 1 million lines of Swiss-cheese security app-store was identified as a potential issue. To address this, the author recommended address authentication using the Trust-On-First-Use (TOFU) approach. They proposed a simple native TOFU format, such as Alan Reiner's multiplier * base approach or the IBE address proposal.The discussion concluded with a debate about whether XP with a Trezor would work fine and the consideration of dropping XP support in the next major release. Overall, the email exchange covered various topics related to Bitcoin addresses, security measures, and the importance of online privacy.</summary>
