    <summary>In an email exchange on April 21, 2014, Rodney Morris raised a question about the proper procedure for handling situations where someone quotes an entire digest for the sake of a few lines of content. He further questioned whether this behavior could be classified as abuse and whether others were bothered by it. The specific mailing list or forum to which this email was sent is not specified.Wladimir responded to Rodney's query, stating that he would not categorize this behavior as abuse unless it was done intentionally. Instead of publicly complaining on the mailing list, Wladimir suggested privately asking the person involved about their quoting practices. By addressing the issue personally, it would provide an opportunity for clarification and understanding.Acknowledging Wladimir's feedback, Rodney expressed his gratitude for the response and explained that he noticed this issue more frequently due to primarily accessing the list on a mobile device. It is evident that Rodney sought guidance on how to handle the situation effectively and was open to understanding different perspectives on the matter.Overall, the email exchange highlights Rodney's concern about the practice of quoting an entire digest for only a few lines of content. Wladimir's response emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue privately with the individual involved rather than resorting to public complaints. Rodney's acknowledgment of the feedback and explanation of his own circumstances further adds context to the discussion.</summary>
