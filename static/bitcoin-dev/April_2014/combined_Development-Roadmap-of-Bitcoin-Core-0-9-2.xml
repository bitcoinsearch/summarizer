    <summary>Tails 1.1, based on Wheezy, is set to release on June 10th according to an email exchange between Kristov Atlas and Wladimir. The release date was confirmed by a link to the Tails website. Tails is a live operating system designed for privacy and anonymity while using the internet. It is based on Debian GNU/Linux and can be run from a USB drive, DVD, or SD card. Tails 1.1 promises to include enhancements and bug fixes, with improved security features and performance.In another email exchange, Wladimir and Warren Togami Jr. discuss the need for a cut-off point regarding the use of old stable distributions on the desktop. Warren suggests using 4.7 or 4.8 as the cut-off point, as Qt 4.6, which is currently used by Tails, is considered ancient. They also discuss the compatibility of Bitcoin-Qt on different systems, including Tails, which is a mostly stateless Linux distribution for privacy applications. Building Bitcoin-Qt from source in Tails is not straightforward due to the lack of development tools. The group discusses possible solutions, such as building against the 4.6 Qt headers instead of statically building, which may result in the loss of some GUI features but could improve compatibility.Gregory Maxwell also joins the conversation and suggests that Tails users usually cannot build Bitcoin-Qt from source. He mentions the idea of having a separate static QT binary just for these cases. Warren agrees that statically linking QT on Linux should generally be avoided due to theming issues. They suggest that the build process could dump out a separate extra static QT binary, which would require less maintenance than addressing questions and complaints about it.Warren Togami Jr. and Kristov Atlas discuss the compatibility of the latest nightly build with Tails/Debian Squeeze in an email exchange. Warren clarifies that while bitcoind works on most distributions, bitcoin-qt may not work due to qt-4.6. He emphasizes the priority of making bitcoind work on as many distributions as possible, as older stable distributions are typically headless. Building Bitcoin-Qt from source is the only option for users who need it on an incompatible system. Kristov points out that Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.6 works fine on Tails and suggests building in Debian Squeeze and transplanting that, highlighting the importance of supporting Tails as a Linux distribution.Warren also posts on the Bitcoin-Translators mailing list, suggesting developers communicate with translators when new translations are needed. The Bitcoin Core developers plan to release version 0.9.2, focusing on bug fixes and translation updates. The development roadmap includes a feature and string freeze starting in three weeks from the date of the announcement. Non-developers and translators can get involved in testing unofficial deterministic nightly builds. Transifex is used to coordinate translations, with English language source strings synchronized periodically. A String Freeze will be declared prior to the release to allow translators enough time to translate new or modified source strings. Laanwj proposes a strategy for dealing with future releases where translations for both diverged stable and master branches can be kept simultaneously in Transifex.</summary>
