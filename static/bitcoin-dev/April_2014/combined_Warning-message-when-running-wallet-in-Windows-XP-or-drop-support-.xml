    <summary>There were discussions within the Bitcoin community about the security and support of Windows XP as a platform for Bitcoin Core. It was noted that Windows XP was no longer considered secure enough, especially for internet banking and running Bitcoin wallets. Microsoft had ended support for XP, leaving it vulnerable to known remote root compromises and other threats.The discussion included suggestions for warning users about the risks of using an outdated operating system and implementing added security measures such as hardware security modules or multisig secured wallets. Some argued that it didn't make sense to support an OS platform that Microsoft no longer supported themselves. Others believed that it was safe to run Bitcoin Core as a full node on XP, but caution should be taken when using the wallet functionality.The discussion also raised concerns about potential warnings being seen as behavior modification tactics and comparisons were made to Apple's practices of invalidating accessories with software updates. Overall, the importance of security and careful consideration in the development of cryptocurrency technologies was emphasized.During a discussion among Bitcoin developers, the security of running Bitcoin wallets on Windows XP was raised as a concern. Microsoft had stopped providing security patches for XP, leaving it vulnerable to remote exploits. Even banks were warning customers against using XP for online banking due to its lack of security. The question arose whether Bitcoin wallet software should drop support for XP, potentially compromising the network's security. However, there was hesitation as many computers in China and Russia still used XP, and dropping support could result in a loss of nodes.In an email exchange, Kevin questioned the security of XP and mentioned a warning. It was confirmed that Windows XP is no longer maintained and should not be used to safeguard money. Microsoft had issued a warning on their website regarding the end of support for XP. A suggestion was made to have Bitcoin Core detect when running on XP and warn users about the associated risks.On the Bitcoin-development mailing list, Wladimir expressed concern about the security of running a Bitcoin wallet on XP. He noted that his bank warned against doing internet banking on XP and questioned whether it was safe to store wallet keys on the outdated operating system. The discussion revolved around whether to warn users and allow them to continue or redirect them to a message on bitcoin.org highlighting the dangers of using XP. Dropping XP support completely could lead to a decrease in nodes, particularly in countries like China and Russia where XP was still widely used. Other wallet software maintainers were also asked about their plans regarding XP support.In an email exchange between Melvin Carvalho and Wladimir, the issue of using XP with a Trezor hardware wallet was discussed. Wladimir stated that this was a rare case since security-conscious individuals who purchased a Trezor would not use XP. However, he acknowledged that malware could still compromise users even with a Trezor on an XP system. Wladimir proposed adding a warning message in the 0.9.2 release, urging users to upgrade to a more secure operating system like Windows 8.1. He also suggested dropping XP support entirely in the next major release, 0.10.0.In summary, the security of using Windows XP for online banking and Bitcoin wallet storage was questioned due to Microsoft's discontinuation of support. Suggestions were made to warn users about the risks or redirect them to a message on bitcoin.org. However, dropping XP support completely could result in a loss of nodes, especially in China and Russia. The decision to drop XP support was not finalized, and other wallet software maintainers were considering their options as well.</summary>
