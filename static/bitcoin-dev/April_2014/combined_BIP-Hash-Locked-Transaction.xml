    <summary>In April 2014, Jorge Timón proposed a change to the &quot;IsStandard&quot; script, suggesting replacing the &quot;AcceptToMemoryPool&quot; function with an &quot;IsStandard(scriptPubKey, scriptSig)&quot; method. The proposal aimed to simplify the standard script check process by checking for pattern matches. The idea of implementing a generic Policy interface that extends to StandardPolicy was also discussed, which would allow miners to implement their own policies without starting from scratch. Peter Todd and Tier Nolan discussed Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), with Todd suggesting examining how the isStandard() rules could be removed instead of creating new format-specific types. Todd proposed a whitelist of low-risk opcodes as a compromise. Todd acknowledged that removing isStandard() would be a bigger change than adding one new type. Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd discussed the implementation of oracles in transactions. They suggested using EC public points instead of hash-locked transactions for oracles. This approach allows the oracle to prove ownership by signing a challenge message and conceals the purpose of the oracle from itself. Maxwell proposed a BIP to examine the possibility of removing the IsStandard() rules. Sigops and Luke-Jr's accept non-standard patch were also mentioned in the discussion.Peter Todd discussed his research on implementing oracles in blockchain transactions, suggesting that using ECC secret keys revealed by the oracle is a better method than hash-locked transactions. The transaction can include keys derived from the oracle keys, blinding the oracle to the purposes it is being used for. The use of EC public points for oracles was agreed upon, and Reality Keys was referenced as an example.Alex Mizrahi suggested an approach where an oracle associates a hash with each possible outcome and reveals a preimage to unlock the transaction. Peter Todd noted that revealing ECC secret keys works better in every case except for larger transactions.On April 25, 2014, Luke-Jr commented on a BIP, expressing that he thought it was useless and could not be made secure. The BIP involved hash locking to release the coin on another chain. Luke-Jr clarified that the hash locking is required for the particular protocol.Tier Nolan proposed a new system for atomic cross-chain transfers, involving hash-locking outputs where a user needs to provide x corresponding to hash(x) to spend an output. This system would link two chains together. Nolan suggested embedding this system into a P2SH output as an add-on to standard transactions. Luke expressed skepticism about the proposal, stating that he believed it couldn't be made secure.</summary>
