    <summary>The bitcoin-dev mailing list is currently discussing whether a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) should be proposed for the automated and secure communication used in Soroban, a project by Samourai wallet. While some members argue that this is not directly related to improving the Bitcoin protocol, others, including Ben from Square Crypto, believe that a BIP would be appropriate. Prayank, the original poster, suggests that such a BIP could benefit other Bitcoin projects like joinmarket, coinswap, snickr, etc., as anything facilitating coordination between different programs is considered BIP material. Prayank provides links to the client library in Java and the server component in Go for those interested in the technical details of Soroban.Although Samourai, a Bitcoin wallet provider, has declined to propose a BIP for the Soroban communication system, citing its lack of impact on the Bitcoin protocol and the mailing list's unsuitability for writing a specification, Prayank seeks opinions on potential interest in a BIP. Despite past controversies surrounding Samourai, Prayank emphasizes the importance of putting aside differences and focusing on what benefits Bitcoin. Furthermore, a medium article linked in the post highlights the potential benefits of Soroban for other projects such as joinmarket, coinswap, and snickr.In addition, Prayank has shared the source code for the Soroban client library in Java and the Go-based server component, which can be accessed through the provided links. Prayank requests assistance from anyone willing to help create a BIP for implementing Soroban in other Bitcoin projects.Prayank has also taken the discussion to Reddit, seeking opinions on whether there is enough interest in proposing a BIP related to Soroban's automated and secure communication. Despite previous controversies involving Samourai, Prayank emphasizes the importance of prioritizing actions that benefit Bitcoin. The potential benefits of a BIP for other Bitcoin projects, as mentioned in the medium article linked by Prayank, are also highlighted. Additionally, the Samourai team has tweeted their lack of interest in proposing a Soroban-related BIP, while Ben from Square Crypto has expressed support for such a proposal. Prayank provides links to the source code for the Java client library and Go-based server component and invites assistance in creating a BIP for this implementation.</summary>
