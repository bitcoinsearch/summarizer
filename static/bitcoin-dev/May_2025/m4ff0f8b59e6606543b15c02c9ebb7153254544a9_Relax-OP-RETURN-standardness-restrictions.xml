    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Greg Maxwell addressed concerns regarding the adoption of new versions of Bitcoin Core and their compatibility with existing systems. He clarified that there is no urgency in upgrading to newer versions of the software, indicating flexibility in maintaining system stability by potentially downgrading when necessary. This approach suggests a pragmatic and cautious stance towards software updates within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Maxwell also shed light on a specific case involving Wasabi, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. Contrary to assumptions, Wasabi was utilizing Bitcoin Knots, which had enabled full replace-by-fee (RBF) before Bitcoin Core did. The Wasabi team addressed an issue related to this by temporarily disabling the feature, making necessary code adjustments, and then re-enabling it. This incident underscores the adaptability and problem-solving capabilities of developers working within the Bitcoin network infrastructure.

Furthermore, Maxwell dismissed concerns about the potential impact of removing datacarrier on transactions, particularly those involving oversized OP_Return outputs. He argued that such scenarios are unlikely to pose significant problems, as the system regularly processes transactions with oversized OP_Returns without issue. His comments suggest confidence in the robustness of the Bitcoin network's handling of transactions and skepticism towards dedicating extensive resources to highly hypothetical or unlikely issues.
