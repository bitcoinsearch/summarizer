    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, shared by Sjors via a [Google Groups link](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uUK6py0Yjq0/m/bQk2v0E5BQAJ), an interesting technical observation was brought to light concerning the nature of scriptPubKey seen on the blockchain and its relation to NUMS (Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve) points. Initially, it was suggested that the scriptPubKey observable in transactions directly represents a NUMS point. However, this assumption was corrected by pointing out a crucial detail: while the internal key associated with a transaction might indeed be a NUMS point, it undergoes a modification process known as tweaking.

The core of the clarification lies in the behavior of this tweaked key when it is used in a transaction. Specifically, even though the key is spent, the tweak— the modification applied to the original NUMS point—remains undisclosed. Consequently, this obscurity ensures that observers, including the blockchain itself, cannot definitively ascertain whether a NUMS point was involved in the transaction. This nuance adds a layer of complexity to understanding the mechanics behind how NUMS points interact with blockchain technology, especially in the context of privacy and security features inherent in cryptographic practices. The dialogue underscores a detailed technical subtlety in blockchain's handling of cryptographic keys and raises intriguing considerations for developers and researchers focused on blockchain technology.</summary>
