    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a concept was brought to attention regarding the visibility of Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) points within blockchain transactions. Initially, it was suggested that NUMS points could be identified directly through the scriptPubKey seen on the blockchain. However, this understanding was corrected by highlighting a crucial aspect of how these points are utilized in practice.

The core of the clarification revolves around the internal key used in transactions, which indeed is a NUMS point. However, this key undergoes a modification process known as 'tweaking' before being included in a transaction. This tweaking of the internal key serves a specific purpose but carries an implication for transparency and traceability. When a transaction using a tweaked NUMS point is executed, the tweak—essentially a modification applied to the original NUMS point—is not disclosed within the transaction details available on the blockchain. This absence of the tweak's visibility ensures that, despite the use of NUMS points in constructing transactions, observers cannot conclusively determine their involvement based solely on the information recorded on the blockchain.

This discovery or clarification has implications for both the technical understanding and potential surveillance mechanisms within Bitcoin's blockchain. It underscores a privacy-preserving characteristic inherent in the design of certain cryptographic elements employed within Bitcoin transactions. The conversation, detailed by Sjors on the [Bitcoin Development Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uUK6py0Yjq0/m/bQk2v0E5BQAJ), enriches the ongoing dialogue about the balance between transparency and privacy in the realm of cryptocurrency.</summary>
