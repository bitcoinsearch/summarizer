    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, an interesting point was raised regarding the use of Nothing-Up-My-Sleeve (NUMS) points within Bitcoin's scriptPubKey. Initially, it was suggested that the presence of NUMS points could be identified directly on the blockchain. However, this notion was corrected by indicating that what is visible on the chain is not the NUMS point itself but rather a tweaked version of the internal key. The key point highlighted is that when these tweaked keys are used in transactions, the specific tweak applied is not disclosed in the transaction details. This lack of visibility ensures that it remains uncertain whether a NUMS point was involved in the transaction, making it impossible for the blockchain to detect and subsequently block such spends.

This clarification emerged from a conversation on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, underscoring a nuanced understanding of how NUMS points interact with Bitcoin's protocol. The distinction between the internal NUMS point and its tweaked counterpart as seen in transactions underscores the complexity of ensuring privacy and security within the blockchain. The technical discussion reinforces the challenges in tracking or regulating the use of NUMS points in transactions, given the cryptographic techniques employed to mask their involvement. 

For further information and insights on this topic, the original discussion can be explored through the [Bitcoin Development Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/uUK6py0Yjq0/m/bQk2v0E5BQAJ).</summary>
