    <summary>BIP-93, also known as codex32, is a protocol designed to support both human and computer-generated randomness. This versatility extends to its capability for managing secret sharing, accommodating the needs for security in diverse applications. The integration of human and computer elements in randomness generation and secret sharing underscores the protocol's flexibility and broad utility. For further details on how codex32 facilitates these processes, more information can be found at [secretcodex32.com](https://secretcodex32.com/). This protocol's development and discussion take place within the context of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, indicating its relevance to cryptocurrency technologies and their ongoing evolution.</summary>
