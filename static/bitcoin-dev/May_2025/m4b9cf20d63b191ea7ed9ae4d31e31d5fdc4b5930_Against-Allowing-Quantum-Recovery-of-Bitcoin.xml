    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion initiates with a concern about the legal implications of developers making intentional code changes that could potentially confiscate funds, despite providing a reasonable warning period. It raises the question of whether such actions could lead to developers being held legally responsible for any resultant losses. This concern stems from the awareness that Bitcoin has previously faced legal challenges, and there's apprehension about exposing developers to significant personal liability, especially in scenarios involving substantial amounts of money.

Another aspect covered is the proposal to mitigate risk by limiting the impact of these changes to funds that are likely already lost. The suggestion includes excluding UTXOs that might be subject to timelocks (such as P2SH/P2WSH) and focusing on UTXOs that haven't been moved for an extended period (15-20 years). This approach aims to reduce potential legal and ethical dilemmas by targeting funds presumed abandoned or irrecoverable.

Furthermore, the conversation touches upon the readiness for quantum computing attacks against Bitcoin, emphasizing the necessity to disable transactions to non-post-quantum cryptography (PQC) addresses immediately upon the confirmation of quantum computers capable of compromising Bitcoin's security. Nevertheless, it acknowledges the principle of self-responsibility within the permissionless nature of Bitcoin. It points out that while developers can caution against the use of non-PQC addresses post the availability and suspected imminent threat of practical quantum attacks, it ultimately falls on users to heed this advice rather than being forcibly prevented from using such addresses.

This discourse is encapsulated within the broader context of evolving cryptographic standards to safeguard Bitcoin against future technological advancements, highlighting the delicate balance between innovation, user autonomy, and legal considerations. The use of [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home) for secure communication underlines the emphasis on privacy and security within the cryptocurrency development community.</summary>
