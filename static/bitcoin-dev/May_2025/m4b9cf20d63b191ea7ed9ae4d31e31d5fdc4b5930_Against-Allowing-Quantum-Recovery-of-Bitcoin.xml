    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the complex and sensitive issue of introducing code changes in Bitcoin to address potential threats from quantum computing. The primary concern highlighted is the legal ramifications that developers might face if they implement a code change leading to the confiscation of funds, even with prior notification. This concern stems from the understanding that Bitcoin has previously been the target of legal challenges, raising worries about the possibility of exposing developers to significant legal liabilities, potentially amounting to several billion dollars. This risk is particularly acute if a "bonded courier" were to emerge, presenting a private key that could access funds under the original, pre-quantum computing (QC) protective scheme, thereby questioning the legality and ethics of such preventative measures.

The email suggests a cautious approach to mitigating quantum computing threats, emphasizing that any protective measures should only impact funds presumed to be already lost. For instance, it proposes that changes should not affect Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) that could be subject to timelocks or those that have been inactive for an extended period, suggesting a threshold of 15-20 years. This strategy aims to minimize the risk of inadvertently penalizing legitimate users or entangling developers in legal issues while attempting to safeguard the network against quantum attacks.

Moreover, the message touches on the broader implications of operating within a permissionless system like Bitcoin, where the principle of self-responsibility is paramount. It implies that while developers can make Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) addresses available and advise against the use of non-PQC addresses once practical quantum attacks become a tangible threat, the responsibility ultimately falls on the users. They must decide whether to transition to PQC addresses, acknowledging the risks of continuing to use outdated ones. This stance underscores the delicate balance between guiding the community towards safer practices and respecting the autonomous nature of user decisions within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
