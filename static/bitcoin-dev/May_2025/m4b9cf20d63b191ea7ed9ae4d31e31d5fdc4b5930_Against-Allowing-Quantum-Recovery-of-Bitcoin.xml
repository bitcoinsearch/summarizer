    <summary>The email from ArmchairCryptologist raises crucial concerns regarding proposed changes in Bitcoin's code, particularly focusing on the legal ramifications of a decision to confiscate funds through code alterations. The sender emphasizes the importance of considering the potential for significant legal challenges that developers might face if they proceed with changes enabling the confiscation of funds. This concern is grounded in the premise that, despite providing adequate notice to users, the act of deliberately modifying code to seize assets could legally implicate developers, exposing them to liability for losses incurred by users. Such a scenario is not far-fetched given Bitcoin's history of legal scrutiny and the hypothetical situation where a previously inaccessible private key becomes available, potentially unlocking substantial funds under the old scheme.

Furthermore, the discussion delves into how this issue could be navigated more safely. One suggestion is to limit the impact of these changes to Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) that are highly likely to be unrecoverable, specifically excluding those which could be subject to timelocks or have been inactive for an extensive period, such as 15-20 years. This approach aims to minimize the risk of unjustly confiscating recoverable assets while acknowledging the inevitability of advancements in quantum computing. Quantum computing poses a theoretical threat to Bitcoin's security, necessitating disablement of transactions to non-Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) addresses once practical quantum attacks become feasible.

ArmchairCryptologist also touches on the principle of self-responsibility inherent in a permissionless system like Bitcoin. The argument made is that while developers can make PQC addresses available and warn against the use of vulnerable addresses, the ultimate choice and responsibility lie with the users. This stance highlights the balance between offering protections against emerging threats and respecting the autonomy of users within the ecosystem.

For secure communication, the email utilizes [Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail/home), underscoring the sender's emphasis on privacy and security.</summary>
