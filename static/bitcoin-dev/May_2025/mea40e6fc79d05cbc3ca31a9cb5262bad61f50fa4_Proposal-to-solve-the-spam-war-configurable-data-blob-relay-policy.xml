    <summary>Dave Scotese discusses the integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) with Citrea to address recovery from invalid protocol states within Bitcoin's Layer 2 networks. He illustrates how Citrea-compatible nodes bear the responsibility of validating data, with Bitcoin's underlying infrastructure merely facilitating data distribution. This approach underscores an evolving strategy where the validation process is decentralized among nodes, enhancing security and efficiency.

Scotese also proposes the addition of a new relay service designed to disseminate data that has been verifiably committed to using OP_RETURN transactions. This proposal suggests that such a service would not overly burden the Layer 2 (L2) protocol, given its adoption by a significant number of nodes. The incentive for nodes to adopt this relay service lies in the benefits it offers them, ensuring they likely have the necessary data cached by the time transactions are confirmed.

Moreover, he speculates on the viability of the system based on the assumption that L2 protocols would operate a sufficient number of relays. The differentiation between ephemeral caching of arbitrary data and the permanent storage of monetary data is highlighted as a key driver for many node operators to adopt this new relay service. Such a segregation aligns with broader incentives for maintaining the network's integrity and efficiency.</summary>
