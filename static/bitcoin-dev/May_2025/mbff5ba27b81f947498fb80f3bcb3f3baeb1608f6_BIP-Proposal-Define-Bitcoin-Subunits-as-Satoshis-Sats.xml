    <summary>In the realm of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), the addition of accessibility and voice/UI guidance stands as a crucial enhancement. Lucas's suggestion to incorporate such features finds support with an open-source resource provided by the Bitcoin Design community. This resource, dedicated to the finer points of designing products within the Bitcoin ecosystem, covers units and symbols comprehensively. It can be accessed through the following [link](https://bitcoin.design/guide/designing-products/units-and-symbols/). This guide is aimed at enriching the BIPs by ensuring they are more accessible and user-friendly, addressing a significant aspect of cryptocurrency's broader adoption and usability.</summary>
