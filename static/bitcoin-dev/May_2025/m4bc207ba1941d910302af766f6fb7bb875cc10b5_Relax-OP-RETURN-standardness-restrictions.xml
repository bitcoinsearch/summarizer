    <summary>In the discussion about the propagation of non-standard transactions by big miners, several key points emerge regarding the dynamics and potential consequences within the Bitcoin network. The practice allows these miners to ensure their blocks are propagated early, thus avoiding delays in block processing. However, this strategy comes with its risks, particularly in terms of fee sniping by other miners. When a miner propagates a transaction early, it becomes possible for others to include that transaction in their own blocks, thereby claiming the on-chain fees that would have otherwise gone to the initial miner.

This situation could lead to an increase in the use of out-of-band fees as miners seek alternative ways to compensate for the loss of on-chain fees. Out-of-band fees refer to payments made directly between parties, outside the blockchain, to ensure transactions are included in upcoming blocks. This method circumvents the issue of fee sniping but introduces an attribution problem, making it difficult to verify the service provided by miners in spreading the transaction.

The concept of weak blocks—blocks that do not get included in the blockchain but serve as evidence of a miner's effort to propagate a transaction—is also discussed. While weak blocks can serve as proof of service, their effectiveness and utility are debated. They may be beneficial within the context of individual mining pools, especially those that are small and well-connected, as they can demonstrate the work done by miners. However, for the global system at large, the integration of weak blocks poses challenges. Their utility might be limited unless they are linked in a chain, similar to the structure used in p2pool, a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool that allows miners to collaborate in block production.

Overall, the conversation highlights the complexity of transaction propagation strategies among miners and raises important considerations about the implications for the broader Bitcoin network. These include the balance between ensuring timely block propagation and the potential for fee loss, as well as the exploration of alternative mechanisms like out-of-band fees and the strategic use of weak blocks within mining pools.</summary>
