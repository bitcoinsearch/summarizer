    <summary>The QRAMP proposal, discussed within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, outlines a strategic approach to transition Bitcoin's security infrastructure in response to quantum computing threats. This initiative is designed to preserve Bitcoin’s foundational principles while mitigating potential vulnerabilities exposed by quantum advancements. The proposed strategy unfolds in three distinct phases, each crafted to ensure a smooth and voluntary transition for users and developers alike.

In its initial phase, QRAMP suggests the optional inclusion of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys within Taproot outputs. This early adoption phase is crucial as it offers users the choice to enhance their security without imposing mandatory changes. Following this, the proposal recommends the announcement of a soft fork aimed at disabling scripts susceptible to quantum attacks. Importantly, this phase introduces a generous grace period, approximately four years, allowing ample time for stakeholders to adjust without experiencing abrupt disruptions. This thoughtful approach underscores the proposal's commitment to gradual change, minimizing potential shocks to the system.

The final stage of QRAMP involves the careful deactivation of vulnerable outputs, which will be determined based on factors such as age or inactivity. This methodical process benefits from allowing certain exceptions through proof-of-possession, ensuring that users are not unduly penalized. Moreover, the proposal includes provisions to postpone restrictions on timelocked outputs, thereby safeguarding the interests of future spenders. By prioritizing adaptability and user autonomy, QRAMP distinguishes itself as a forward-thinking framework aimed at enhancing Bitcoin’s resilience against quantum threats without resorting to drastic measures of control or confiscation.</summary>
