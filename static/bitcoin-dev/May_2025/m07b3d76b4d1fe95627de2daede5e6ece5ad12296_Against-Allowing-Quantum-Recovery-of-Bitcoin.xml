    <summary>The QRAMP proposal, as discussed in recent correspondences within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, presents a structured approach to navigate the transition into quantum-resistant mechanisms for Bitcoin, ensuring the network's core principles remain intact. The proposal unfolds in three strategic phases aimed at integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) keys into Bitcoin's infrastructure without imposing it mandatorily. Initially, it suggests permitting wallets to optionally include PQC keys in Taproot outputs, fostering early adoption on a voluntary basis.

Progressing further, QRAMP advocates for the announcement of a soft fork designed to phase out scripts vulnerable to quantum attacks. This phase includes a generous grace period of approximately four years, allowing users sufficient time for migration and minimizing abrupt disruptions to the network. Moreover, the proposal outlines a methodical deactivation of susceptible outputs, considering factors such as age or inactivity, to ensure a smooth transition. This gradual approach is complemented by the possibility of exemptions through proof-of-possession, alongside delayed restrictions on timelocked outputs to protect future transactions.

Central to QRAMP’s philosophy is the avoidance of any form of asset confiscation or control over user funds. Instead, the initiative emphasizes aligning incentives, bolstering security, and clarifying the path forward with a non-coercive upgrade strategy. This thoughtful and phased plan underscores a commitment to maintaining Bitcoin’s foundational principles while proactively addressing the emerging challenges posed by quantum computing advancements.</summary>
