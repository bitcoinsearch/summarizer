    <summary>The QRAMP proposal, introduced to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, presents a structured approach to ensure the Bitcoin network's smooth transition into quantum resistance. This initiative is detailed through a three-phase strategy aimed at preserving the fundamental principles of Bitcoin while addressing the potential threats posed by quantum computing advancements.

In the first phase, the proposal suggests allowing Bitcoin wallets the option to include Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys within Taproot outputs. This measure is designed to encourage early adoption of quantum-resistant measures without imposing mandatory changes on users, thus respecting individual preferences and the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin.

The second phase involves the announcement of a soft fork dedicated to disabling scripts that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To minimize disruption, this phase includes a proposed long grace period of approximately four years. This extended timeframe is intended to provide users with sufficient opportunity to migrate to safer protocols, thereby ensuring a stable and gradual transition without exposing the network to abrupt vulnerabilities.

Finally, the third phase focuses on the gradual deactivation of vulnerable outputs, considering factors such as age and inactivity. By avoiding an immediate and rigid cutoff, this approach aims to facilitate adaptation over time. Additionally, the proposal mentions the possibility of making exceptions through proof-of-possession and suggests delaying restrictions on timelocked outputs to protect future transactions from unintended consequences.

Crucially, the QRAMP initiative emphasizes its commitment to maintaining Bitcoin's core values by avoiding any form of confiscation or control. Instead, it seeks to align incentives among users, enhance security measures, and provide a clear, voluntary pathway towards upgrading the network's defenses against quantum computing threats. This careful consideration of both technological and community aspects underscores the proposal's holistic approach to navigating the challenges of quantum transition.</summary>
