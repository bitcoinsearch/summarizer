    <summary>The QRAMP proposal, as addressed to the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, presents a structured approach to ensure the cryptocurrency network remains secure in the face of quantum computing advancements. This initiative is designed to safeguard Bitcoinâ€™s foundational principles while responsibly managing the transition towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 

QRAMP unfolds in three deliberate phases to minimize disruption and maximize preparedness among users. The first phase introduces the option for wallets to integrate PQC keys within Taproot outputs, advocating for voluntary early adoption without imposing it on the entire network. This phase is pivotal for setting the groundwork for a smoother transition by encouraging proactive measures amongst users at their discretion.

The second phase of QRAMP proposes the initiation of a soft fork aimed at deactivating scripts vulnerable to quantum attacks. A significant aspect of this phase is the provision of a prolonged grace period, approximately four years, to facilitate widespread migration. This extended timeline is critical for avoiding abrupt adjustments, ensuring that users have sufficient time to adapt to the new security protocols without experiencing undue pressure or haste.

In its final phase, QRAMP plans to methodically deactivate vulnerable outputs, prioritizing those based on age or inactivity. This phased deactivation strategy is designed to prevent a precipitous cutoff, allowing users gradually to adjust. Additionally, the proposal includes mechanisms for exceptions through proof-of-possession and contemplates delaying restrictions on timelocked outputs to mitigate potential adverse impacts on future transactions.

Central to the QRAMP proposal is the commitment to avoid exerting control or initiating confiscation but rather to align incentives among network participants. By maintaining security and providing a clear, non-coercive pathway for upgrades, QRAMP aims to navigate the quantum transition effectively, preserving the integrity and functional continuity of Bitcoin.</summary>
