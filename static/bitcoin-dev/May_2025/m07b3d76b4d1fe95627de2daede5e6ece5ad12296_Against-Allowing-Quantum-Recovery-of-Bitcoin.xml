    <summary>The QRAMP proposal, recently introduced to the Bitcoin Development community, outlines a comprehensive strategy to navigate the quantum transition while upholding the fundamental tenets of Bitcoin. This initiative is structured around three pivotal phases designed to facilitate a smooth evolution towards quantum resistance without imposing undue pressure on users or compromising the network's integrity.

In the first phase, the proposal allows for an optional integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys within Taproot outputs. This approach encourages early adoption by providing flexibility and choice to wallet developers and users, thereby fostering a gradual transition without enforcement. The second phase involves the announcement of a soft fork aimed at disabling scripts that are susceptible to quantum attacks. To counterbalance potential disruptions, this phase incorporates a generous grace period of approximately four years. This extended timeline is intended to provide all network participants with ample opportunity to migrate their assets securely, ensuring that the transition is as seamless as possible.

The final phase introduces a methodical deactivation of vulnerable outputs, which is determined either by the age of the output or its inactivity. This measured approach seeks to minimize abrupt changes and allow users sufficient time to adapt to the new security standards. Additionally, the proposal includes provisions for exceptions through proof-of-possession mechanisms and suggests postponing restrictions on time-locked outputs. Such measures aim to protect future transactions from unintended consequences, thereby safeguarding the interests of all Bitcoin users.

Central to the QRAMP initiative is the commitment to security, incentive alignment, and a transparent upgrade pathway that respects user autonomy. By eschewing coercive tactics and focusing on a phased implementation, the proposal strives to maintain Bitcoin's core principles amidst the evolving landscape of quantum computing.</summary>
