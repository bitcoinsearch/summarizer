    <summary>The QRAMP proposal is designed to ensure a smooth transition for Bitcoin into the quantum-resistant era, focusing on maintaining the integrity and core principles of Bitcoin while enhancing its security against potential quantum computing threats. The strategy includes a phased approach that respects user choice and minimizes disruption. 

In the first phase, the proposal suggests allowing wallets to optionally include Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) keys in Taproot outputs. This phase encourages early adopters and innovators to start integrating quantum-resistant measures without imposing changes on the entire network. By not mandating immediate adoption, QRAMP ensures that the community can move forward at a comfortable pace, fostering innovation within a secure framework.

The second phase involves announcing a soft fork that would disable scripts vulnerable to quantum attacks, accompanied by a long grace period of approximately four years. This extended timeframe is critical for giving users ample opportunity to migrate their assets without experiencing undue stress or rush. It reflects a thoughtful approach to change management within the Bitcoin ecosystem, ensuring that stakeholders have sufficient notice and preparation time to adjust to new security standards.

Finally, the third phase outlines a gradual deactivation process for vulnerable outputs, which will be based on criteria such as age and inactivity. This method avoids sudden disruptions by phasing out at-risk components in a way that is both manageable for users and maintains the network's integrity. Additionally, the plan includes provisions for exceptions through proof-of-possession and delays in restrictions on timelocked outputs, thereby safeguarding the interests of future spenders and further demonstrating the proposal's consideration for all network participants.

QRAMP's emphasis is not on control or confiscation but on aligning incentives, preserving security, and providing a clear, voluntary path for upgrading the network's defenses against quantum threats. This approach underscores a commitment to consensus and inclusivity, ensuring that Bitcoin remains secure and true to its foundational principles in the face of evolving technological landscapes.</summary>
