    <summary>Agustin Cruz highlighted a crucial distinction in the discussion regarding blockchain splits, particularly focusing on the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) situation compared to a proposed Bitcoin (BTC) approach. He pointed out that during the ETH/ETC split, all participants maintained their token quantities across both chains, with the exception being the individual involved in the DAO hack. This contrasts significantly with a suggested strategy for BTC, especially concerning a quantum migration. In this BTC proposal, some holders would face the possibility of losing access to their coins, essentially experiencing confiscation. This observation underscores a fundamental difference in how these two scenarios manage the balance and rights of token holders, emphasizing the potential consequences for BTC users under the discussed approach.</summary>
