    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The communication highlights a significant distinction between the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) division and a proposed change in Bitcoin's protocol concerning a post-quantum (PQ) migration. The ETH/ETC split is noted for not resulting in any token confiscation from holders, except for the party involved in the DAO hack, with all participants retaining an equal number of tokens across both chains. Conversely, the proposed approach for Bitcoin introduces a scenario where some holders might lose access to their coins during the transition to a post-quantum secure system, marking a departure from the precedent set by the Ethereum split. This comparison underscores the unique challenges and considerations faced by the Bitcoin community in securing the network against quantum computing threats while also seeking to maintain equitable treatment of its users.</summary>
