    <summary>The recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List highlights a significant distinction between the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) split compared to the proposed changes for Bitcoin in relation to the post-quantum (PQ) migration strategy. Unlike the ETH/ETC scenario where the only party affected was the DAO hacker, with all other participants retaining their holdings across both chains, the proposed Bitcoin migration introduces a more controversial approach. Specifically, it involves a mechanism whereby some Bitcoin holders would lose access to their coins as part of the migration process. This aspect of the proposal marks a departure from previous blockchain adjustments, introducing a unique set of challenges and ethical considerations for the community and developers involved in planning and executing blockchain migrations.</summary>
