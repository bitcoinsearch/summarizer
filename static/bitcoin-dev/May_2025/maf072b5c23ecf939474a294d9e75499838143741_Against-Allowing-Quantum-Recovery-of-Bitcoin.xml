    <summary>Agustin Cruz highlights a critical difference between the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) split compared to a proposed change for Bitcoin (BTC). In the case of ETH/ETC, the division did not result in the confiscation of assets from anyone except the party involved in the DAO hack. Each holder retained an identical number of tokens on both chains following the split. However, the proposition for BTC introduces a significantly different approach where some holders might lose access to their coins during the Post-Quantum (PQ) migration due to a method that involves confiscation. This distinction is crucial for understanding the implications of proposed changes within blockchain technologies and their impact on asset ownership and security.</summary>
