    <summary>The email highlights skepticism towards the use of "black box" systems for generating mnemonic passphrases, emphasizing a preference for transparent and standardized methods. It references the BIP39 standard, which was established in 2013 and is widely accepted across different wallets for creating mnemonic phrases. This standard allows users to generate their own mnemonics in a way that does not require trust in any external system. The process involves using any source of entropy, applying a SHA256 hash to obtain a 256-bit string, converting this string into binary, and then performing another SHA256 hash. From this second hash, the first 8 bits are used as a checksum. This, combined with the rest of the binary data, is used to solve for the mnemonic words. The email includes a link to the GitHub repository where the BIP39 standard is documented, providing a resource for further reading on the topic ([BIP39 Standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawikiGenerating_the_mnemonic)). This approach to generating mnemonic phrases underscores the importance of transparency and user autonomy in the security practices of digital wallets.</summary>
