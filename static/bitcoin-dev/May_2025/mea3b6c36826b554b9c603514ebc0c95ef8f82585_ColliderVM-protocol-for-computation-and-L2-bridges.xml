    <summary>The ColliderVM represents a novel approach in the realm of blockchain protocols, offering an alternative to BitVM while operating under similar trust assumptions. Distinctively, ColliderVM eliminates the necessity for fraud proofs by removing the need for a fraud-proof time window. This advancement could potentially streamline certain processes within blockchain operations, although it is acknowledged that further development is required to fully realize its practical applications. The team behind ColliderVM is actively working on addressing these challenges and anticipates releasing more refined versions of the protocol.

Further insights into ColliderVM can be found through various resources provided by the team. A detailed paper discussing the technical aspects and potential implications of ColliderVM is available at [this link](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/591). It's important to note that the current version of the paper contains an inaccurate estimate regarding the BLAKE3 script size, a discrepancy intended to be corrected in an upcoming revision. For those preferring a more visual explanation, a video presentation has been prepared, elucidating the protocol's mechanics and its significance within the context of Bitcoin's evolving landscape, accessible here: [ColliderVM Protocol Video](https://starkware.co/blog/avihu-levy-bitcoin-horizons-from-op_cat-to-covenants-hong-kong/). Additionally, an extensive discussion and analysis of the ColliderVM protocol, particularly focusing on its application in computation and layer-2 bridges, is available at [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/collidervm-protocol-for-computation-and-l2-bridges/1662), providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its operational framework and potential impact on blockchain technology.

This information comes as part of updates shared with subscribers of the Google Groups "Bitcoin Development Mailing List," indicating the ongoing efforts and collaborative spirit within the community to explore and enhance blockchain technologies.</summary>
