    <summary>In a recent discussion, the implications of not migrating coins to post-quantum (PQ) address schemes were scrutinized. The conversation highlighted that individuals who fail to update their coins might be inclined to support any blockchain that retains their assets in their current state. Conversely, those who proactively shift to PQ address schemes may prefer blockchains that immobilize pre-quantum coins, thereby safeguarding against potential quantum attacks. This situation draws parallels to the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic split, underscoring that despite significant disruptions, Ethereum managed to maintain its dominance even after implementing controversial measures to counteract a major theft.

The dialogue further explored the notion that enforcing a separation between quantum-vulnerable and quantum-safe coins could serve as a practical experiment to determine their relative market values. Such a split would essentially provide a clear choice for investors between securing their assets against quantum threats or opting for a system that remains susceptible. The underlying belief is that the market should freely decide the fate of these divergent coin types through natural selection. This approach champions the free market's ability to effectively adjudicate between competing technologies, emphasizing that the ultimate decision lies with the individual users and their willingness to either embrace or resist transitioning to quantum-secure platforms.</summary>
