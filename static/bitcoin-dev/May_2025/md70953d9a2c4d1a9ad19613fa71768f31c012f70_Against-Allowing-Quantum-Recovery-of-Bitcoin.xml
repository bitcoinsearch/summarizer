    <title>Against Allowing Quantum Recovery of Bitcoin</title>

    <summary>The discussion revolves around the potential consequences and strategic considerations regarding the migration of cryptocurrency coins to post-quantum (PQ) address schemes in response to the threat posed by quantum computing. The conversation highlights a scenario where individuals who fail to migrate their coins to PQ address schemes might be inclined to support any blockchain that continues to recognize their non-migrated, pre-quantum coins. Conversely, there is an expectation that those who do migrate will lean towards supporting a chain that opts to freeze the unmigrated, quantum-vulnerable coins to safeguard against quantum attacks.

Drawing parallels with the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) split, the email underscores the resilience of the dominant chain (ETH) despite a controversial rollback, suggesting that the potential confusion and loss of face associated with freezing quantum-vulnerable coins could be considered a lesser evil compared to the risks of leaving the network open to quantum-enabled exploits. This perspective champions the idea of a free market solution where the value of quantum-safe versus quantum-vulnerable coins would be determined through their performance on separate chains, thereby allowing market forces to dictate the preferable option. 

Ultimately, the message asserts the importance of providing choices to the participants of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, enabling them to decide whether they wish to be part of a system vulnerable to quantum attacks or one that is safeguarded against such threats. The narrative conveys a respect for individual agency within the market dynamics, emphasizing that while the sender has a clear preference, the decision lies with each participant in the network.</summary>
