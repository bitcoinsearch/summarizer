    <summary>The discussion initiated by Dustin Ray touches on the complex dynamics that might arise with the introduction of post-quantum (PQ) cryptographic address schemes in the context of cryptocurrency, specifically referencing a potential split similar to the Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) situation. Dustin points out the dilemma faced by holders of pre-quantum coins regarding migrating their assets to PQ address schemes. He highlights that those who choose not to migrate may be inclined to support a blockchain version where their coins remain valid, whereas individuals who do migrate would naturally prefer a version of the blockchain where unmigrated, quantum-vulnerable coins are frozen, thus enhancing security against quantum computing threats.

Dustin argues that despite the potential for confusion and the challenge of making such a significant transition, the integrity and security of the network should take precedence over concerns about public perception or the inconvenience caused by a split. He believes that allowing the market to decide through a split, thereby offering a choice between a quantum-safe and a quantum-vulnerable chain, embodies the principles of a free market. This approach permits users to make informed decisions based on their preferences for security against quantum attacks versus the continuity of the existing system without migration.

This conversation underscores the broader debate within the cryptocurrency community regarding how best to prepare for the advent of quantum computing. It reflects the tension between maintaining the status quo for the sake of stability and user convenience versus proactively adopting more secure technologies to safeguard the network against future threats. Ultimately, Dustin's stance is that providing options and letting market dynamics dictate the outcome is the most effective way to navigate these challenges, even though he personally favors the adoption of quantum-safe measures.</summary>
