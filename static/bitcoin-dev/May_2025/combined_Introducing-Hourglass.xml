    <summary>The discussions on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List have recently focused on the implications of quantum computing (QC) on early Pay-to-PubKey (P2PK) coins within the Bitcoin network. A key concern is the potential for future exploitation of these coins by entities capable of quantum computing, which could feasibly crack cryptographic keys at an alarming rate. This issue has been quantified with an estimation that 45,700 P2PK outputs could be at risk, outlining a scenario where QC advancements enable the cracking of one key per block, effectively spanning nearly a year's worth of UTXO generation based on current metrics.

Several strategies and outcomes regarding the handling of this issue were explored, including the idea that allowing these vulnerable coins to be "naturally recycled" without altering their unlocking scripts is superior both technically and morally. The approach advocates for cryptographic romanticism over more authoritarian measures such as freezing or burning the affected coins. However, the emergence of multiple entities with QC capabilities could lead to bidding wars for transaction inclusion or collusion to suppress fees, affecting the mining ecosystem and the overall security of the Bitcoin network.

On a strategic level, miners with QC capabilities might opt for a selective inclusion of P2PK transactions in their blocks, aiming to optimize long-term gains. This tactic, however, introduces concerns regarding Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and the competitiveness among miners, especially those without QC partnerships. The speculative nature of these scenarios emphasizes the complexity of securing early P2PK coins without undermining the foundational principles of Bitcoin.

In response to these challenges, a proposal has been put forward to prevent the mass liquidation of P2PK funds. This solution is thoroughly documented in a specification available on GitHub, encouraging community feedback and participation in refining the approach. The initiative highlights the importance of addressing the security vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing developments while maintaining the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin. Interested parties can access the full details of the proposed solution through the provided [GitHub link](https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/blob/hourglass/bip-hourglass.mediawiki), underscoring its relevance to subscribers of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List and the wider community concerned with the technical evolution and security of Bitcoin.</summary>
