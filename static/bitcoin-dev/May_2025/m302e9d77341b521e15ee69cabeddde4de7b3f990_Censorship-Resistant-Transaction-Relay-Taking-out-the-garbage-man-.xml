    <summary>In an innovative approach to address the need for a censorship-resistant key-based discovery mechanism, PKDNS has been introduced as a solution that leverages the Mainline DHT, recognized as the largest and oldest peer-to-peer network globally. This technology enables the creation of public-key domains that are solely under the control of the keyholder, eschewing the necessity for blockchain technology. PKDNS facilitates a range of functionalities including the dynamic provisioning or updating of endpoints, key association or disassociation, and the establishment of revocable account-based sessions.

The platform's utility in enhancing privacy and security online is further elaborated through detailed explanations available via two Medium articles. These articles aim to clarify common misconceptions and counterarguments regarding public-key domains and the Mainline DHT's role in circumventing censorship. The first article, ["Public-Key Domains: Censorship Resistance Explained"](https://medium.com/pubky/public-key-domains-censorship-resistance-explained-33d0333e6123), delves into the specifics of how public-key domains function and their significance in promoting a censorship-resistant digital environment. The second piece, ["Mainline DHT: Censorship Explained"](https://medium.com/pubky/mainline-dht-censorship-explained-b62763db39cb), provides insight into the underlying technology—Mainline DHT—and its pivotal role in safeguarding against censorship.

This initiative reflects a broader effort to safeguard digital communication and enhance privacy through technological innovation. By offering a decentralized alternative for secure identity verification and communication, PKDNS represents a significant step forward in the ongoing battle against digital censorship and surveillance.</summary>
