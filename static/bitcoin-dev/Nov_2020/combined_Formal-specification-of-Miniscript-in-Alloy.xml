    <summary>Dmitry Petukhov has recently developed a formal specification of Miniscript using the Alloy analyzer's specification language. This specification serves multiple purposes, including aiding in the implementation of Miniscript libraries, generating test cases for implementation, and ensuring the accuracy of the implementation against the spec. Furthermore, the spec can also be used to extend or modify Miniscript and explore its various properties.The Alloy spec created by Petukhov is noteworthy as it represents the first formal specification for Miniscript. Notably, the node definitions within the spec are highly readable, facilitating ease of use and comprehension. While other frameworks, such as the K framework, could have been used for this task, they lacked reference documentation at the time.However, users should bear in mind that the spec may contain some errors or inconsistencies. As a result, Dmitry encourages users to submit any issues they encounter on Github or communicate them through other means. By doing so, the spec can be refined and improved over time.In addition to sharing the spec on Github, Dmitry Petukhov also responded to Clark's query about whether there were any other spec definitions in alternate formal grammars. It appears that, at present, the Alloy spec is the only one available, but Dmitry welcomes any contributions or suggestions from individuals interested in Miniscript.Overall, the formal specification of Miniscript created by Dmitry Petukhov offers a valuable resource for developers and researchers working with Miniscript. With its potential applications in library implementation, test case generation, implementation verification, and exploration of Miniscript properties, this spec provides an important foundation for further progress in the field.</summary>
