    <summary>The email from Antoine to Victor addresses the prevalent misuse of the term "vaults" within the Bitcoin community. Antoine points out that the label "vaults" has been indiscriminately applied to various constructs, such as vanilla multisig wallets, CTV transaction chains, and decaying multisig wallets, despite these constructs having distinct properties and functionalities. This broad application of the term has led to confusion, as "vaults" originally had a specific meaning in the context of Bitcoin, which is detailed on a webpage hosted by [Bitcoin Ops](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/).

Antoine then introduces "Liana," a construct that Victor's proposal resembles but with notable differences. Liana, available at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana/), opts for relative timelocks (CSV) over absolute timelocks (CLTV). The choice for CSV over CLTV is made to avoid the complications associated with the expiration dates imposed by CLTV, which can confuse users, especially those with less technical expertise. Additionally, Liana differentiates itself by integrating a pruned Bitcoin Core node and leveraging its watchonly wallet functionality to monitor user coins. For scenarios where a remote node is necessary, Liana diverges from Bitcoin Core's RPC interface, which is deemed unsuitable, and alternatively supports configuration with an Electrum server. This detailed explanation underlines the necessity for clear and accurate terminology within the Bitcoin development community to prevent misunderstandings and highlights the thoughtful design considerations behind Liana that aim to enhance user experience and accessibility.</summary>
