    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, Antoine Poinsot raised a question concerning the implementation of a normative unwrapping approach as suggested by Greg. The primary concern was whether this method could potentially disrupt timelocked transactions, especially considering the mapping of timestamp values to real time across the year 2106 boundary. This inquiry highlights the complexities involved in adjusting Bitcoin's transaction mechanisms, particularly in relation to ensuring the integrity and functionality of transactions that are bound by specific time conditions. The dialogue underlines the need for meticulous consideration of changes to Bitcoin's core functionalities to prevent unintended consequences on its operational reliability, especially for transactions that span significant future dates.</summary>
