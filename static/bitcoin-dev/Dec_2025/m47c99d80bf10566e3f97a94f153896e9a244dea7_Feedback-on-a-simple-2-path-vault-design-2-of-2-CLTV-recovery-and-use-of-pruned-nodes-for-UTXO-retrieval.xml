    <summary>Victor's educational journey into the intricacies of Bitcoin wallet functionalities and Miniscript can be methodically approached through a series of focused steps, each building upon the knowledge acquired in the preceding one. Initially, Victor is encouraged to familiarize himself with the Bitcoin Core wallet API, exploiting its multi-wallet feature to simulate various signer scenarios alongside a funding wallet. This foundational exercise involves generating keys, registering descriptors for each, and engaging in the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) signing process to facilitate transactions between the simulated wallets. To enhance this experience, utilizing Signet for realistic transaction conditions or regtest for rapid iteration is suggested.

Further depth in understanding can be achieved by incorporating the BDK library into Victor's workflow. The BDK library serves as an introduction to descriptor scanning across different "chain sources" and PSBT processing without the need to delve into the granular details immediately. This stage not only broadens Victor's practical skills but also sets the stage for a deeper exploration into the implementation aspects of the BDK library itself, and for those with a keen interest, the Rust-Miniscript library. This exploration is pivotal for uncovering the nuances and potential pitfalls associated with implementing such constructions, especially the critical and sometimes surprising aspects of Bitcoin Script and its abstraction via Miniscript.

The exploration extends beyond software to the hardware interface, notably how hardware signing devices integrate with complex wallet spending policies. Through studying Salvatore Ingala's "wallet policies" and experimenting with hardware signers like Ledger and Coldcard, Victor can gain insights into the communication processes with these devices, guided by resources such as the Wizardsardine team's "async-hwi".

Lastly, the journey culminates in the realization that creating robust software capable of adapting to diverse usage scenarios, recovery configurations, and interfaces requires significant time investment. For Victor, engaging with mature Miniscript-utilizing projects like Liana or Nunchuk offers invaluable lessons in developing software that balances functionality with user experience. Participation in discussion groups related to these projects and Miniscript on platforms like Libera.chat or Bitcoin Stack Exchange is recommended for diving deeper into the technical aspects of Miniscript and related technologies.</summary>
