    <summary>In an ongoing discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a recent presentation at the 6th PQC Standardization Conference highlighted the consideration of smaller SPHINCS+ parameters by NIST. Specifically, the conversation focuses on the parameters detailed in slide 3 of the presentation, indicating active discussions around their standardization. Despite the enthusiasm and advocacy for a swifter standardization process reflected in forum posts linked within the presentation, there seems to be an understanding that the formal adoption of these additional parameter sets will not occur in the immediate future. For those interested in the specifics of the SPHINCS+ parameters and the context of their standardization, the presentation can be accessed through this [link](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/presentations/2025/sphincs-smaller-parameter-sets/sphincs-dang_2.2.pdf). This development is significant for those involved in Bitcoin development and cryptography, underscoring the ongoing evolution of post-quantum cryptographic standards and their implications for digital currencies and security protocols.</summary>
