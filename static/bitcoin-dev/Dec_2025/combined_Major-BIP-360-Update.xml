    <summary>In a collaborative effort led by Ethan Heilman, Isabel Foxen Duke, and their team, there's been a significant revision of BIP 360 to enhance Bitcoin's resilience against potential quantum computing threats. This overhaul was initiated due to the need for clearer and more coherent proposals after community feedback highlighted that previous versions had undergone extensive technical changes. Unlike its predecessors, the revised BIP 360 shifts away from incorporating post-quantum signature schemes. It introduces an innovative output type known as "Pay-to-Tapscript-Hash (P2TSH)," specifically designed to omit the key path spend feature. This strategic move is aimed at protecting against vulnerabilities in Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) that could be exploited by quantum computing advances or other cryptanalytic breakthroughs. The decision to focus on preemptive measures rather than transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic methods at this stage underlines a commitment to proactively safeguarding Bitcoin’s infrastructure against emerging threats.
The updated proposal not only brings clarity but also strengthens its technical foundation by including test vectors in both Python and Rust languages. These enhancements are intended to foster wider engagement within the developer community, ensuring comprehensive vetting and feedback on the proposed changes. The team is actively inviting feedback and contributions through the BIP Repo ([GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1670)) and a dedicated website ([BIP360.org](http://bip360.org)), emphasizing the importance of a collective approach in fortifying Bitcoin against quantum computing risks.
Furthermore, the initiative acknowledges broader security concerns beyond just quantum threats, such as the potential for implementation bugs due to public key exposure. By integrating BIP 360 with other proposals like TXHASH, it becomes possible to devise quantum-safe scripts and multi-step commit-reveal vaults that do not solely rely on signatures. This approach not only addresses quantum-related vulnerabilities but also aims to mitigate broader security issues by fostering more robust mining for implementation flaws and enhancing capabilities through lightweight, proven technology. The aspiration to advance BIPs 360, 119, and 346 as part of a comprehensive "quantum-readiness" plan reflects a forward-looking strategy to protect Bitcoin with commitments and hashes until the cryptocurrency industry reaches a consensus on post-quantum signatures and develops a hardened, efficient, and reliable cryptographic library akin to libsecp256k1 for ECC. This venture highlights the ongoing challenges and considerations in preparing Bitcoin for future cryptographic landscapes, emphasizing the necessity for a methodical and inclusive development process.</summary>
