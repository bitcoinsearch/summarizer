    <summary>The discourse around enhancing Bitcoin's security in the face of quantum computing advances has led to a detailed examination of hash-based schemes, particularly focusing on their application as a post-quantum solution. A comprehensive technical report available at [https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2203.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2203.pdf) delves into these schemes, offering an exploration of parameter selections, security analyses, and implementation considerations. The supporting scripts for this analysis are hosted on GitHub, accessible via [https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SPHINCS-Parameters](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SPHINCS-Parameters). Hash-based signatures emerge as a robust choice due to their reliance on the well-established security of hash functions, such as SHA-256, which Bitcoin already utilizes. This method's simplicity, alongside its proven resilience through extensive cryptanalysis during the NIST post-quantum standardization process, underscores its potential viability.
However, one notable challenge with hash-based signatures, such as SPHINCS+, is their large size, with standard signatures approaching 8KB. Nonetheless, there are optimizations that can significantly reduce this size. By adjusting the number of allowable signatures and applying certain optimizations, it’s possible to decrease signature sizes dramatically, making them more feasible for practical use in Bitcoin transactions. For instance, setting a bound of 2^40 signatures can yield sizes around 4036 bytes, with further reductions achievable through lower bounds. These sizes are competitive, especially when considering the compactness of public keys within hash-based schemes, which stand at approximately 256 bits.
The conversation extends into operational considerations, weighing the merits of stateless versus stateful schemes in the context of key management and performance. Stateless schemes, where the secret key does not require updating with each signature, present a simpler model. However, stateful schemes could potentially offer performance benefits despite introducing complexity in key management. The integration of hash-based schemes within Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets highlights challenges, especially concerning public child key derivation, though hardened derivation remains feasible.
Further discussion points include the exploration of multi-signature, distributed, and threshold signatures within a post-quantum framework. The effectiveness and practicality of these approaches vary, with some requiring a trusted dealer, which could limit applicability. The blog invites community feedback on several fronts, including the performance requirements across different hardware platforms, the standardization of multiple schemes catering to varied signature limits, and the value of integrating stateful schemes alongside stateless ones.
This analysis not only sheds light on the technical intricacies and considerations of employing hash-based, post-quantum cryptographic solutions within Bitcoin but also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and feedback in navigating these complex decisions. The goal is to ensure Bitcoin's resilience against quantum computing threats while maintaining operational efficiency and user security.</summary>
