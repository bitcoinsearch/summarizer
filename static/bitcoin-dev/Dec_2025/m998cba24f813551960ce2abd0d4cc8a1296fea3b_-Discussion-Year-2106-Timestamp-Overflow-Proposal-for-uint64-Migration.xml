    <summary>In discussing the mechanics of blockchain technology, it's crucial to understand the role of timestamps and how they influence the chain's continuity. Each new block added to a blockchain must have a timestamp that is strictly greater than the Median Time Past (MTP) of the previous blocks. This requirement ensures the chronological integrity of the blockchain, preventing any form of temporal tampering that could compromise the sequence of transactions.

However, this design also introduces a potential endpoint for the blockchain. As timestamps cannot be arbitrary and must reflect a progression in time, there's an upper limit to how many blocks can be sequentially added. If every new block must have a timestamp greater than the last, eventually, the system will reach a point where no further blocks can be appended due to the maximum allowable timestamp being reached. This scenario presents a theoretical end to the blockchain's growth, where its temporal bound becomes a limiting factor.

This information, pertinent to developers and participants in the Bitcoin ecosystem, highlights a fundamental aspect of blockchain's design limitations. It underscores the balance between maintaining accurate, tamper-resistant records and the inherent constraints placed by the system's reliance on real-world timekeeping.
