    <title>Secondary mailing list for moderated emails</title>
    <updated>2025-12-21T03:08:25.112418+00:00</updated>
    <link href="https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/CALiT-ZqQGkEJXxVPSMmXYC1qTafAFShx=2QrMS5mkm-y6M=+nQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#u#m44d21f6e9e4aaf030e93b748c33071c1bf773cb6" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>In an effort to streamline communication and ensure that moderated emails reach their intended audience, a new procedure has been implemented for the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. A secondary mailing list, similar to the one previously found at [https://lists.ozlabs.org/listinfo/bitcoin-dev-moderation](https://lists.ozlabs.org/listinfo/bitcoin-dev-moderation), has been established to handle moderated messages. The newly created email address for this purpose is bitcoin-dev-moderation@googlegroups.com.

For those who find their emails subjected to moderation and subsequently not visible on the primary Bitcoin Development Mailing List hosted at [https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/), the recommended course of action is to resend the email. Including the aforementioned moderation list email address in either the Cc or Bcc fields of the resend email ensures the message is appropriately directed and considered for inclusion or discussion within the community's communications. This adjustment aims to facilitate smoother operations and more efficient handling of moderated content, ensuring valuable contributions do not go unnoticed.</summary>
