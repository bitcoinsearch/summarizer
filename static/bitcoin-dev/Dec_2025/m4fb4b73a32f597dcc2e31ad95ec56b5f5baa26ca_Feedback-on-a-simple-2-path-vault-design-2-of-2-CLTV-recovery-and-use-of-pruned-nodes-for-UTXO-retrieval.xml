    <summary>Victor is focusing on simplifying his work by initially targeting a single spending path, specifically a clean 2-of-2 multisig scenario involving two Ledgers. His objective is to ensure stability across various stages, including descriptor creation, UTXO handling, PSBT flow, hardware signing, and finally, broadcasting before he considers adding a recovery path with a timelock. His application serves an educational purpose within a Ruby on Rails environment, aiming to deepen his understanding of Bitcoin through practical experimentation rather than functioning as a secondary Liana.

The application Victor is developing encompasses several modules, each designed to explore different facets of Bitcoin technology and its applications. These include a vault module for experimenting with descriptors, Miniscript/Taproot constructions, PSBTs, and hardware signing; a BRC-20 and on-chain analytics module aimed at blockchain data extraction and analysis; and a donation module using sats connected to his BTCPay Server. Additionally, the app features various dashboards for visualizing Bitcoin data, providing a comprehensive toolkit for studying and interacting with the cryptocurrency in multiple ways.

Unlike typical development practices that might use regtest for safety and efficiency, Victor's experiments are conducted directly on Bitcoin's mainnet with real BTC. This approach ensures that he confronts real-world constraints head-on, compelling him to design his solutions with great care. However, acknowledging the benefits of regtest for rapid iteration and safe edge-case testing, Victor plans to integrate this into his workflow, following the advice received.

Guidance from the community has been instrumental in shaping Victor's approach, offering him a clear roadmap for future development. Recommendations have included leveraging Bitcoin Core's wallet API, BDK (Bitcoin Development Kit), Miniscript, and adhering to hardware-wallet policies, all of which are intended to streamline his progress and refine his application's functionality.</summary>
