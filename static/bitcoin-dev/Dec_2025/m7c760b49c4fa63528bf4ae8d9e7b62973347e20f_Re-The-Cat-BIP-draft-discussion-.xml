    <summary>The proposal presented by Matteo Pellegrini introduces a novel mechanism aimed at addressing the issue of UTXO set bloat in Bitcoin through a consensus-enforced, periodic process. This process targets UTXOs below the network's dust threshold, rendering them permanently unspendable following each halving event. This strategy aims to prune these UTXOs from the set, thereby reducing storage requirements for nodes and discouraging practices that lead to their proliferation.

At the core of the motivation for this proposal is the significant growth observed in the Bitcoin UTXO set, attributed to factors such as inscription protocols, spam attacks, and accumulation of dust. Previous methods, notably "The Cat" proposal, sought to address this through the creation of lists identifying specific UTXOs to be rendered unspendable. However, this approach was found to have several limitations, including reliance on external indexers, potential for protocol discrimination, and vulnerability to politicization. The Lynx proposal circumvents these issues by employing a threshold-based rule rather than a curated list, eliminating the need for external dependencies and subjective judgments regarding UTXO validity.

The implementation specifics of the Lynx proposal are straightforward yet effective. It establishes a fixed dust threshold of 999 satoshis and utilizes the Bitcoin halving events as temporal markers for enforcing UTXO spendability rules. UTXOs existing at a snapshot block (taken at each halving) that are valued below this threshold and remain unspent until the next halving will become unspendable. This measure not only simplifies enforcement but also promises ongoing maintenance of the UTXO set without necessitating continuous governance decisions.

Furthermore, the proposal is designed with backward compatibility in mind, functioning as a soft fork. Non-upgraded nodes will continue recognizing all historical transactions as valid, gradually aligning with the upgraded network over time. Additionally, the proposal outlines considerations for wallets and services to assist users in managing sub-threshold UTXOs, including warning mechanisms and consolidation tools to be utilized during the grace period preceding enforcement.

Security aspects of the proposal assure that no value confiscation occurs; affected UTXOs simply transition to a state akin to that of lost keys or provably unspendable outputs. Special attention is given to potential impacts on the Lightning Network, with preliminary analysis suggesting minimal disruption due to existing conservative dust limits within LN operations. Nonetheless, further examination by implementers is deemed necessary.

In conclusion, the Lynx proposal offers a sustainable and neutral approach to mitigating UTXO set bloat, emphasizing predictability, simplicity, and fairness in its execution. By targeting the economic underpinnings rather than specific use cases, it seeks to establish a permanent norm against the accumulation of uneconomical UTXOs, thus ensuring continued efficiency and scalability of the Bitcoin network.
