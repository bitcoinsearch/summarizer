    <title>[BIP Proposal] Peer Feature Negotiation</title>

    <summary>The discussion opens with the consideration of new peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging protocols that could enhance the functionality and efficiency of blockchain networks. Specifically, it highlights the potential benefits of implementing template sharing, updating the bip324-one-byte-message-types, and facilitating the sharing of recent stale blocks. These innovations aim to improve network communication and data sharing among nodes, which could lead to significant improvements in how blockchain networks operate and manage information.

Further exploration into the negotiation of new features within the blockchain context led to a revisit of previous discussions from 2020, where the concept of a "FEATURE" message was proposed. This idea remains favorable as a means to streamline the introduction and negotiation of new capabilities within the network. Inspired by Ava's encouragement for more proactive contributions to Blockchain Improvement Proposals (BIPs), a new BIP has been drafted and is available for review at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/ajtowns/bips/blob/202512-p2p-feature/bip-peer-feature-negotiation.md). Accompanying this proposal is sample code, provided to illustrate the proposed mechanisms in practice, accessible [here](https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commit/80301f0040fe6048a85b89d0fdf0ffcca836a1d0).

While acknowledging that the proposed BIP might currently appear over-engineered for its intended purposes, it's argued that a more comprehensive approach is preferable to ensure thoroughness and prevent issues encountered during previous deployments, such as those experienced with SENDADDRV2. The BIP includes detailed background information, aiming to address and mitigate potential challenges before they arise.

An important aspect covered in the proposal is the strategy for sharing stale block (or header) information more proactively across the network. This approach is believed to provide deeper insights into orphan rates and the dynamics between extending the chain versus potential reorganizations. Furthermore, it posits an improvement in syncing efficiency following reorgs, as nodes would already possess the necessary parent data of the new tip, streamlining the process of aligning with the current state of the blockchain.

This initiative reflects a broader ambition within the blockchain development community to continuously seek out and implement solutions that enhance the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of P2P networks, ensuring their ongoing evolution and optimization in response to emerging challenges and opportunities.</summary>
