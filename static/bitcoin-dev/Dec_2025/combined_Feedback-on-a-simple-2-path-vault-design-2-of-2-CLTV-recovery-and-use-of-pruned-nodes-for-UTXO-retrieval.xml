    <summary>Victor is developing a non-custodial vault system with a focus on a 2-of-2 multisig construction and a CSV-based recovery path, aiming for a solution that enhances the security and functionality of Bitcoin transactions without introducing custodial risks. His system employs an immediate spending path requiring both keys for transaction authorization and a delayed recovery path facilitated by a time-delay mechanism. Victor's inquiries delve into the feasibility of integrating a pruned Bitcoin Core node to optimize storage while managing UTXOs, constructing PSBTs, and broadcasting transactions. He seeks feedback on the overall safety of his script design and the potential for implementing Taproot-based solutions, aiming to refine the system to serve as a robust inheritance or emergency fund mechanism.
Antoine addresses the confusion surrounding the term "vaults" in the Bitcoin community, pointing out the need for precise language to avoid misunderstandings. The discussion highlights "Liana," a construct similar to Victor's project but opting for relative timelocks (CSV) over absolute ones (CLTV) to circumvent user confusion related to expiration dates. Liana integrates a pruned Bitcoin Core node with watchonly wallet functionality and supports configuration with an Electrum server for scenarios requiring remote nodes. This comparison underlines the importance of clear terminology and thoughtful design in Bitcoin development to enhance user experience.
Victor recognizes the terminology issue and aligns his project more accurately with existing constructs like Liana, focusing on educational goals and the practical application of multisig recovery systems. He opts for a CSV-based approach over CLTV due to its flexibility and aims to create a user-friendly system. Despite not initially supporting pruned nodes, Victor is open to adopting strategies that improve efficiency and accessibility. His project encompasses a broader vision, including features like inheritance flows and analytics, highlighting his commitment to contribute to the Bitcoin development community meaningfully.
Victor's approach to learning about Bitcoin wallet functionalities involves engaging with the Bitcoin Core wallet API, exploring the BDK library for descriptor scanning and PSBT processing, and understanding hardware signer integration. This structured educational journey includes experimenting with hardware signing devices and delving into the complexities of Miniscript. Victor plans to focus initially on a stable 2-of-2 multisig flow using two Ledgers before incorporating a recovery path with a timelock. His work, distinct from Liana, serves as an educational and experimental environment within Ruby on Rails, allowing him to explore various aspects of Bitcoin technology in practice. Victor's decision to work directly on the mainnet reflects his commitment to understanding real-world constraints, supported by a recommendation to integrate regtest for safer iteration and testing.</summary>
