    <summary>Victor acknowledges the confusion surrounding the use of the term "vault" in the Bitcoin community, agreeing to adopt more precise language to describe his project. He clarifies that his work centers on a 2-of-2 multisig construction with a CSV-based recovery path, drawing inspiration from similar projects like Liana. His primary focus is educational, aiming to comprehend the entire process from descriptor and address generation to UTXO tracking and transaction building, alongside hardware signing and implementing a recovery flow. Victor's project does not seek to introduce groundbreaking innovations in the concept of "vaults" but rather to develop a practical multisig recovery system before considering more complex designs.

He also discusses his decision to utilize CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) over CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) due to the latter's introduction of an implicit expiration, which can be challenging to explain to those without a technical background. The flexibility afforded by CSV helps avoid making descriptors obsolete, aligning with his goal of creating a user-friendly system.

Regarding the technical aspects of his development environment, Victor mentions operating a full, non-pruned Bitcoin Core node to facilitate UTXO retrieval, acknowledging that he has yet to implement support for pruned nodes. However, he expresses interest in adopting strategies similar to Liana, which uses a pruned watch-only wallet with an Electrum fallback, indicating his openness to learning from existing solutions to improve his project.

Finally, Victor outlines his broader vision for the project, which includes expanding beyond its current scope to incorporate features such as inheritance flows, user-friendly recovery logic, and analytics once the foundational aspects are firmly established. He appreciates the guidance offered and expresses a desire for recommendations on avoiding common pitfalls and resources on robust recovery design, highlighting his commitment to contributing meaningfully to the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
