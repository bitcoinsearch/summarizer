    <summary>In a recent dialogue among developers, concerns were raised regarding the friction encountered in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) process. It was highlighted that the current bandwidth for managing BIPs is insufficient, as evidenced by Luke's admission of not being able to actively tend to the BIPs repository. This situation has led to a bottleneck, impeding the timely review and integration of new proposals as well as amendments to existing ones.

To address these challenges, there is a proposal on the table to expand the team of BIP editors. These new editors would inherit the same level of permissions and responsibilities currently held by Luke. This includes the ability to assign BIP numbers, merge pull requests for new BIPs, make corrections to existing BIPs, and manage other related tasks as outlined in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawikiuser-content-BIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow). The addition of more editors is anticipated to accelerate the processing of backlog PRs and enhance the efficiency of incorporating changes into BIPs.

For the integrity and consistency of the BIP numbering system, it is crucial that all editors align on the numbering scheme. The selection criteria for new BIP editors are stringent, emphasizing the importance of a track record in Bitcoin development participation, an objective approach to evaluating proposals, and a willingness to undertake the responsibilities of the role. Two individuals, Kanzure and RubenSomsen, have been identified as fitting candidates for the position of BIP editors, given their active involvement and contributions to Bitcoin development. Their inclusion as BIP editors is expected to significantly benefit the Bitcoin developer community by streamlining the BIP process.</summary>
