    <summary>The recent discussions have highlighted a noticeable friction within the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP) process, particularly due to Luke's admission of his inability to actively manage the BIPs repository. This situation underscores the necessity to appoint additional BIP editors who would inherit the same permissions and responsibilities as the current overseers – specifically, the ability to assign BIP numbers, merge pull requests for new proposals, address fixes to existing BIPs, among other tasks detailed in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawikiuser-content-BIP_Editor_Responsibilities__Workflow). The introduction of more editors is seen as a critical step towards alleviating the backlog of BIP submissions and enhancing the overall efficiency of the process.

For the BIP process to maintain its integrity and consistency, it is vital that any new editors are in agreement on the numbering scheme of the BIPs. The roles these editors will play are crucial, requiring individuals with a proven track record in following and contributing to Bitcoin development. Their ability to objectively evaluate proposals is equally important. In light of these requirements, Kanzure and RubenSomsen are proposed as suitable candidates for the role of BIP editors. Their involvement is expected to bring significant improvements to the management and progression of the BIPs repository, benefiting the Bitcoin development community at large.</summary>
