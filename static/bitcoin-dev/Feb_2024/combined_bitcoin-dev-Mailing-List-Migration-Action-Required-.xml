    <summary>The bitcoindev mailing list has successfully transitioned to Google Groups, marking the end of accepting subscriptions through the old system as of February 2024. To ensure continued participation and receipt of emails, it's crucial for members and interested parties to subscribe to the new platform without delay. The transition will include a brief pause before allowing new emails to ensure everyone has ample time to join. Subscription can be achieved in two ways: sending an email to a specified address and replying to an automated response—checking the spam folder if necessary—or by subscribing via the online interface at [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev) using any email associated with a Google account. Active involvement in the community discussions is encouraged by opting to receive all messages, which facilitates easy replies and interaction within threads. To avoid cluttering one's main inbox, setting up a filter for the specific mailing list address is advised.
Further enhancing accessibility, the mailing list archive is available online and backed externally, ensuring that both new and historical content remains accessible without requiring a Google account at [gnusha.org](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev). While Google's platform is utilized for distribution, the emphasis on not relying solely on Google underscores a commitment to maintaining public access to information. The initiative to create additional public archives of the mailing list is encouraged, with straightforward instructions provided for anyone interested in hosting. Details of such archives should be shared with the moderators once set up. A comprehensive archive of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, including detailed instructions for verification, is available at [diyhpl.us](https://diyhpl.us/~bryan/irc/bitcoin/bitcoin-dev/bitcoin-dev-ml-archive.2024-02-09-004.tar.gz), ensuring the preservation of the mailing list’s integrity and history.
Mailing lists serve as a broad communication medium with limited moderation, emphasizing the importance of considering the broader audience when posting, especially for new topics, to maintain a productive signal-to-noise ratio. The rules governing the list have remained unchanged, accessible for review to ensure compliance and understanding of community standards. Appreciation was expressed towards Joe Rayhawk for his assistance with the migration, highlighting the collaborative effort involved in the process. For additional support or inquiries, moderator contact information is provided, facilitating open communication and assistance for members of the mailing list community.</summary>
