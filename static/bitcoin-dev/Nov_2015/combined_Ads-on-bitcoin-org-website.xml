    <summary>A concern has been raised by Jonas Schnelli, via bitcoin-dev, regarding the future of Bitcoin.org. As Bitcoin.org is responsible for hosting the Bitcoin Core binaries mentioned in release announcements, it is deemed relevant to discuss this topic on bitcoin-dev. However, it has been suggested that inquiries about the operations of Bitcoin.org should be directed to bitcoin-discuss, while issues related to advertising should be addressed through the referenced PRs. Dave, one of the maintainers of Bitcoin.org, has provided several suggestions in response, including joining bitcoin-discuss to ask questions, opening a GitHub issue to discuss advertising on the site, and exploring the possibility of relocating the Bitcoin Core binaries if there is general dissatisfaction with the addition of advertisements. Links to both bitcoin-discuss and the GitHub issue have been provided.Recently, the author of a post on Bitcoin.org expressed concerns about the neutrality of the site. The author emphasizes the importance of maintaining an unbiased platform for information on bitcoin, its applications, and exchanges. Criticism is directed towards the merging of a pull request (PR) that would introduce Google Analytics to the site, as the author believes this action contradicts the principles of determining who holds control over bitcoin and violates the underlying philosophy of bitcoin. Furthermore, the author highlights another PR that, if merged, would enable ads on Bitcoin.org, arguing that such a move would undermine the site's commitment to neutrality. Questioning how changes are implemented on Bitcoin.org, the author seeks clarification on whether decisions are made based on consensus among contributors or if a select group determines which changes are incorporated and which are not. To address the issue of site operators or contributors requiring compensation for their work or infrastructure expenses, the author suggests tackling the root problem and raising funds for these purposes. Additionally, the author offers assistance in reaching out to bitcoin businesses and individuals to facilitate fundraising efforts.</summary>
