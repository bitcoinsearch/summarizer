    <summary>The email thread revolves around the relay/mining policy of CPFP (Child Pays for Parent) and RBF (Replace-By-Fee) transactions. The consensus rules cannot be applied to these policies because it is impossible to determine which transactions have been received by a specific peer and at what time. Consensus rules can only validate information present in the blockchain. The main focus of the discussion is to make CPFP consensus critical for all Full-RBF transactions, aiming to enhance the safety of RBF usage. While RBF is necessary for users to rectify mistakes, distinguishing between legitimate and malicious RBF transactions poses a challenge. To address this, the recipient needs to sign off on the RBF transaction they are aware of using CPFP. However, the implementation of CPFP is crucial as it should prevent the sender from signing off their own transactions. The proposed solution suggests allowing Full-RBF until the point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction. Any Full-RBF transaction that has not been signed off with a CPFP would be considered invalid for inclusion in a block, effectively turning it into a consensus rule rather than a local policy. This integration of CPFP and Full-RBF aims to make RBF safer to use.The author emphasizes the importance of CPFP in enabling merchants to bear the burden of fees. Combining CPFP with Full-RBF would greatly improve the safety of RBF transactions. Additionally, the author highlights the benefits of opt-in RBF, which eliminates the need for trust in miners. The inclusion of opt-in flags within transactions enables Full-RBF transactions to become a consensus rule rather than a local policy.In summary, this discussion explores the safety concerns associated with RBF transactions and proposes the integration of CPFP consensus to enhance security. The introduction of opt-in RBF and the use of CPFP would make RBF transactions safer and enable merchants to manage fees more effectively.</summary>
