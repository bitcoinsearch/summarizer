    <summary>The second Scaling Bitcoin Workshop is set to take place in Hong Kong on December 6th-7th. The workshop aims to address the scalability challenges of Bitcoin and provide potential solutions while identifying key areas for further research. Researchers, developers, and miners will have the opportunity to communicate and collaborate on Bitcoin development at this event.Technical proposals are currently being accepted until November 9th. These proposals can include designs, experimental results, and comparisons against other proposals. Authors have two options for submission: they can either give a 20-30 minute presentation or run an hour-long interactive workshop. Topics of interest for these proposals include improving Bitcoin throughput, layer 2 ideas, security and privacy, incentives and fee structures, testing, simulation, and modeling, network resilience, anti-spam measures, block size proposals, mining concerns, and community coordination.Accepted authors will be notified by November 16th and will have the opportunity to present their work at the workshop. All talks will be livestreamed and published online, including slide decks. This allows for a wider audience to access and benefit from the knowledge shared at the workshop.The deadline for proposal submissions has been extended by two days, with proposals now due by November 11th at 23:59 UTC. It is important for interested individuals to submit their proposals within this timeframe to be considered for acceptance. This workshop provides a valuable platform for the Bitcoin community to come together, share insights, and work towards improving the performance of Bitcoin.</summary>
