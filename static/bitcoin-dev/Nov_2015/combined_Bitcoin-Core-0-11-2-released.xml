    <summary>The author of the text has attempted to verify Wladimir's PGP keys, starting with the old key and then proceeding to the new one. However, he found that the signature of the new key was bad when visiting the website where it was referenced in a message signed by the old key. Despite this, the SHA256SUMS.asc file obtained from the magnet link posted in the same email verified using the new key. The email contains information about Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2, which is now available for download from the bitcoin.org/bin/ website. This update includes bug fixes, the BIP65 (CLTV) consensus change, and relay policy preparation for BIP113. It is highly recommended to upgrade to this version as soon as possible. The release introduces changes related to the BIP65 soft fork, which redefines the existing OP_NOP2 opcode as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV). This allows for the creation of unspendable transaction outputs until a specified point in the future. The release also applies the BIP113 rule to received transactions, meaning that transactions with a time greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will no longer be accepted into the mempool. Furthermore, the release addresses a bug in Windows where the UTXO database becomes corrupted on unclean shutdowns. This fix eliminates the need for frequent reindexing after such shutdowns. In the previous version, Bitcoin Core version 0.11.1, bug fixes, performance improvements, and the BIP65 softfork were included. Other changes included a fix for locking in GetTransaction, new rules for using GetMedianTimePast as the endpoint for lock-time calculations, and the ability to mine on top of old tip blocks for testnet. It is worth noting that downgrading to previous versions may cause compatibility issues due to changes in block files and databases. Overall, the release of Bitcoin Core version 0.11.2 brings important bug fixes and improvements, including the implementation of BIP113 and the fix for the corrupted UTXO database on unclean shutdowns in Windows. It is recommended for users to upgrade to this version to ensure a more secure and reliable Bitcoin experience.</summary>
