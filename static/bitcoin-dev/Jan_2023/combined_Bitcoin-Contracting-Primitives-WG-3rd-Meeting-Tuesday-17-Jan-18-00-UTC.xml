    <summary>The 3rd Bitcoin Contracting Primitives Working Group (WG) meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, January 17th at 18:00 UTC. Antoine Riard, the group leader, has proposed this date and time. The agenda for the meeting includes a thorough discussion of all contracting protocol use-cases and a review of the research in the contracting primitives/covenant spaces. Participants are encouraged to open a PR or contact Antoine if they have been working on a use-case that is missing from the current listing.The second part of the meeting will be dedicated to addressing any blockers that participants have encountered in their contracting primitives/covenant research. This will provide an opportunity for individuals to discuss any challenges or obstacles they have faced during their research.Antoine also shared his personal goal for the year, which is to nurture websites with archive material gathered in the repository. These websites would present the contracting protocol research according to the best engineering/scientific standards and ensure idea neutrality. Additionally, Antoine intends to collect feedback, particularly on dimensions like privacy or economic scaling, from the Bitcoin community of stakeholders at large, using Pretty Graphics (tm).In an effort to promote decentralization within the group, there are plans to start rotating the host of the monthly meetings during the year, similar to how it is done with BOLTs among Lightning implementations contributors. Anyone interested in hosting one of the monthly meetings is encouraged to open an issue against the repository or contact Antoine.For communication, the group uses the #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg channel on Libera Chat. Logs of previous sessions can be found at [0]. If anyone has questions or feedback, they are welcome to reach out to Antoine, the group leader.</summary>
