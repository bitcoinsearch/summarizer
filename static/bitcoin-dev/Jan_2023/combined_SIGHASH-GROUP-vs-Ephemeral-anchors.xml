    <summary>The comparison between SIGHASH_GROUP and Ephemeral anchors is a topic of discussion in the bitcoin-dev mailing list. SIGHASH_GROUP allows inputs of a transaction to divide the outputs into non-overlapping groups, while Ephemeral anchors are a relay policy level rule that creates a 0-value output with sPK of OP_TRUE, which is not considered dust if paid 0 fees and relayed with another tx.SIGHASH_ALL can be used instead of SIGHASH_GROUP by creating three transactions and signing them accordingly. However, ephemeral anchors have some limitations compared to SIGHASH_GROUP, such as being unable to duplicate the behavior of two signatures, one using SIGHASH_GROUP and the other SIGHASH_ALL. There are proposed rules for ephemeral anchors, including that a V3 transaction cannot have more than one ancestor, and it must be 0-fee, spent in the same mempool relay package, and nversion==3. Removing or loosening the v3.4b rule could allow ephemeral anchors to provide fees for multiple input/output groups, but it may introduce replacement issues. Overall, ephemeral anchors appear to offer most of the benefits of SIGHASH_GROUP, particularly with the potential to save on costs and consensus changes.The context provided includes a link to a mailing list for Bitcoin developers hosted on the website lists.linuxfoundation.org. The mailing list allows developers to communicate and collaborate on the development of Bitcoin.
