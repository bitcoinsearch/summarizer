    <summary>Alicexbt, a user on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list, has provided a detailed summary of the process for adding new maintainers to the Bitcoin Core team. The post outlines the recent addition of glowzow as a maintainer, as well as current efforts to add vasild as a new maintainer. Alicexbt proposes several changes to the current process, including opening a &quot;Call for maintainers&quot; issue when a new maintainer is needed, discussing nominated contributors in an IRC meeting where everyone can share their opinion, and avoiding self-merging pull requests.In response to Alicexbt's post, Michael Folkson suggests that there is some confusion around the process for adding new maintainers and pledges to look into the matter offline. He advises against &quot;ranting and raving or throwing toys out the pram&quot; on the mailing list and wishes everyone happy holidays.The post includes links to various pull requests, IRC meetings, and issues related to the process for adding maintainers. These links provide additional context and support for Alicexbt's proposals.Bitcoin Core has a list of present Bitcoin Core maintainers, which includes MarcoFalke, fanquake, hebasto, achow101, and glozow. Two developers that recently stepped down as Bitcoin Core maintainers are sipa and laanwj.The process followed in adding the recent maintainer, glowzow, involved nomination by fanquake, discussions in an IRC meeting, and a pull request opened by glowzow to add keys. The pull request received several ACKs, 2 NACKs, and 1 meta concept NACK, but eventually, everyone agreed to add glowzow as a maintainer, and the pull request was merged by MarcoFalke.Initiatives have been taken to improve the process and documentation for adding new maintainers. Jeremy opened a pull request that faced disagreements with the documentation and was later closed. Another related pull request was also closed with a comment from Jeremy that the desire to improve documentation seems to be missing based on reviews.Jeremy also nominated jonatack and vasild for a new maintainer in an issue which later got closed since nobody appreciated this effort to nominate self or others for a new maintainer. Similarly, an issue opened by the writer with the title 'Call for Maintainer: Privacy' received some comments that made no sense, and the issue was eventually closed.The process being followed for adding vasild as a maintainer involves volunteering by vasild, discussion in IRC meetings, and a pull request opened by vasild to add keys. The pull request received some ACKs and some disagreements from fanquake, dergoegge, and JeremyRubin. There was even a comment that disrespected vasild's contributions in Bitcoin Core.To improve the process of adding new maintainers, some suggestions include opening a 'Call for maintainers' issue if contributors or maintainers need a new maintainer, having discussions about nominated contributors in an IRC meeting, allowing everyone to share their opinion, defining scope for present and new maintainers, avoiding self-merging pull requests, and encouraging long-term contributors who are not living in a first-world country.In conclusion, Bitcoin Core needs to improve the process of adding new maintainers to ensure unbiased merging of pull requests. The organization should encourage contributions from long-term contributors globally and avoid politics while nominating new maintainers.</summary>
