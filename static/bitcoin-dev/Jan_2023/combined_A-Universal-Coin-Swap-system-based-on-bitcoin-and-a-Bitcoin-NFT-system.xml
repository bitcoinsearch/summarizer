    <summary>Aymeric Vitte, a French programmer, has put forward two innovative systems based on the Bitcoin blockchain. The first proposal is a Bitcoin NFT system that aims to provide a straightforward and efficient method for buying and selling NFTs while establishing ownership through blockchain verification. This system emphasizes the simplicity of Bitcoin compared to Ethereum, highlighting its ability to handle NFT transactions without unnecessary complexity.Unlike other solutions, Aymeric's NFT system stores proof of deals in OP_RETURN, allowing for the creation of bitcoin contracts. This approach ensures decentralization and prevents the network from becoming overwhelmed with excessive data. By utilizing a reputation model, trust in this system is established through one-time deals rather than relying on long-term relationships between parties.The second proposal introduced by Aymeric is the Universal Coin Swap system. This system aims to create a secure, decentralized, and cost-effective solution that can be applied to all blockchains and tokens based on Bitcoin. Unlike the Lightning network, which enforces strict rules, this system suggests relying on reputation models. Trust is built through one-time transactions, ensuring simplicity and ease of use.Aymeric believes that his proposals contain unique ideas such as the double hash and third-party involvement. These ideas enhance the potential of the systems and facilitate the sale of secret NFTs. Importantly, these proposals maintain decentralization, setting them apart from existing tools and wallets in the market.Aymeric welcomes feedback and reviews on his proposals, providing links to his CV, LinkedIn profile, GitHub, wallet, and other projects he has worked on. He argues that Bitcoin surpasses other systems in various aspects, positioning it as the superior choice for implementing these innovative solutions.</summary>
