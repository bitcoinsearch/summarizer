    <summary>Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, has announced the release of a first draft library for BLS signatures. These signatures have similar aggregation features as Schnorr signatures but can be performed non-interactively, albeit at slower speeds. The library, developed by the Chia Network, is fully functional and based on a musig construction. The announcement was made on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, where Cohen also mentioned a comparison to Shigeo's implementation.The new library developed by the Chia Network allows for non-interactive aggregation in BLS signatures. This means that parties can perform aggregation without any interaction, making it more efficient compared to Schnorr signatures. The library, which is fully functional, is based on a musig construction. The Chia Network is encouraging feedback, discussion, and usage of the library. Interested individuals can access the library on GitHub under the Chia-Network organization at https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures.</summary>
