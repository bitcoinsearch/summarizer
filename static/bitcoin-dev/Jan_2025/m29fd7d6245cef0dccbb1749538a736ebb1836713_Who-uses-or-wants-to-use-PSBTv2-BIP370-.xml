    <summary>Salvatore Ingala highlights the current state of Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) implementations within various Ledger client libraries. He points out that these implementations are basic and strictly tailored to meet the requirements of the communication protocol. They lack the comprehensive features one might expect from a general-purpose tool. Furthermore, there is no intention to expand their capabilities beyond this scope. This information indicates a significant limitation for developers who might be seeking more robust PSBT functionalities within Ledger's ecosystem.</summary>
