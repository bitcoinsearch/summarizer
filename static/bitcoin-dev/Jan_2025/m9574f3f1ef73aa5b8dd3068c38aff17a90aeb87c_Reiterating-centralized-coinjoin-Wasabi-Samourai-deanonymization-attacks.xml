    <summary>In a recent inquiry on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a participant raised a technical question regarding the possibility of creating an alternate public key (pubkey) with specific characteristics in the context of Schnorr signatures. The core of the query revolved around whether it is feasible to generate a new pubkey, referred to as p', that would not only validate a signature (s) signed by an arbitrary original pubkey (p) for a given message (m), but also validate both the original signature (s) and a new signature (s') for a different message (m'). The individual posing the question expressed skepticism about the feasibility of this within the Schnorr signature framework, while also acknowledging a lack of expertise in cryptography which might have overlooked pertinent details.

For further exploration or insights into this cryptographic quandary, the individual provided a link to Peter Todd's website ([https://petertodd.org](https://petertodd.org)) and contact information, suggesting a pathway for interested parties to delve deeper into the subject or provide expertise. This discussion highlights a nuanced aspect of cryptographic theory and practice within blockchain development, reflecting the ongoing dialogue and investigation that characterizes the field's evolution.</summary>
