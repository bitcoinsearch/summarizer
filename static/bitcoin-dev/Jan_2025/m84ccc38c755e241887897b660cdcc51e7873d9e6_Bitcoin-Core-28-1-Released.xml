    <summary>Bitcoin Core version 28.1 has been released and is available for download from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1) or via BitTorrent with the provided magnet link. This update introduces new features, various bug fixes, performance improvements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs they encounter using the project's GitHub issue tracker at [https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues). Additionally, those interested can join the announcement list through [this link](https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/).

For users upgrading from an older version of Bitcoin Core, it's recommended to shut down the existing application completely before proceeding with the installation of version 28.1. The upgrade process may require extra time if migrating from a version that has reached its end of life (EOL), particularly if the data directory needs to be migrated. It's noted that old wallet versions are generally supported by Bitcoin Core. Specific steps are provided for macOS users regarding self-signing of the Bitcoin Core binaries to comply with macOS security policies.

Bitcoin Core version 28.1 boasts compatibility with Linux Kernel version 3.17+, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 or newer. While the software may operate on other UNIX-like systems, these environments are not as rigorously tested, and using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended.

Significant changes in this release include adjustments to peer-to-peer (P2P) configurations. Specifically, when using the `-port` option, the default onion listening port will now increment by one from the specified port rather than being fixed to a default value. This modification aims to avoid startup failures due to port collisions in setups running multiple local nodes with distinct ports without using the `-bind` option. Further details are provided for users who manually configure their Tor `HiddenServicePort`, suggesting necessary adjustments to accommodate the new port derivation logic.

Additional updates encompass internal ID counting changes within addrman to int64_t, enhancements to key handling and secret data clearance in DecodeExtKey, and various build system improvements, including adjustments for mingw cross-compilation and NetBSD. The release also includes test enhancements, documentation updates, and miscellaneous code refactorings.

Contributors to this release, including both direct contributions and assistance with translations, are acknowledged, highlighting the collaborative effort behind Bitcoin Core's ongoing development.</summary>
