    <summary>In a recent exchange on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, there was a clarification regarding the correct version of Ledger's PSBTv2. The initial reference made to the PSBTv2 might have been to an outdated version. To rectify this, a new link was provided pointing to what is believed to be the accurate and updated version of the PSBTv2 library. The corrected link, as shared, directs to Ledger's GitHub repository, specifically to a file within the `app-bitcoin-new` project. This file, located at [https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/53dfd1727ab55182f9e365747b26b862e48b7b8b/bitcoin_client_js/src/lib/psbtv2.ts](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/53dfd1727ab55182f9e365747b26b862e48b7b8b/bitcoin_client_js/src/lib/psbtv2.ts), contains the most current version of the PSBTv2 library as per the discussion. The exchange underlines the importance of referring to the most up-to-date resources when discussing development tools and libraries, especially in a fast-evolving field such as cryptocurrency.</summary>
