    <summary>The discourse revolves around the evolution of the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) standard, particularly focusing on BIP370, a proposal aimed at enhancing PSBT by introducing backward compatibility and the capacity to append new inputs and outputs to transactions. This proposed improvement builds upon the foundational PSBT standard delineated in BIP174. Despite its potential benefits, the implementation of BIP370 within Bitcoin Core, as evidenced by pull request 21283, has not garnered substantial review or feedback from the community, highlighting a gap in collaborative development efforts.

Moreover, the conversation sheds light on the practical application and challenges associated with the current state of PSBT usage among various projects. Specifically, it mentions Core Lightning's adoption of PSBTv2, albeit with a noted inefficiency due to the necessity of converting back to v0 for compatibility with Bitcoin Core. This situation underscores the need for broader support and testing across different implementations to ensure the robustness and utility of the PSBTv2 standard in real-world scenarios.

Finally, the author encourages dialogue and collaboration within the broader developer community, inviting responses via Stack Exchange to foster collective progress in the adoption and refinement of PSBT standards. The engagement and insights from diverse projects would be instrumental in overcoming existing limitations and propelling the Bitcoin ecosystem forward. For further exploration and contribution, interested parties are directed to relevant resources and discussions through provided links, including the initial proposal ([BIP370](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0370.mediawiki)), the foundational PSBT standard ([BIP174](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki)), the Bitcoin Core pull request implementing BIP370 support ([#21283](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21283)), and a platform for community response ([Stack Exchange](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com)).</summary>
