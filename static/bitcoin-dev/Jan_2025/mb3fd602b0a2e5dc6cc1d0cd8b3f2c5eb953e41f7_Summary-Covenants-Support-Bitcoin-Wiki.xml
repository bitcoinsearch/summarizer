    <summary>The email emphasizes the importance of structuring tables in a way that highlights proposals actively up for activation within the Bitcoin development community. It specifically mentions three proposals: CovTools by Jamesob, LNhance by reardencode, and C3PO, which is attributed to the sender themselves, moonsettler. Despite acknowledging the submission of CovTools to the core, the sender expresses uncertainty regarding any ongoing effort to create an activation client for it. The tone suggests a missed opportunity to properly organize or present these proposals for what the sender refers to as the "Covenant Beauty Contest." This communication underlines the sender's perspective on the need for better presentation and recognition of active proposals in the community to possibly enhance engagement or awareness.</summary>
