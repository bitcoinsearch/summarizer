    <summary>In the latest discussions on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, contributors Salvatore Ingala and Kalle Rosenbaum have engaged in a conversation regarding BIP375, with a focus on sending silent payments using PSBTs. The discussion highlights the utilization of PSBTv2, notably the PSBT_OUT_SCRIPT field, as a critical component in this process. This advancement addresses the challenge faced when the output script is not known at the time of transaction creation. Traditional methods that require an unsigned transaction to include an output script are incompatible with this scenario, as outlined in version 0 of the protocol. The dialogue underscores the technical intricacies involved in enhancing the privacy and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions through innovative solutions like BIP375. This engagement is part of the broader efforts within the community to refine and evolve Bitcoin's capabilities, ensuring it remains a secure and versatile digital currency.</summary>
