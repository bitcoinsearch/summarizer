    <summary>The discussion revolves around the progression and current status of BIP370, a proposal aimed at enhancing the Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) standard initially outlined in BIP174. The primary advantage highlighted for BIP370 is its backward compatibility feature, alongside the critical functionality of allowing the addition of new inputs and outputs to a transaction, which marks a significant improvement over the existing standards.

Bitcoin Core has taken steps to integrate support for this proposed enhancement through pull request 21283. However, the adoption and review process appears sluggish, with minimal engagement from the community so far. The push for testing against other implementations is seen as a crucial step towards broader acceptance and refinement of BIP370. This approach would potentially streamline the review process by identifying issues or areas for improvement when PSBTv2 is utilized across different projects.

Core Lightning is mentioned as one of the early adopters of PSBTv2, although it faces challenges due to the need to revert transactions back to v0 to ensure compatibility with Bitcoin Core. This situation is deemed less than ideal, indicating room for further development and integration efforts within the ecosystem.
