    <summary>Antoine Riard has announced the fourth Bitcoin contracting primitives working group meeting, scheduled to take place on Tuesday, February 21st at 18:00. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss various topics such as ANYPREVOUT / "Eltoo" and the possibility of organizing an open meatspace event during S2 2023 or S1 2024 to enhance the development pace of contracting protocols. Participants have the opportunity to propose additional agenda topics in advance through the GitHub issue tracker.The meeting, which will be held two weeks from now, aims to address important matters related to Bitcoin contracting primitives. Two specific topics have already been proposed for discussion in the upcoming meeting. The first topic is ANYPREVOUT / "Eltoo," a work in progress that has been ongoing over the past year for Eltoo lightning channels. The second topic revolves around the potential organization of an open meatspace event during S2 2023 or S1 2024. These events are considered beneficial for accelerating the development of contracting protocols.If time allows, participants will also have the opportunity to discuss any blockers they may have encountered in their contracting primitives/covenant research. For those interested, the communication venue for the meeting is #bitcoin-contracting-primitives-wg on Libera Chat IRC. Furthermore, logs of previous sessions can be accessed for reference purposes.In summary, Antoine Riard has announced the fourth Bitcoin contracting primitives working group meeting, which will take place on Tuesday, February 21st at 18:00.
