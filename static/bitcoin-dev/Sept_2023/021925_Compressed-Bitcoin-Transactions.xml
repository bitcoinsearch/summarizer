    <summary>Tom has been thanked for posting something, and Andrew is requesting him to create a chart that shows the compression strength of a certain application. Andrew understands that analyzing the historical chain or average transactions won't give accurate numbers due to the specific nature of this application. However, he suggests including uncompressed/compressed sizes for "optimum" transactions such as a 2-in-2-out wpkh transaction and a 2-in-2-out Taproot transaction. He also mentions that it would be useful to have numbers for p2sh-wpkh and p2pkh, even though they are less common and less interesting. Andrew signs off with his contact information and a quote about the sun always shining in space.</summary>
