    <summary>The email announces the upcoming Bitcoin Research Day, which will be held at Chaincode in Midtown NYC on October 27th, 2023. The event aims to bring together researchers and developers to discuss the robustness, security, and decentralization of Bitcoin. It will feature both longer format talks by speakers such as Benedikt Bünz, Ethan Heilman, Ittay Eyal, Carla Kirk-Cohen, Murch, and Martin Zumsande, as well as lightning talks of approximately 5 minutes each to present ongoing research and development. Slots for the lightning talks are still available, and interested individuals can sign up using the provided link (https://www.brd23.com/lightning-talks). The organizers welcome participants from both the Bitcoin and Lightning Network communities to attend and contribute to the discussions.
