    <summary>The email starts with a question about the conclusion of a previous discussion. The sender finds it confusing and believes that the grammar of BIP 21 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 21) is under specified. They suggest that each parameter should specify how many times it can be repeated. In the context of lightning, people are asking about the possibility of having multiple invoices. This makes sense because everything is encoded inside an invoice, so a person only needs to know the invoice. The sender provides a link [1] for more information on this topic.The sender expresses their preference for working on improving BIP 21, possibly with a new version where only the grammar is slightly changed. They end the email with the word "Cheers" and their name, Vincent.</summary>
