    <summary>Decisions within the Bitcoin community have been criticized for happening in a closed-off manner, with discussions taking place behind closed doors or in private IRC channels. Michael, however, believes that a more open and collaborative approach is needed. He suggests integrating a bare bones Knots style Bitcoin implementation with Core Lightning to create a simpler and more efficient solution. This would avoid the need to re-implement consensus code in a different language, which many developers see as a better option. However, there are concerns about the potential complexity and effort required for such integration.The email thread also addresses the decoupling of CLN from the block source, allowing for a separation of concerns and flexibility in choosing a block backend. The idea of &quot;comingle&quot;ing the peering of LN gossip and block data networks is raised, but it has not been seriously pursued in the LN side. Additionally, there is a discussion about fee calculation and the need for a unified approach to ensure proper functioning of Lightning nodes.Overall, the email thread sheds light on ongoing discussions and ideas for improving the scalability and functionality of the Bitcoin network. It highlights the challenges and opportunities in integrating full nodes and Lightning nodes, managing the Bitcoin Core project, and enhancing the overall ecosystem.The libbitcoinkernel project aimed to extract the consensus engine from Core, but it has proven difficult due to the elusive nature of consensus itself. As a result, the model of Knots style consensus compatible codebase forks of Bitcoin Core seems to be gaining traction. However, merging Bitcoin Core and Core Lightning into one codebase would be a monumental task, according to Michael. He is seeking input from individuals well-versed in both codebases to explore ambitious long-term projects that could potentially combine these two entities.Despite the perceived lull in the chaos surrounding soft fork activation, the Bitcoin community sees this as an opportune time to delve into ambitious endeavors, even if they are purely conceptual at this stage. By focusing on such projects, the community hopes to foster innovation and progress within the ecosystem.</summary>
