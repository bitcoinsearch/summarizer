    <summary>In response to Carlo's proposal, Ariel Lorenzo-Luaces points out a flaw in the plan. Users would not know what to do if signaling is between 51% and 79%. This could potentially lead to a user-activated soft fork (UASF) that may cause concerns for other users, as they could be at risk of significant reorganizations in order to gain support. To address this issue, Lorenzo-Luaces suggests a Simple Majority Activation (SMA) proposal with a final activation threshold set at 51%. This eliminates the incentive for a UASF because if 51% is not reached, it indicates insufficient miner support to maintain the integrity of the chain.Carlo's proposal aims to modify the activation threshold for Taproot, but it has raised some concerns among users. The new proposal suggests an initial deployment with LOT=false and an activation threshold of 95% of miner signaling. If, after six months, Taproot is not activated by MASF, but at least 80% of hashpower signals for the upgrade, a lock-in date is set for another six months later, and the threshold for MASF is lowered to 90%. However, if the initial six months of signaling with LOT=false fail to reach the 80% threshold, the proposal expires.One of the main issues with Carlo's proposal is that it leaves users uncertain about how to activate Taproot if signaling falls between 51% and 79%. This uncertainty can lead to the potential for a UASF movement, which seeks to activate Taproot without the need for 21% to 49% of miners to signal. However, a UASF movement would require a hard fork to change the proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for protection and change addresses to prevent double spends if support is less than 50%. Such a movement with a miner majority can create fear among other users due to the possibility of significant reorganizations to gain support and followers.In light of these concerns, Lorenzo-Luaces suggests the SMA proposal with a final activation threshold set at 51%. This removes the incentive for a UASF because if the threshold of 51% is not reached, it indicates that there is insufficient miner support to maintain the chain's integrity. By adopting this approach, the risks associated with a potential UASF can be mitigated, providing a more stable and secure activation process for Taproot.</summary>
