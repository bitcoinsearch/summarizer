    <summary>The recent discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list emphasized the importance of achieving consensus for taproot and the activation mechanism. It was acknowledged that not all future soft-forks may receive as much support as taproot, making it crucial to approach the activation topic with patience and calm. Rushing into ill-considered decisions should be avoided.John Rand, in an email to the mailing list, stressed the need for positive progress on the activation topic. He stated that Bitcoin must prevail in achieving a future upgrade, even in the face of powerful interests counter to the interests of Bitcoin users and investors. In order to achieve this, the activation topic should be treated with decorum and tight non-emotive reasoning, devoid of frustration and impatience.Rand proposed incremental improvement as a way to handle complex and unintuitive topics. This allows people to learn as they go, rather than trying to solve everything in one step. Failure to upgrade or demoralizing protocol researchers could pose a systemic risk, considering that there will be more upgrades that Bitcoin will need in the future.One suggestion put forward in response to Rand's proposal was to have an incorruptible machine that gathers the highest fee transactions from the mempool and posts them every 10 minutes. This would make Bitcoin largely run itself. Additionally, it was suggested that forks could potentially become a diminishing issue over time.In conclusion, the discussion revolved around the importance of achieving consensus for future soft-forks and the need to handle the activation topic with consideration and decorum. The potential risks of failing to upgrade were highlighted, and suggestions were made for improving the activation process. It was reiterated that incremental improvement is key, and now is a convenient time to make progress in this area.</summary>
