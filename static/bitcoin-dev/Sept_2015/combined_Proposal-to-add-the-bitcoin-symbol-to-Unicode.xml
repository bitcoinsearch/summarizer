    <summary>Ken Shirriff, a member of the Bitcoin community, has proposed the addition of the B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol to the Unicode standard. Currently, the use of the bitcoin symbol in text is inconvenient due to its absence from Unicode. The proposal aims to avoid confusion with the Thai baht currency symbol, which also uses a B with a single vertical bar. However, there is a suggestion to use the already available B-with-horizontal-bar (Éƒ) symbol in Unicode instead. This symbol is already included in the Unicode glyph set and is available on most Unicode enabled devices. The argument against this suggestion is that using the Thai baht currency symbol for Bitcoin would lead to further confusion.Shirriff believes that adding the bitcoin symbol to Unicode is important to avoid confusion with other symbols and enable everyone to use the standard symbol. He has successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before and believes that this proposal has a good chance of succeeding. However, he hopes to receive endorsement from Bitcoin developers to help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol.The full proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. By adding the bitcoin symbol to Unicode, it will become much more convenient for users to incorporate the symbol in text. Shirriff has requested support from the bitcoin-dev group and provided contact information for Richard Moore, founder of Genetic Mistakes Software Inc., in the email thread. A link to the Bitcoin symbol page on en.bitcoin.it/wiki is also provided.In response to Shirriff's proposal, Theo Chino has sent an email asking how he can join and support the effort to have the bitcoin symbol added to Unicode. Shirriff believes that including the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol in Unicode will make using the symbol in text more convenient. He has confidence in the success of this proposal based on his previous experience in proposing a new character for Unicode. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. Shirriff has reached out to the bitcoin-dev group for their endorsement, as support from Bitcoin developers will help the Unicode Committee recognize the importance of adding this symbol.Bitcoin enthusiasts are facing difficulties in using the bitcoin symbol in text due to its absence from the Unicode standard. In response, Ken Shirriff has written a proposal to add the bitcoin symbol to Unicode. He believes that with endorsement from Bitcoin developers, the Unicode Committee will understand the significance of adding this symbol. The proposal can be found at http://righto.com/bitcoin-unicode.pdf. Shirriff also suggests running the proposal by the bitcoin-dev group for their support.</summary>
