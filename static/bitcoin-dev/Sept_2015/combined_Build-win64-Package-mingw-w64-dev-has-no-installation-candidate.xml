    <summary>During an email conversation between Joseph Bisch and Roy Osherove, it was observed that the TeamCity setup was using Ubuntu Trusty for builds, while Travis CI was employing Ubuntu Precise. This difference in operating systems led to an issue where the mingw-w64-dev package was only available in Precise. The email mentioned that the package had been divided into mingw-w64-x86-64-dev and mingw-w64-i686-dev, both of which needed to be used with Ubuntu Trusty. Relevant links to pages regarding these packages and operating systems were shared in the email.A user is attempting to recreate the Travis CI build system using TeamCity in order to gain a better understanding of bitcoin builds. However, they are encountering difficulties in acquiring mingw dev during the Windows builds, as they receive an error message stating &quot;Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no installation candidate&quot;. The user has attempted to use the same export environment variables as the Travis script and even tried implementing the Travis script within TeamCity, but the problem persists. The PPA (Personal Package Archive) appears to be importing correctly during the build process. The agent is running on a docker image based on Ubuntu.The user has shared the complete log of the failed build and is seeking suggestions as to why it works on Travis but not on the TeamCity build agent. They also mention that the same issue arises in the win32 build. In conclusion, the user expresses gratitude to everyone involved and provides their contact details.</summary>
