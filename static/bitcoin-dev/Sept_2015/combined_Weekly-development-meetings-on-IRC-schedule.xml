    <summary>Bitcoin developers held a discussion in September 2015 regarding the timing of their weekly IRC meetings. Vincent Truong suggested a meeting time from 23:00 to 00:00 UTC which could accommodate participants from the US and Asia, but it may not be convenient for everyone. Another proposal was made by Jl2012 to review the timing on a weekly or monthly basis using a doodle vote. Wladimir J. van der Laan took the initiative to create a shared Google Calendar for the meetings, scheduling them on Thursdays at 19:00-20:00 UTC starting from September 24, 2015, with the timezone set as Reykyavik (Iceland), which is UTC+0. This calendar can be added to personal calendars, displaying the meeting time in the respective time zones.Initially, there were concerns raised by participants from Asia and Australia about the inconvenience of the meeting time due to the time difference. In response, it was suggested to shift the meeting time to 23:00 to 00:00 UTC, which would be more feasible for people in Asia. However, it was acknowledged that accommodating everyone's preferences is challenging, and a monthly meeting at a suitable time might be a better solution. The proposed time change was open for feedback specifically from individuals in Asia and Australia.The introduction of weekly IRC meetings for Bitcoin developers was met with agreement from the group. A shared Google Calendar was created, indicating that the meetings will take place every Thursday from 7:00-8:00 PM UTC, starting on September 24th. To address the concerns of participants located in China, Japan/Korea, and Australia, it was suggested to review the timing of the meetings on a weekly or monthly basis to ensure inclusivity. Additionally, there were requests for an agenda to be published before each meeting, particularly for those who need to wake up during inconvenient hours to participate. The IRC channel for bitcoin-dev is logged at bitcoinstats.com.In summary, a weekly IRC meeting has been scheduled for Bitcoin developers on Thursdays from 7:00-8:00 PM UTC starting from September 24th. A shared Google Calendar has been created to display the meeting time in different time zones. The initial timing of the meetings may not be ideal for participants in Asia and Australia, leading to suggestions of reviewing the timing regularly. Furthermore, there were requests for publishing an agenda before each meeting to determine its relevance for attendees, especially for those who need to make adjustments to their sleep schedules. The adoption of the weekly IRC meetings was positively received, and a suitable time slot was determined through the Doodle site. The first meeting will take place on September 24th, and the shared Google Calendar can be added to individual calendars to view the meeting time in respective time zones with the help of the provided button.</summary>
