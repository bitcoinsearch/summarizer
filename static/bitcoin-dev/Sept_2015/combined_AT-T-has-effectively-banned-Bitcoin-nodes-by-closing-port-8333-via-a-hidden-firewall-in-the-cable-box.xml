    <summary>The legality of setting up a full node for Bitcoin from home is a contentious issue, with many ISPs prohibiting the network services that a full node would provide. Comcast, for example, forbids off-premise network "services," while AT&amp;T claims implicit admin rights to all "equipment" connecting to their network. To overcome these restrictions, using a VPN can offer privacy and flexibility in opening or closing ports. However, it may be beneficial for those with an AT&amp;T landline but not using their standard internet/TV offering to switch to a local ISP to potentially avoid blockage, censorship, and have a better privacy policy.Various observations show that different ISPs retain user data for varying periods of time. TWC and Comcast store IP and other information for at least six months, Verizon retains data for 18 months, Qwest/Century for one year, Cox for six months, and AT&amp;T retains data for more than a year. These data retention policies raise concerns about privacy.A specific user's struggle to open port 8333, crucial for running a full node, uncovered that their internet was being routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall. The customer service representative refused to disable the firewall, asserting their control over their own equipment. This incident exemplifies a potential reason behind the decline in Bitcoin nodes, as ISPs effectively censor the network.The message advises individuals who have an AT&amp;T landline but do not use their standard internet/TV offering to check with local small ISPs regarding their port policies. It is recommended to find an ISP that allows port forwarding for TCP and UDP to a specific port number (SOMEPORTNUMBER) and keeps port 8333 open. Additionally, if an individual has Fiber-to-the-Node (FTTN) service provided by a local ISP contracted with AT&amp;T, even if the local ISP has its own privacy policy, AT&amp;T's data retention policies still apply. To enhance privacy and bypass censorship, the message suggests using a VPN or setting up one's own VPN connection. Running Tor through the VPN is also mentioned as an option.The email includes an excerpt from Zach G via bitcoin-dev, who experienced difficulties opening port 8333 for an entire year. After extensive communication with AT&amp;T, it was discovered that the internet was being routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall. AT&amp;T refused to disable the firewall, citing their ownership of the equipment. This situation could be contributing to the decline in Bitcoin nodes, as ISPs are censoring the network without customer knowledge.Another individual had similar issues with Comcast involving a different port, leading them to testify in federal court as part of a class-action lawsuit against the ISP. The solution for this person was to switch to a business account, which allows firewall configuration and unblocked ports. It cost an additional $10 per month. Bitnodes.io is suggested as a resource to identify any ISPs blocking nodes. The writer has been successfully running a node through their business account.In another case, the author struggled to open port 8333 throughout the year, despite various attempts. The port appeared open on the router and computer, but it remained closed. Contacting AT&amp;T revealed that the internet was routed through a DVR/cable box with a firewall, explaining the closed port. However, AT&amp;T refused to disable the firewall, claiming their ownership of the equipment. The author believes this could be a cause for the decline in Bitcoin nodes, as ISPs censor the cryptocurrency without informing customers. To obtain a satisfactory response, the author had to escalate the issue to AT&amp;T headquarters and threaten to remove the equipment from the wall.Overall, the context highlights the challenges faced when setting up a full node for Bitcoin due to ISP restrictions, data retention policies, and the refusal of some ISPs to disable firewalls on their equipment. These issues have led to difficulties in opening ports necessary for running nodes and potential censorship of Bitcoin by ISPs. The message provides recommendations such as using a VPN, seeking alternative local ISPs, or switching to business accounts to overcome these challenges.</summary>
