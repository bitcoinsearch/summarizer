    <summary>In an email conversation dated September 7th, 2015, LinuXperia reached out for help on the Bitcoin-dev mailing list to compile Bitcoin Core on their Ubuntu Linux machine. They had followed standard procedures by running "./autogen.sh" and "./configure," but encountered a build error. Sriram Karra, a member of the mailing list, responded by pointing out that the Boost libs were not being found and questioned why LinuXperia was attempting to build with a custom lib directory.LinuXperia shared their configuration command, which included specifying CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for the custom lib directory. The error message indicated undefined references to various Boost functions, such as boost::filesystem::path_traits::dispatch(), boost::thread::physical_concurrency(), boost::program_options::to_internal(), boost::program_options::detail::common_config_file_iterator::common_config_file_iterator(), and boost::filesystem::detail::copy_file().It was suggested that LinuXperia may have used the wrong build option, which should have been "--with-gui=no." This could be the reason for the undefined references to Boost libraries. The conversation emphasized the importance of following the correct build options and dependencies when compiling Bitcoin Core.BTC Drake and ChinaTinte also reached out directly to LinuXperia after seeing the initial post and were able to help him solve the problem. Eventually, LinuXperia successfully built bitcoin-core from sources and expressed gratitude towards everyone who assisted, including the bitcoin developers.The email thread concluded by providing links to the Bitcoin-dev mailing list and instructions for signing up. Overall, the conversation highlighted the significance of ensuring the accurate build options and dependencies to overcome build errors in compiling Bitcoin Core on Ubuntu Linux machines.</summary>
