    <summary>Isidor is questioning the need for another side-chain to address the Bitcoin block size issue. He argues that the market can already determine the acceptance of Bitcoins based on the client versions of blocks they come from, allowing the market to rectify any discrepancies. Isidor believes that holding a conference in Montreal to solve a global issue like this centralizes Bitcoin. To learn more about the project and its technical details, Isidor directs readers to the project page and GitHub README.The author of an email wonders if people are tired of hearing about block size issues and suggests it's time to move on from these discussions. They propose that while scalability is important, other features should be discussed instead. The author also questions the amount of money spent on conferences and proposes a more direct way of accessing information.The author introduces their solution to improving the discussion around block size issues and references a method advocated by Hal Finney seven years ago. This solution has already been coded into the author's own project, Truthcoin. However, they invite competent C++ developers to have a 30-minute conversation with them and potentially complete the coding in just one weekend.For more details about the project, including information on the Bitcoin Block Size website and technical specifics available on GitHub, readers can refer to the provided links. Additionally, the author has created a Slack channel for further discussions on the topic.</summary>
