    <summary>On September 2, 2015, Jeff Garzik sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list sharing that he has created a repository containing the full text of BIP 100 discussion document in markdown format. The purpose of this repository is to check the BIP 100 formal specification before submitting it to the upstream bips.git repo. However, the previous email failed to include the link to the repository, so Garzik provides it in this message.The conversation within the email exchange discusses the concept of &quot;votes&quot; in relation to Bitcoin and the potential implementation of a fee market. It is unclear whether the voting process would be semi-automatic or fully automated. The number of options and values for votes can influence outcomes. The participants also discuss the newly introduced 1 MB floor in the bitcoin block size limit proposal. Luke Dashjr suggests combining certain rules and modifying the voting process to require 50% to set the limit floor. He questions why the new size limit votes must use 11 bytes of coinbase and suggests increasing the coinbase length to allow for 100 bytes in addition to the pushed height and size-vote. In a separate email exchange, Luke expresses concerns about the power to decrease the hard limit in the proposed BIP100. He suggests that miners have the ability to lower the block size locally or collectively without needing a vote. Luke also provides suggestions for improving BIP100, including combining rules, modifying the voting system, and increasing the coinbase length. Overall, Jeff Garzik's proposal aims to set a new 1 MB floor in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 100 (BIP 100) repository on GitHub. This would allow for future adjustments to the block size limit. However, some members of the community express concerns about the proposed limit being too high. Garzik suggests using a numeric value pushed after height instead of 11 bytes of coinbase for voting on the block size limit. He also proposes increasing the coinbase length to allow for additional bytes. Additionally, Garzik suggests combining rules to make it clear that the limit remains a part of the consensus protocol and modifying the voting process to require 50% to set the limit floor. In conclusion, Jeff Garzik opens a repository containing the full text of BIP 100 discussion document in markdown format on September 2, 2015. The purpose of this repository is to check the BIP 100 formal specification before submitting it to the upstream bips.git repo.
