    <summary>In an email exchange, Rusty provides feedback on a draft that outlines low-level specifications for a reconciliation-based transaction announcement protocol. He questions the use of the term &quot;requirements&quot; in reference to data and suggests that actors have requirements instead. Additionally, Rusty seeks clarification on how to encode q, a coefficient used to estimate set difference. He also requests clarification on whether it's one or two sets of truncated IDs per peer. Furthermore, he recommends removing the phrase &quot;To the best of our knowledge,&quot; from a statement about PinSketch being more bandwidth efficient than IBLT since he has implemented and experimented with IBLT and found it to be worse.The proposed specification includes salted short transaction IDs, which are necessary for efficient reconciliation. It also demonstrates how to compute sketches based on these IDs using simple Python scripts. Additionally, the specification introduces wtxid-based truncated transaction IDs, which can save a significant fraction of bandwidth. Agreeing on this specification would allow for the integration of more bandwidth-efficient relay protocols, such as Erlay.To prevent transmitting duplicate transactions, an extra round has been added where two parties explicitly map 32-bit short IDs to 128-bit truncated IDs. The draft provides all the necessary background information to understand the proposed work. It also specifies all the messages required for an efficient reconciliation-based protocol, along with new state variables necessary for the protocol's operation.Interested parties are encouraged to thoroughly read and review the draft. The proposed specification has the potential to significantly improve efficiency in transaction announcement protocols, making it an important development for the cryptocurrency community.</summary>
