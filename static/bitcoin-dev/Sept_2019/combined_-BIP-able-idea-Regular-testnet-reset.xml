    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Developer mailing list, Emil Engler proposed the concept of regularly resetting the testnet. This idea had previously been brought up and feedback was provided back in June 2019. However, new information has now been shared regarding signet, an alternative to testnet. Emil Engler is considering writing a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) about regularly resetting the testnet on a scheduled basis. The main premise behind this idea is to use every 210,000 blocks as the genesis of a completely new chain, essentially forgetting the old chain and ensuring that no chain can ever be longer than 210,000 blocks. However, there are several challenges associated with implementing this idea. One major concern is how to make it work with testnet3, which may require a hardfork. Another consideration is whether it would be feasible to change the chain while Bitcoin Core is running. Moreover, there may be valid concerns about potential planned attacks causing the chain to branch into multiple chains at each reset.Emil Engler is actively seeking feedback on this proposal, hoping to gather insights and perspectives from the community. The email provided links to previous discussions and additional material related to this topic, allowing recipients to delve deeper into the subject matter.</summary>
