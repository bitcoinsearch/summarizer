    <summary>The Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel Aviv conference provided a wealth of information for bitcoin developers. Bryan Bishop received an email expressing gratitude for the transcripts of talks from the conference. The training materials covered a range of topics including foundation topics, developing Bitcoin Core, Lightning network, and upgrades.In the foundation topics section, discussions focused on bitcoin data structures, blockchain design patterns, hardware wallet design best practices, and privacy concepts. Developers learned about various aspects of Bitcoin Core development in the Developing Bitcoin Core section, such as the bitcoin core functional test framework, debugging bitcoin, rebroadcasting, signet, and wallet architecture. The Lightning Network section covered topics like routing, sphinx and onion routing, and topology.The conference also delved into upgrades related to bitcoin, including accumulators, Taproot, BIP-securethebag, erlay, secure-fountain-architecture, elastic-block-caps, plasma cash, prism, and proof-of-necessary-work. Discussions centered around threshold scriptless scripts, scriptless lotteries, and the progress of zero-knowledge proofs towards trustless snarks. Private information retrieval methods for lightweight clients were explored, as well as scaling oblivious read-write techniques. Additional topics included zerolink-sudoku, txprobe, atomic multi-channel updates, payment channel recovery with seeds, and anonymous atomic locks.Overall, the conference provided valuable insights and knowledge for bitcoin developers. The availability of transcripts for all talks ensured that attendees could refer back to the information presented. With discussions covering foundation topics, Bitcoin Core development, Lightning network, and various upgrades, the conference was beneficial for anyone interested in bitcoin development.</summary>
