    <summary>The recent advancements in error code corrections for universal quantum computing (QC) have highlighted significant challenges, particularly as the number of physical qubits increases. This raises questions about the scalability of quantum computers and whether these challenges could lead to the discovery of new physical laws that might make the realization of practical QC intractable. Despite extensive efforts by well-funded research teams worldwide, the full potential of QC remains uncertain, especially concerning its impact on cryptographic systems like Bitcoin. The slow pace of consensus upgrades within the Bitcoin community further exacerbates these concerns, highlighting the need for vigilance against possible quantum computational attacks that could compromise digital ledger (DL) security.

One proposal to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing involves the introduction of a Proof of Quantum Computing (PoQC) mechanism. This idea, if feasible, aims to protect public key-exposed cryptocurrencies through innovative soft-fork implementations. For instance, older coins issued more than a decade ago could be restricted in their spending to a new "seal" PoQC mechanism. This would involve a unique spend-triggering process designed to safeguard exposed public keys from quantum attacks by making certain transactions mandatory or optional based on a consensus decision. Notably, the implementation of such a soft-fork would require specific technical adjustments, including the increased weight of unsealed PoQC transactions, to facilitate a smooth transition.

Moreover, there's an ongoing debate about the best approach to secure cryptocurrency against quantum threats without resorting to a single post-quantum cryptographic scheme prematurely. While some schemes like SPHINCS offer easier-to-understand cryptanalytic assumptions, others, including CRYSTALS and FALCON, have yet to be fully vetted. This uncertainty underscores the importance of exploring client-side solutions and the potential for smart contracts to adapt to post-quantum states. However, the broader challenge lies in establishing a consensus on the validity of new cryptographic signatures and ensuring that any transition to post-quantum cryptography does not disrupt the underlying principles of blockchain technology.

In summary, the primary concerns revolve around the feasibility of implementing a practical PoQC scheme as part of the full-node consensus rules, addressing the fate of QC-exposed old public keys, and defining client-side post-quantum measures that can be adopted immediately. Addressing these issues requires a proactive approach to minimize the risk to cryptocurrencies in anticipation of quantum computing advancements. This involves careful consideration of both technical and social factors to ensure the security and continuity of digital currencies in the face of evolving quantum computational capabilities.</summary>
