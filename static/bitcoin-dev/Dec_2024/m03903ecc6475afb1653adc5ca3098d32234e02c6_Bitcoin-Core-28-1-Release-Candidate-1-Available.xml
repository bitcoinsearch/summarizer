    <summary>The release candidate binaries for Bitcoin Core version v28.1rc1 are now accessible, providing the community with the opportunity to engage with and test the upcoming major version of Bitcoin Core. These binaries can be downloaded directly from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-28.1/test.rc1/). Alongside the binaries, the source code has been made available on GitHub, allowing for thorough review and compilation by developers interested in exploring the new features and changes introduced in this version. The source code is located under a signed tag, which can be accessed at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/v28.1rc1).

As part of the preparation for the new major release, preliminary release notes have been published to provide an overview of the updates, fixes, and enhancements included in version v28.1rc1. These notes are crucial for users and developers alike to understand the scope of changes and new functionalities being introduced. The release notes are available for reading at [GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v28.1rc1/doc/release-notes.md), offering insights into what to expect from the forthcoming official release.

Release candidates serve as a critical step in the software development cycle, aimed at identifying any remaining issues or bugs that need to be addressed before the final release. The announcement encourages recipients of the message, who are members of the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, to participate in the testing process. By doing so, they contribute to the stability and reliability of the upcoming version v28.1. Should the testing phase conclude without the identification of critical problems, the release candidate will be officially tagged as version v28.1, marking its readiness for widespread use across the Bitcoin network.</summary>
