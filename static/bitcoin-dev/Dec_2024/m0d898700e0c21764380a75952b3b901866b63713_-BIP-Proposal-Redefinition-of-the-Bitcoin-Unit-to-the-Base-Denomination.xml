    <title>[BIP Proposal] Redefinition of the Bitcoin Unit to the Base Denomination</title>

    <summary>In the recent proposal introduced to the Bitcoin Community, a significant change is suggested regarding the unit representation of Bitcoin. The proposal aims to redefine the "bitcoin" unit to align with the currency's integral accounting system. Currently, one bitcoin (BTC) is equivalent to 100 million base units, with values typically represented to eight decimal places. The proposed change would shift this representation, treating the smallest indivisible unit in the Bitcoin protocol as "one bitcoin." This adjustment would eliminate the need for decimal points, simplifying transactions and the general understanding of Bitcoin's value system.

The motivation behind this proposal includes several benefits aimed at improving the user experience with Bitcoin. By adopting an integer-based display format, it addresses challenges such as mental arithmetic complexity and user confusion stemming from the current decimal-based system. Additionally, it proposes a solution to future-proof Bitcoin's display format against the need for new fractional denominations, which could arise as the cryptocurrency continues to be adopted and its valuation evolves. Another significant advantage highlighted is the reduction of unit bias and the prevention of misinformation regarding Bitcoinâ€™s divisibility.

Moreover, the proposal critiques alternative suggestions like BIP 176, which introduced "bits" as a sub-unit for bitcoin. It argues that creating additional sub-units still necessitates thinking in terms of decimals and multiple denominations, which does not solve the underlying issue of complexity and confusion. The proposed shift to an integer-only display is presented as a clearer, more intuitive, and durable approach to representing Bitcoin's value.

For those interested in exploring the full details of the proposal, the draft text can be found on GitHub at [this link](https://github.com/BitcoinAndLightningLayerSpecs/balls/blob/main/BIP%2021Q.md). The author of the proposal, John Carvalho, invites feedback from the community to refine the proposal based on collective input, emphasizing the importance of community consensus in adopting such fundamental changes to Bitcoin's unit representation.</summary>
