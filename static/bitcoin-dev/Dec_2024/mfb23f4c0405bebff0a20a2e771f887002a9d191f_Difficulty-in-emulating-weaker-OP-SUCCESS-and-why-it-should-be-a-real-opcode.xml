    <summary>In a recent discussion, the handling of `CODESEPARATOR` segments within the context of Bitcoin's scripting language was analyzed, highlighting a predictable yet distinct approach to managing SUCCESS operations with conditionals. The method entails updating the success mode upon encountering a `CODESEPARATOR`, succeeding if execution is enabled by flow control and the success mode is active, and executing an operation if it is either enabled or a flow control operation itself.

Further examination of [BIP342](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki) revealed that tapscript designers envisioned a broader utility for the SUCCESS opcode, such as influencing the behavior of other opcodes or even modifying stack limits. However, integrating such functionalities with segmented SUCCESS could present challenges, suggesting that not all envisioned features might be compatible with segmented execution.

This discourse has led to support for the concept of a runtime success operator, potentially mirroring the functionality of the original RETURN opcode. This alternative could serve useful in scenarios where VERIFY is traditionally utilized, raising questions about the untapped potential of tapscript's `CODESEPARATOR`.

Additionally, the conversation touched upon the feasibility of implementing restored scripts in tapscript 0xc0, considering the introduction of new opcodes that could redefine existing ones, alter numerical representations, and adjust operational limits. The proposition includes offering a RESTORE opcode that solely activates a mode change, catering to scripts devoid of the new opcodes. This nuanced debate underscores the complexity and evolving nature of Bitcoin script enhancements, reflecting ongoing efforts to refine and expand its capabilities.</summary>
