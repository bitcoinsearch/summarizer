    <summary>This proposal introduces a requirement for Bitcoin miners to include a minimum of 0.1% of transactions from the oldest in the mempool, regardless of their fee levels, in every block mined. This initiative aims to tackle the issues of mining centralization and the potential for transaction censorship within the network. By enforcing the inclusion of old transactions with possibly lower fees, it seeks to prevent any single miner or group of miners from exerting control over transaction confirmations and maintain a level of democratic processing.

The motivation behind this proposal stems from concerns over the increasing centralization of Bitcoin mining activities and the possibility of regulatory pressures that could compel miners to selectively exclude certain transactions. Ensuring a mandatory inclusion of older transactions, even those with fees below the market average, is believed to mitigate the risk of censorship and promote fairness in transaction confirmations.

The specification details that each miner must incorporate at least 0.1% of their block's transactions from the oldest available in the mempool, prioritizing their age over transaction fees. This measure is designed to ensure no transactions are excluded based on fee size alone, promoting inclusivity. Moreover, blocks will only be validated by the Bitcoin network if they adhere to this criterion, with non-compliant blocks being rejected outright. This mechanism serves as an incentive for miners to comply with the rule to avoid missing out on block rewards.

The expected benefits of implementing this proposal include enhanced censorship resistance by disincentivizing miners from omitting transactions to manipulate outcomes or favor high-fee transactions. It also aims to foster greater inclusivity by guaranteeing the confirmation of older, low-fee transactions that might otherwise remain unconfirmed indefinitely. Furthermore, by reducing the likelihood of centralized control over transaction confirmations, this measure supports the continued decentralization of the Bitcoin network.

Several considerations accompany this proposal, including its impact on the mempool, which could become more dynamic and less congested with stagnant transactions. Miners may need to adjust their systems to efficiently identify and include the required transactions automatically. The adoption of this Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is seen as a critical step towards maintaining the integrity, fairness, and decentralization of the Bitcoin network, ensuring that all users have equitable access to transaction confirmations without bias towards transaction fees.</summary>
