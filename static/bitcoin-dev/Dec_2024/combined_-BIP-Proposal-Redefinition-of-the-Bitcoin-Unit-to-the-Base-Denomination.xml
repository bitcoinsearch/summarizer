    <summary>In a recent discourse within the Bitcoin development community, a novel proposal has been tabled that seeks to alter the conventional unit representation of Bitcoin. This proposition advocates for a radical departure from the current system, where one bitcoin is subdivided into 100 million base units (sats), each represented down to eight decimal places. The essence of the proposal is to recalibrate the unit definition so that the smallest indivisible unit in the Bitcoin protocol, currently known as "satoshi" or "sat," would henceforth be recognized as "one bitcoin." This change aims to simplify the currency's accounting system by eliminating decimals, thereby facilitating easier transaction processes and enhancing the overall comprehension of Bitcoin's value system.
The proponents of this change underscore several benefits designed to enhance user interaction with Bitcoin. One of the primary advantages includes simplifying mental calculations and reducing confusion associated with the decimal representation of Bitcoin values. By shifting to an integer-based display format, the proposal also seeks to preempt the necessity for introducing new fractional denominations as the currency gains wider adoption and its value increases. Furthermore, it addresses concerns related to unit bias and misinformation about Bitcoin’s divisibility which can affect new users' understanding and adoption.
Critically, the proposal contrasts itself with previous attempts to introduce new denominational units, such as BIP 176's "bits," arguing that these efforts fall short of resolving the fundamental issues of complexity and confusion due to their reliance on decimal points and multiple denominations. The push towards an integer-only display framework is presented as a more straightforward, intuitive, and enduring solution for denoting Bitcoin's value.
John Carvalho, the author behind this initiative, has made the draft proposal available on GitHub for community review at [this link](https://github.com/BitcoinAndLightningLayerSpecs/balls/blob/main/BIP%2021Q.md). Carvalho emphasizes the importance of gathering feedback from the Bitcoin community to refine and possibly adopt this significant change in how Bitcoin's value is expressed, highlighting the critical role of consensus within the community in effecting such foundational adjustments.</summary>
