    <summary>The discussion highlights a recent update on transaction examples within the Bitcoin Development community. Specifically, an example is provided to illustrate how a single 1c1p (one child one parent) spend without p2a (pay to address) can be executed. The example includes links to the transactions in question, with the parent transaction available at [mempool.space/signet](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/7a3768737ae4e20a556de6f475bfc74a13a8fda2287dbabbf6ffe8d7f5500de2) and the child transaction at [mempool.space/signet](https://mempool.space/signet/tx/3135e52ad30eb788d455549f4f09b55f887cdd2eb1660180b0e12f10af807cf5). This particular transaction setup is noted for its capability to incorporate the parent transaction into the mempool despite not including any fees.

Furthermore, the message mentions the addition of version 3 (v3) transactions and pay-to-address (p2a) to a CTV payment pool Proof of Concept (PoC), which can be found at [GitHub - stutxo/op_ctv_payment_pool](https://github.com/stutxo/op_ctv_payment_pool). This inclusion points towards ongoing developments and experiments in transaction processes within the Bitcoin network, suggesting an active exploration of more efficient or versatile transaction methodologies. 

This summary encapsulates the technical advancements shared within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, omitting farewell gestures as per instruction, and focuses on the key updates: the demonstration of a 1c1p spend without p2a and the introduction of v3 transactions and p2a in a CTV payment pool PoC.</summary>
