    <summary>Brandon addresses a misunderstanding regarding the script with a bug related to OP_VAULT, clarifying that he has not implemented this feature and it is not part of inquisition. He explains that his intention was not to present production-ready scripts but rather to demonstrate a proof of concept for how certain operations could be theoretically executed using proposed opcodes. Brandon emphasizes that the details such as 3DROP or 3DUP are not crucial at this stage and that his focus was on showcasing the potential use of CCV or VAULT in conjunction with Lightning Symmetry implementations.

He further explains that his publication included the expected stack progression and was open to corrections, indicating an openness to collaborative improvement. The relation between his work on opcodes not associated with LNHANCE and his efforts on Lightning Symmetry seems to be a point of confusion, which he seeks to clarify. Brandon's message is a defense of his approach to exploring and demonstrating the capacities of certain opcodes within the context of Bitcoin development, suggesting that any perceived offense was unintentional.</summary>
