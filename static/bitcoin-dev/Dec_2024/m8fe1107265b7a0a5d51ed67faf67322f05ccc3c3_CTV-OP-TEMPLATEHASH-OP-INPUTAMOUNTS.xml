    <summary>In the ongoing discussions within the Bitcoin development community, there has been a notable emphasis on addressing challenges associated with working with CTV (CheckTemplateVerify), particularly in the realm of vaults. Developers have been exploring solutions to circumvent these issues, leading to propositions such as OP_TX and OP_TXHASH/VERIFY. These proposals aim to expand functionality but also introduce complexities such as the reliance on 64-bit integer arithmetic for handling transaction amounts.

An alternative approach has been suggested that seeks to bridge gaps without resorting to state-carrying covenants or intricate introspection. This proposal introduces two new opcodes - `OP_TEMPLATEHASH` and `OP_INPUTAMOUNTS` - to enhance the utility of CTV. `OP_TEMPLATEHASH` is designed to construct a template hash from the stack, facilitating a more flexible interaction with transaction elements. The use of `OP_INPUTAMOUNTS`, exclusive to Taproot transactions, allows for the aggregation of input amounts based on specific criteria, thereby enabling a variety of transactional structures including those beneficial for vault withdrawals. This opcode supports various operations by calculating the sum of input amounts either in totality, from the last `abs(n)` inputs including the current one, or from the first `n` inputs of a transaction, with certain conditions applied to ensure operational integrity.

The significance of these additions lies in their potential to support complex contract structures, such as combining UTXOs locked by the same script for purposes like vault withdrawals to a staging address. This capability is particularly useful as it accommodates any amount of UTXOs, contrary to the limitations present in basic CTV vaults, and includes provisions for fee payments and change address registration within the contract itself. 

The conceptual groundwork for these proposals owes much to the contributions of several key figures within the cryptocurrency development sphere. Jeremy Rubin's earlier work laid the foundational ideas that these opcodes build upon, while James O'Beirne and Salvatore Ingala have been instrumental in advancing the understanding and application of vaults and covenant designs respectively. Their collective efforts underscore a collaborative push towards refining Bitcoin's programmability and security features.
