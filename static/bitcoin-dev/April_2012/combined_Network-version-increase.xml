    <summary>On April 2, 2012, a discussion was initiated by Jeff Garzik about the current numbering scheme being used, which stands at 60000. Pieter Wuille proposed two options for the future numbering scheme: either incrementing the number by one for every change or performing a "cleanup" to 100000 and then starting from there. Jeff Garzik voiced his preference for having 100000 as the baseline frozen protocol. Wladimir agreed with the idea of incrementing the number by one for now and not getting ahead of themselves.During an email thread on the same day, Pieter Wuille sought opinions on a numbering scheme. The current value being used was 60000, and the two options proposed were either incrementing the number by one for every change or performing a cleanup to 100000 before incrementing further. Jeff Garzik expressed his preference for having 100000 as the baseline or a frozen protocol.Meanwhile, Mike Hearn submitted a pull request to add a pong message in response to a ping. This change requires an upgrade of the network protocol version number, which has been independent from the version numbers of the reference client since BIP14. The current version number is 60000. Pieter is seeking opinions on whether to simply increase the number by one for every change or perform a cleanup and start incrementing from 100000.</summary>
