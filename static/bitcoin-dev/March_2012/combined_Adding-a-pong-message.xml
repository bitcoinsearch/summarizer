    <summary>TCP keep-alives are not always implemented reliably, causing difficulties in maintaining network connections on mobile devices in areas with poor connectivity. To address this issue, a new &quot;pong&quot; message has been added to the Bitcoin protocol on Github. This message echoes back a 64-bit nonce from the initial ping, allowing clients to quickly determine if a connection is stale or if a remote node is overloaded. This feature would be particularly beneficial for mobile clients. It was noted that TCP keepalives do not provide information about whether a node is overloaded, hence the need for the &quot;pong&quot; message. On March 13, 2012, Mike Hearn proposed the addition of the &quot;pong&quot; message feature on Github's bitcoin repository. The aim of this feature is to enable clients, especially mobile ones, to easily check if a connection is stale and avoid interacting with an overloaded remote node. By echoing back the nonce from the ping, users can determine whether a node is busy performing resource-intensive tasks such as downloading the blockchain. The implementation of this feature is intended to improve the overall connectivity of clients on the network.A recent pull request on Github for Bitcoin introduces the &quot;pong&quot; message, which echoes back a 64-bit nonce from the initial ping. This change aims to enhance the connectivity of clients, especially mobile clients, by enabling them to quickly determine if a connection is stale or if a remote node is overloaded. This helps users avoid interacting with nodes that are engaged in intensive tasks like blockchain downloads. The purpose of this update is to facilitate smoother client operations on the network. No specific concerns or objections have been raised regarding this modification.</summary>
