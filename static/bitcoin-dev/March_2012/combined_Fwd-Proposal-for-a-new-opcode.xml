    <summary>In an email sent on March 2, 2012, Watson Ladd proposed a new opcode for anonymous transactions. The purpose of this opcode is to allow scripts to be given proof that the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction. Ladd was working on a paper that discussed using this opcode for anonymous transactions. The idea behind the opcode is to prevent double spend attacks against anonymization schemes by validating an opaque signature.However, there seems to be some confusion about how this opcode enables anonymous transactions. Gregory Maxwell questioned its effectiveness and compared it to a hash locked transaction from the perspective of the blockchain. Ladd explained that the inability to blind a Lamport signature makes it different from a hash locked transaction. Although the draft proposal is not ready for anything official yet, Ladd is actively searching for a place to post it as it seems to be of interest.Gavin Andresen expressed excitement about the proposal and requested to read the paper for further details. He also mentioned that additional work may be required beyond introducing a new opcode in order to provide strong anonymity, such as creating new transaction types that clients can understand.Overall, Ladd's proposal aims to enhance anonymity in transactions through the use of a new opcode. Despite some confusion about its implementation, the idea behind the opcode shows promise for improving the security and privacy of transactions. Ladd is currently working on a paper discussing the use of this opcode for anonymous transactions, and it is generating interest within the Bitcoin community.</summary>
