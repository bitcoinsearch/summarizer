    <summary>In the email thread, Michael Gronager discusses his Libcoin project with Thiago Martins. They talk about the possibility of making Libcoin the official Bitcoin and syncing it with the mainline Bitcoin. Thiago expresses interest in using Libcoin with P2Pool and integrating it into the Diaspora* Project. He asks for help regarding compiling libcoin and encounters an error related to a missing file. Martinx thanks Michael for creating libcoin but reports compatibility issues with compiling it under Ubuntu 11.04.Michael announces the release of libcoin, a crypto currency library based on the bitcoin/bitcoin &quot;Satoshi&quot; client. He highlights its features such as being chain agnostic, having faster block chain downloads, and being a drop-in replacement for the bitcoin client. The build system of libcoin supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows using CMake. The license for libcoin is LGPL v. 3, allowing for use in both open source and commercial projects. Michael also provides support to Martinx for compiling libcoin and advises upgrading the boost library to avoid conflicts.Thiago seeks clarification on running multiple instances of bitcoind and encounters issues with default accounts not being listed. Michael suggests using btcd along with btc and upgrading the boost library to fix the issues. Thiago also mentions problems with authentication for certain commands. Michael explains that username and password need to be set up to access those commands.Throughout the conversation, contact information for Michael Gronager, including his name, address, mobile number, email id, and website link, is repeated. There is also contact information provided for Peter J. Vessenes, CEO of CoinLab, including his name and mobile number. Additionally, there is a sponsored advertisement for trying Windows Azure for free for 90 days and a link to subscribe/unsubscribe from the Bitcoin-development mailing list.Thiago reported an issue with the 'listaccounts' command in bitcoind, where his default account was missing from the output. Michael advised him to set up a username/password for accessing commands that require authentication and suggested upgrading the libboost-dev-all library to version 1.46.1.In another thread, Thiago encountered errors while compiling libcoin under Ubuntu 11.04. Michael recommended upgrading libboost-dev-all to resolve the issue.Michael announced the release of the libcoin cryptocurrency library, which is based on the bitcoin/bitcoin &quot;Satoshi&quot; client. The libcoin/bitcoind client downloads the entire block chain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client. The code has been refactored to encapsulate classes, remove globals, and adopt a pure asynchronous approach. Libcoin supports builds on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows using CMake. The license is LGPL v. 3, allowing use in open-source and commercial projects.Thiago had trouble starting bitcoind on high ports, but Michael explained that a username/password needed to be set up to access those commands. Michael also provided contact information for further queries.Martinx faced difficulties compiling libcoin on Ubuntu 11.04, and Michael suggested upgrading the libboost-dev-all library. Martinx mentioned successfully compiling other cryptocurrencies from sources.Ceptacle released the first version of the libcoin cryptocurrency library, which is chain agnostic and maintains all chain-specific settings from a single class (Chain). It supports builds on multiple platforms and can be used for research and educational purposes. Michael's contact details and links to the libcoin wiki, Twitter page, and download page were provided.A new cryptocurrency library called libcoin, based on the Bitcoin client, has been released by Ceptacle. The libcoin/bitcoind client can be used on the same files and scripts as the bitcoin/bitcoind client without modification, offering a 100% compatible drop-in replacement. Additionally, the libcoin/bitcoind downloads the entire blockchain 3.5 times faster than the bitcoin/bitcoind client, taking less than 90 minutes on a modern laptop.The Satoshi client code in libcoin has been completely refactored, properly encapsulating classes and removing all globals, with functionalities divided into logical units and libraries. The build system is based on CMake and supports builds of static and dynamic libraries on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Libcoin is chain agnostic, meaning that all chain specific settings are maintained from a single class (Chain). It supports various chains, including Bitcoin, Testnet, Namecoin, Litecoin etc. The libcoin license is LGPL v. 3, meaning it can be used under both commercial and open-source licenses with improvements required to be fed back into the libcoin library.Ceptacle, the company behind libcoin, is a technology company based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The company is headed by Michael Gronager who serves as the Director. Ceptacle's official website is http://www.ceptacle.com/,</summary>
