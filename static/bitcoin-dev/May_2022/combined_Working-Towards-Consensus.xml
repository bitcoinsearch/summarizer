    <summary>In recent discussions on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, members have engaged in a debate about the process of proposing new features for Bitcoin. The argument revolves around whether designers and developers should take the lead or if demand from the market should drive the development of new features. Concerns were raised about the potential centralization and harm to fungibility that could result from adding complex features to Bitcoin's base layer.One proposed feature called CTV (CheckTemplateVerify) was also discussed, with members examining its simplicity and effectiveness. The importance of defending consensus and focusing on features that everyone wants, rather than speculative additions, was emphasized during the conversation.However, personal attacks were made during the discussion, leading to criticism from others. This has caused confusion and fear within the Bitcoin community, particularly in light of a recent attempt to activate a contentious soft fork. To prevent such incidents in the future, it is suggested that personal attacks be avoided, technical details be carefully considered, and all posts read thoroughly to understand various opinions. Additionally, there is a need to better document Bitcoin's technical consensus process.The Bitcoin technical community needs to evaluate and propose upgrades to enhance Bitcoin's capabilities for self-sovereignty, privacy, scalability, and decentralization. Concerns regarding negative potential of covenants should be addressed, and the trade-offs between levels of functionality should be explained. Discussions on activation and release mechanisms also need to be renewed.John Carvalho argues that consensus can be reached by proposing features that everyone needs, but this statement is met with disagreement as not all features are necessary for all users. He emphasizes the importance of designers solving problems with designs rather than speculative additions. On the other hand, Billy Tetrud stresses the significance of consensus and education in decision-making, urging people to avoid personal attacks and focus on technical details when discussing proposals.Jeremy Rubin, in response to recent controversy surrounding his post on BIP-119, apologizes for any confusion caused and proposes efforts to better document Bitcoin's technical consensus process. He believes it is crucial to address concerns about covenants, renew conversations about activation and release mechanisms, and systematize knowledge around covenant technologies. Despite expecting messy discourse, Rubin invites feedback from the community.Overall, consensus and collaboration within the Bitcoin community are highlighted as vital for the network's success.</summary>
