He plans to use BitCoin as one of the main examples in his talk to highlight the importance of programs like BitCoin having their own private storage apart from $HOME. To ensure that he does not misrepresent BitCoin, Rob is requesting for someone to review his slides. He welcomes anyone who can help him by reviewing his (open office) slides, and is willing to email them for review.</summary>
