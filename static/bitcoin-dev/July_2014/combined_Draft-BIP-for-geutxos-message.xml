    <summary>The conversation revolves around the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) for querying multiple nodes and combining their answers. The proposal suggests this as a partial solution, but there are concerns raised about its security. Jeff Garzik highlights the lack of discussion on this choice in the BIP and proposes adding a warning label and documenting the weaknesses in the security considerations section. The respondent agrees to make changes and offers to send a diff with proposed modifications.In another discussion, Jeff Garzik expresses concerns about the security of querying multiple nodes and combining their answers, suggesting that it should only be used as a last resort. Mike Hearn responds by pointing out that the writeup attached to the implementation pull request covers how to secure the proposal, but acknowledges the need for improvement. There is mention of comparing this proposal to BIP 35, but it is argued that they are not comparable. The writer agrees to fix any misleading parts of the BIP.The conversation also touches on the draft BIP for 'getutxo' proposed by Mike Hearn. It mentions the usefulness of querying UTXOs and the security issue of an untrusted view. The BIP describes two new messages, 'getutxos' and 'utxos', and defines their fields. The protocol has a similar security model to Bloom filtering but lacks authentication. The writer suggests including a method to solve this security issue in the BIP.The pull request for the draft BIP for getutxo is discussed, emphasizing the purpose of performing UTXO lookups. Two new messages, 'getutxos' and 'utxos', are defined, and support can be indicated through protocol version and NODE_GETUTXO flag settings.In summary, the conversation involves discussions about the security concerns and proposed changes for the BIP on querying multiple nodes and combining their answers. It also covers the draft BIP for getutxo, highlighting its purpose and the need for addressing security issues.</summary>
