    <link href="https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/ZgQXHpraCWeEyDKe@petertodd.org/T/#m78fe8bb513c5c98626dd8f415364272cb47a6e0c" rel="alternate"/>
    <summary>The discourse presented highlights a cybersecurity issue related to free-relay attacks, indicating that the recent attack is an extension of previously known vulnerabilities. The point made clear is that these types of attacks are not entirely preventable, suggesting that we must adapt to living with a certain level of risk associated with free relay capabilities. This perspective challenges the arguments against Replace-By-Fee-Rate (RBFR) by underscoring the inevitability of such security threats, essentially arguing that public awareness and discussion about the various possible free-relay attacks could benefit the RBFR approach.

Furthermore, the individual expresses skepticism regarding the necessity for formal disclosure timelines for this specific attack, given its nature as a minor variation on existing threats. This stance implies a nuanced understanding of the cybersecurity landscape, where not every new attack warrants the same level of procedural response. The emphasis on open discourse about these vulnerabilities serves to highlight a broader strategy in dealing with them, one that involves acknowledgment rather than denial of their existence.

For more detailed insights, the person has shared a link to their website, [Peter Todd](https://petertodd.org), inviting further exploration of these ideas. This sharing of resources underscores a commitment to fostering a well-informed community capable of engaging with complex security challenges.</summary>
