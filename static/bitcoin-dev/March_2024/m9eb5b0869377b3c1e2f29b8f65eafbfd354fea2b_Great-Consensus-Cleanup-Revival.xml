    <summary>Antoine Poinsot recently initiated a discussion regarding the Great Consensus Cleanup, directing attention to a detailed post on [DelvingBitcoin.org](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/great-consensus-cleanup-revival/710). This initiative aims to gather feedback and opinions from a broader audience beyond the Delving platform. The focus of this cleanup revolves around several key issues and proposed solutions within the Bitcoin network's consensus mechanism, highlighting areas of concern and potential improvements.

One significant concern raised by Poinsot is the alarming block validation times, which could potentially compromise the network's efficiency and security. To counteract this issue, while existing mitigation strategies devised by Matt are acknowledged for their effectiveness, Poinsot suggests implementing an additional measure by restricting the maximum size of legacy transactions. This proposal aims to provide an extra layer of safety, ensuring more consistent and manageable validation times.

The timewarp bug, often underestimated in its potential impact, is another critical flaw that Poinsot believes warrants more urgent attention than it currently receives. Addressing and rectifying this bug is deemed essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of the network. Furthermore, Poinsot advocates for a definitive solution to ensure the uniqueness of coinbase transactions. By resolving this issue, it would eliminate the necessity for BIP30 validation post-block 1,983,702, thereby streamlining transaction processing and enhancing security.

Additionally, the discussion touches upon the validity of transactions based on their size, specifically suggesting that transactions under 64 bytes should remain valid, while those exactly 64 bytes should be unequivocally invalidated. This distinction is proposed without a strong inclination to further restrict transaction sizes below this threshold, indicating a targeted approach towards optimization rather than broad, sweeping changes.

Poinsot's inquiry extends to the community for further input, seeking disagreements, overlooked issues, or potential enhancements to the proposals presented. The goal is to foster a collaborative environment where constructive criticism and novel ideas can lead to a more robust and efficient consensus mechanism for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
