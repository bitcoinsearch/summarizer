    <summary>FROST represents a significant advancement in Bitcoin technology, particularly due to its Schnorr-based signature capabilities and its support for Distributed Key Generation (DKG). This development is crucial as it ensures that a private key is never localized to a single point, enhancing security significantly. Despite its potential, Bitcoin has seen limited integration with FROST until recently. Efforts have been made to bridge this gap by integrating the ZF FROST library with BDK. This integration aims to demonstrate the process of signing Bitcoin Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) with FROST, including adjustments for the Taproot tweak.

Two demonstrations were recently produced to showcase these advancements. The first focuses on a Trusted Dealer setup, providing resources such as a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8csdApREJIs), a [code walkthrough](https://hackmd.io/y6EYPYR0SluE0M0az7Y3uw), and additional [notes](https://hackmd.io/@bc-community/H1MfEMdvel). The second demonstration delves into Distributed Key Generation, similarly offering a wide range of resources including a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13skzOvWklk), a [code walkthrough](https://hackmd.io/cI9OVAbzSDemrcvsf9t0ag), and more detailed information. These efforts are part of a broader initiative to enhance understanding and practical knowledge of FROST among developers, complementing existing tutorials like "Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line", which can be found [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).

The project has convened multiple FROST meetings, bringing together developers and implementers to push the real-world application of FROST technology further. A full list of these major meetings and their outcomes is available [online](https://developer.blockchaincommons.com/frost/events), with plans to continue these gatherings through additional sessions scheduled for the fall. These meetings serve not only as a platform for discussion and learning but also as an opportunity for projects and code related to FROST to be showcased.

Support from various organizations and individuals, including the Human Rights Foundation, Foundation Devices, Unchained Capital, and notable community members like Jesse Posner, Brian Bishop, Jameson Lopp, and Glenn Willen, has been instrumental in advancing this work. For those interested in supporting or getting involved with the project, opportunities are available through direct contact or via [Blockchain Commons' GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons). This initiative reflects a collective effort to enhance Bitcoin's security and functionality through innovative technological integrations like FROST.</summary>
