    <summary>The concern raised revolves around the implications of using a certain approach to authenticate Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) holders in the context of quantum computing's emergence. The critique points out that this method could paradoxically exacerbate security issues rather than mitigate them. Specifically, it is argued that by hindering the transfer of funds to quantum-safe addresses, the system inadvertently extends the window during which the Cryptographic Quantum Computing (CRQC) can attempt to crack exposed public keys. This scenario is viewed as counterproductive, essentially facilitating a situation where Bitcoin miners, leveraging their significant hashrate advantage, could be incentivized to focus on cracking these Proof of Work (PoW) locked coins rather than performing their primary function of securing the network through block discovery. 

This critique underscores a fundamental flaw in the proposed strategy, emphasizing that it could lead to a perverse economic incentive structure. Miners might find it more lucrative to exploit the vulnerabilities of PoW-locked coins than to contribute positively to network security. Such a shift in focus could undermine the integrity and foundational principles of mining, turning what is intended as a security measure into an exploitative opportunity, disproportionately benefiting those with substantial computational power. The communication concludes with a clear stance against the adoption of this method, highlighting concerns over its potential to weaken the network's defenses against quantum attacks rather than strengthen them.</summary>
