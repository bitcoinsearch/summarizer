    <summary>The email raises concerns about the implications of using proof of work (PoW) to lock coins as a security measure against the potential threats posed by quantum computing to the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model in Bitcoin. The sender questions the effectiveness of this strategy, suggesting it might actually exacerbate security issues rather than mitigate them. Specifically, they argue that locking coins through PoW would prevent holders from transferring their assets to quantum-safe addresses, inadvertently giving the Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) additional time to crack exposed public keys. This scenario could lead to a situation where the hashrate advantage of Bitcoin miners turns into a vulnerability, as these miners might be incentivized to focus on cracking PoW-locked coins for profit rather than contributing to network security through traditional mining activities.

Furthermore, the email implies that such a shift in miners' focus could undermine the economic incentives underpinning the mining process. By potentially earning more from breaking into locked coins than from securing the network, miners might deprioritize their role in validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain's integrity. This change could not only weaken the network's security framework but also disrupt the balance of rewards that encourages participation in the mining process. The sender clearly expresses skepticism regarding the proposed use of PoW locking as a countermeasure to quantum computing threats, suggesting that it might lead to unintended negative consequences for the Bitcoin ecosystem.</summary>
