    <summary>In a recent discussion on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, the concept of 'distributed autonomy' versus 'distributed authoritarianism' was brought to attention. The clarification provided emphasizes that 'authoritarianism' inherently involves centralized, imposed control, which starkly contrasts with the principles of individual autonomy and agency. When individuals within a network make decisions such as filtering, blocking, or setting personal boundaries, they are exercising personal autonomy rather than imposing authoritarian control over others. This distinction is crucial in understanding the dynamics within decentralized systems and networks, where the emphasis lies on the empowerment of individual choices and freedoms rather than on centralized decision-making authority. The conversation underlines the importance of recognizing and respecting the autonomy of participants within distributed systems, acknowledging that the actions taken by these individuals are expressions of their own agency.</summary>
