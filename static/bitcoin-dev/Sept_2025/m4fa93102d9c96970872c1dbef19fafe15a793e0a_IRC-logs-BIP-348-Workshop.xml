    <summary>The CHECKSIGFROMSTACK workshop, facilitated by Michael Zaikin on the ctv-csfs-activation IRC channel at Libera, brought together Bitcoin developers for an in-depth session. The workshop focused on discussing the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), exploring its various use cases, and engaging participants in creating transactions. To ensure that those who could not attend have access to the discussions and outcomes of the workshop, logs have been made available [here](https://ctv-csfs-workshops.github.io/bip348/logs).

Acknowledgment was given to Michael Zaikin for hosting the workshop and to all participants who joined the channel, highlighting the collaborative effort within the community. Additionally, information about the next workshop, scheduled for 18 September 2025 at 15:00 UTC on the ctv-csfs-activation channel on libera.chat, was shared. This upcoming session aims to delve into the creation of different types of pools using CTV and CSFS, alongside a discussion on their respective pros and cons, demonstrating a continued commitment to advancing Bitcoin development through collective knowledge sharing and technical examination.</summary>
