    <summary>The discussion opens with a recommendation that future implementations should aim to integrate with version 1.3.0, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a unified project history and avoiding compatibility issues. This version is highlighted for its advancements in unit testing and composability, offering a contrast to Ethan's original repository, which has not seen updates for approximately four years and lacks the improvements found in 1.3.0. The original repository is accessible via [Ethan's original repo](https://github.com/ethankosakovsky/bip85), yet it is noted for its stagnancy and lack of recent development efforts.

Further points of concern include the utilization of the human-readable prefix (hrp) and its ambiguous implementation details. The current documentation does not clearly define how hrps, traditionally numerical path segments, should be translated into a numerical representation when they default to "ms". This ambiguity extends to the identifiers' (idX) role, nature, and how they structurally fit within the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS), indicating a need for clearer guidance for implementers on both fronts.

To address these issues, a proposal is made suggesting minor modifications to the diff to enhance clarity. Specifically, it calls for a more detailed breakdown and explanation of each path segment, aiming to resolve confusion surrounding the hrp's application and the structural role of identifiers. This approach seeks to simplify the integration process for future contributors by providing explicit instructions and clarifications on previously vague aspects.</summary>
