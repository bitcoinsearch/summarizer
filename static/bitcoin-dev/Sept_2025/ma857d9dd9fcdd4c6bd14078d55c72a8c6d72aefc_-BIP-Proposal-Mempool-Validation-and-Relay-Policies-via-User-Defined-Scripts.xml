    <summary>Aiden McClelland has initiated a discussion on a new draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) aimed at introducing a modular mempool/relay policy, which is accessible for review and comments at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1985). This proposal seeks to address the ongoing conflicts within the Bitcoin community concerning relay policies by offering an alternative solution that avoids the need for running various node implementations or forks whenever there are disagreements. 

McClelland is currently developing a reference implementation for this BIP using Bellard's QuickJS. However, he acknowledges the challenges he faces due to his prolonged hiatus from C++ programming, nearly a decade, which might result in the initial code not adhering to best practices. Despite these hurdles, the focus is on creating a working model that can later be refined to meet the required standards. This effort underscores a significant step towards harmonizing differing views within the Bitcoin development community by providing a flexible framework for relay policies.</summary>
