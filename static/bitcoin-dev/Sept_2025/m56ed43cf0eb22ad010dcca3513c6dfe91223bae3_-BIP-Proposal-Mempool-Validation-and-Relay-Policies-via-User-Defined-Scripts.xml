    <summary>The discussion initiated by Aiden McClelland and followed up by Chris Guida delves into the core functionality of the mempool within cryptocurrency networks, particularly emphasizing its role in modeling potential transactions for mining. Guida critiques the notion of deviating from this primary function, suggesting that any significant departure not only undermines the system's integrity but also fosters centralization—a move away from the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. He argues that the costs associated with implementing technology geared towards extensive censorship far outweigh any perceived marginal benefits such an approach might offer.

Further, Guida advises those who see merit in this direction to reconsider their choice of cryptocurrency, implying that the essence of most, if not all, cryptocurrencies is fundamentally at odds with authoritarian measures. His stance underscores a belief in maintaining the foundational principles of transparency and decentralization in cryptocurrency development, hinting at a broader consensus within the community against the adoption of practices that could lead to centralized control or manipulation of transaction flows within the network.</summary>
