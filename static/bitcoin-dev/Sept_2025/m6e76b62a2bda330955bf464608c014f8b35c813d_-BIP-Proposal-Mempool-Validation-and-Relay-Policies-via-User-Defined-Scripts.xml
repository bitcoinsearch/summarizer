    <summary>Aiden McClelland conveyed his perspective to Greg Maxwell regarding the debate on user autonomy in setting relay policies within Bitcoin's framework. Aiden acknowledged the compelling arguments made by Greg, expressing appreciation for the detailed explanation of his stance. Despite understanding Greg's viewpoint, Aiden remained uncertain about the potential for compromise and was skeptical about the feared significant censorship of legitimate transactions that might arise from allowing users this level of control.

Aiden emphasized the fundamental principle that users should have the freedom to decide which code governs their operations in the Bitcoin ecosystem, as well as in other technological realms. He highlighted his commitment to supporting even the least technically adept users, enabling them to exercise this freedom securely. Currently, this support has manifested in assisting some users with running Knots, an alternative Bitcoin implementation. Aiden also expressed openness to collaboration with Greg on strategies to transition these users back to Bitcoin Core, the primary software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, should a feasible approach be identified.</summary>
