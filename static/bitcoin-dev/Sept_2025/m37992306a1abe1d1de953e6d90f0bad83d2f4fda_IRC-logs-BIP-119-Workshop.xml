    <summary>In the realm of Bitcoin development, an upcoming workshop is scheduled to take place on 11 September 2025 at 15:00 UTC. This event is set to be hosted on the ctv-csfs-activation channel on libera.chat. The primary focus of this workshop revolves around two critical areas within the Bitcoin protocol enhancement efforts: the review and comprehension of BIP 348 and the creation of CSFS transactions on signet. For those interested in deepening their understanding or contributing to these technical discussions, detailed logs from previous workshops are available for review at [https://ctv-csfs-workshops.github.io/bip119/logs](https://ctv-csfs-workshops.github.io/bip119/logs).
