    <summary>Ben Westgate has recently made a proposal to integrate BIP-0093, known as codex32, with BIP-0085. This integration aims to generate deterministic entropy from BIP32 Keychains, which can then be used for creating codex32 backups directly from BIP-0032 master keys. Codex32 offers several benefits over the current system, including human-readable formats, checksumming, share indexing, and is particularly designed for Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) backups of BIP-0032 seeds. The proposition is detailed in the proposal available at [BIP-0093](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0093.mediawiki), highlighting codex32's enhanced error correction capabilities, hand verification features, identifiers, and secret sharing attributes, which collectively surpass the functionalities offered by BIP-39.

The initiative seeks to standardize the generation of codex32 backups using entropy derived from BIP-85, reflecting a similar application like the enhancements BIP-85 brought to BIP-39. It emphasizes the added value codex32 brings to the table, supported by test vectors and reference implementations outlined within the proposal. Despite the current limited adoption levels of codex32 by wallet providers, there's a notable momentum with a draft PR 32652 for Bitcoin Core to support the import of codex32 strings, demonstrated at [PR 32652](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32652?utm_source=chatgpt.com). An alternative suggestion for codex32 implementers involves leveraging BIP-85's dice application, intending to enhance interoperability and user-friendliness across different platforms.

In response to Westgate's proposal, feedback was provided to further refine and clarify the implementation details. Specifically, suggestions were made to include explicit pseudocode for the DRNG to 5-bit extraction process to minimize variations in implementation and to elevate the 'threshold == 0 implies n == 1' rule from a mere note to a normative requirement, ensuring clarity for implementers. Following this feedback, modifications were made to the original proposal, including the addition of a column and row to the n table to address the t==0 constraint on n and the removal of notes in favor of direct normative statements, particularly clarifying that when the threshold is "0", n must be "1", resulting in a codex32 secret. These updates have been incorporated into the proposal and are reflected in the latest commit available for review at [BenWestgate's GitHub commit](https://github.com/BenWestgate/bips/commit/fa6e9788bf04d271792ed4ea89a112d12284ef02).</summary>
