    <summary>The concept of time plays a significant role in the world of cryptocurrencies, as explored in the first article. Miners of Bitcoin act similarly to Maxwell's Demon by only accepting and broadcasting &quot;cold&quot; block headers over the blockchain. The article proposes the use of Cryptographic Relays as a means to implement an unforgeable proof-of-time-passing, advocating for standardization and encouraging multiple manufacturers to follow the same standard. This would eliminate the need for blockchain proliferation and reduce bandwidth consumption. The practical deployment of Cryptographic Relays is also discussed, particularly for smart devices that can recognize their owner and be used only by authorized operators.However, it is important to note that engaging in illegal activities such as stealing and hotwiring electric cars, as mentioned in the second context, should not be encouraged. The author explains how one can easily hotwire a car and splice wires across the cryptographic relays of other components. Ethical and legal practices should always be followed when dealing with vehicles.The article delves into the concept of a Cryptographic Relay, which is an electrical component that enables control of an electrical circuit using a public key. It can be used in Succinct Atomic Swaps, allowing for atomic swaps between assets that do not exist in a single asset-assignment system. However, transporting this construction over the Lightning Network poses challenges due to different timeouts at each forwarding hop. To address this, the article suggests giving the Cryptographic Relay a notion of time that makes it compatible with PTLCs routed over Lightning. This can be achieved using block header hashes as a low-entropy measure of time passing.The article also discusses the concept of Maxwell's Demon, which guards a hole between two containers and allows high-temperature molecules to pass from one side to another. The use of Cryptographic Relays allows lenders to verify ownership of a car without the need for a centralized third party. It also proposes a simple and secure ownership transfer and delegation of operators, making it suitable for use in smart devices. The potential application of Cryptographic Relays in collateralized loans on cryptographic cars is explored, highlighting the use of SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT and Taproot.ZmnSCPxj shares a rentable charging station project for electric cars, envisioning the implementation of a rentable Cryptographic Relay device with support for MuSig, Timelocks, and Delegated operators. The article explains the rental contract process using fresh keypairs, rent-transfer commands, and rental-end commands to transfer ownership between parties. Bitcoin-side payments via Lightning-with-PTLC are also discussed, requiring Taproot but not SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT. The scenarios of early returns or renting in smaller time units are considered.Furthermore, ZmnSCPxj discusses the possibility of renting out smart domiciles that can be locked/unlocked by the owner/operator of a Cryptographic Relay. A deposit is involved, and the construction of a rent-with-deposit contract is similar to the construction of collateralized loans with PTLCs. The article suggests that smart contract languages should have PTLCs and partial signatures as primitives and be written in a compositional/declarative style.In summary, Cryptographic Relays are electrical components that enable control of electrical circuits using public keys. They can be used in Succinct Atomic Swaps and have applications in various scenarios such as verifying ownership, collateralized loans, and rental contracts. The notion of time plays a crucial role in implementing these concepts, and the use of block header hashes allows for compatibility with Lightning and PTLCs. However, it is important to emphasize that engaging in illegal activities, such as stealing and hotwiring cars, should be avoided, and ethical practices should be followed at all times.</summary>
