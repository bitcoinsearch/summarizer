    <summary>During a discussion about the OP_ADD function in Bitcoin, it has come to light that the function has a limitation of only allowing 4-byte operands. Any changes to this limitation would require either a hard blockchain split or an entire network upgrade. In response to this limitation, user Ben Reeves has submitted a draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).This proposed BIP serves as an alternative to BIP 16, also known as &quot;/P2SH/&quot;. Reeves has named his draft &quot;BIP M of 2 DRAFT&quot;, and it is available for review on the Bitcoin Wiki page. In order to gather feedback and comments from the community, Reeves has requested input on his proposed BIP.By exploring this alternative proposal, users have the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and insights regarding the current limitations of the OP_ADD function in Bitcoin. It is important to note that any potential changes to address this limitation would necessitate careful consideration due to the impact they would have on the blockchain and the need for a possible hard fork or network-wide upgrade.Therefore, interested parties are encouraged to examine the details of Reeves' draft BIP on the Bitcoin Wiki page and provide their valuable feedback and comments. This collaborative effort will help shape the future development and improvement of Bitcoin's functionality.</summary>
