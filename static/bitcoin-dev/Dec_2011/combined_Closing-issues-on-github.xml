    <summary>In a recent discussion, it has been suggested that someone could potentially take on the task of backporting to wx 2.8 for wxBitcoin. However, it is important to note that this issue is no longer considered a priority for the main project. The term &quot;main project&quot; refers specifically to the issue list of the bitcoin/bitcoin project on Github, which solely focuses on that particular project and not its forks.The argument presented in the discussion emphasizes the need to avoid a centralized mindset, as there are various forks of the project, including bitcoind, wxBitcoin, Bitcoin-Qt, and MultiBit, each with their own separate issue lists. It is crucial to understand that despite the content of this message, it does not constitute an official document that determines the future direction of bitcoin.A significant point of reference in this discussion is an email exchange from 2011 involving John Smith. In this exchange, Smith discussed the closure of certain issues related to Wx UI problems. He clearly stated that they no longer provide support for the old UI and proposed that someone should consider taking up the maintenance of wxBitcoin, potentially after backporting to wx 2.8. However, Smith himself admitted that he had no personal interest in this task as he preferred Qt.Furthermore, Smith highlighted the importance of avoiding a centralized mindset and emphasized that several non-functional clients should be treated equally. He also noted that while some of the older issues remain relevant, having over 150 open issues is not ideal. Smith expressed curiosity about how other open source projects handle similar situations without causing conflicts among contributors. As a closing remark, he mentioned a recent example where KDE closed a bug he reported in 2002, citing that the component with the bug had not been part of KDE since 2008.Over the weekend, the main project took action by closing old GitHub issues that were either no longer reproducible or did not require further input from the original submitter. Among these closures were issues specifically related to Wx UI problems, such as bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/425, since the old UI is no longer supported. The question was raised regarding whether anyone wanted to maintain the old UI, but it was ultimately deemed unnecessary and not a priority for the main project.Although there are still some older issues that remain relevant, the fact that there were over 150 open issues was seen as less than ideal. This prompted the writer of the discussion to ponder how other open source projects handle similar situations without causing conflicts among contributors.</summary>
