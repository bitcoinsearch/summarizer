    <summary>During the email conversation, Francis GASCHET reported a problem they encountered while executing genuid.sh after compiling Bitcoin core on Debian 7. The error message displayed was "too many arguments". Francis shared their solution to fix this issue by making modifications to the genbuild.sh file. Specifically, they made changes to the if condition where the command "$(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2&gt;/dev/null)" = "true" was executed. The modification involved adding double quotes around "$(git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2&gt;/dev/null)" = "true". This adjustment successfully resolved the problem, allowing genuid.sh to execute without any issues.Wladimir, in response to Francis' solution, acknowledged it and informed him that there is an existing issue for this problem on Github. However, Wladimir mentioned that Rebroad's solution presented a new error. As a result, he planned to merge Francis' patch instead. With this information, it can be concluded that Francis' solution effectively addressed the issue with executing genuid.sh after compiling Bitcoin core on Debian 7.</summary>
