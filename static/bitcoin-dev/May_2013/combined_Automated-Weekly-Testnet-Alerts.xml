    <summary>Starting next Thursday on the testnet, developers will be able to access automated weekly alerts to test their alert-handling code. These alerts will contain a message stating that it is a test alert, along with the timestamp of the initial broadcast. They will expire between 2 to 4 hours and will have varying priority levels. The announcement for these alerts will be made at 13:00 UTC, which is currently 9am EST.The purpose of this initiative is to provide developers with a practical way to test their alert-handling code. By receiving these weekly alerts, developers can identify any issues or bugs in their systems and make necessary improvements. It is important to note that these alerts are not actual emergencies but are solely for testing purposes.This new feature will be advantageous for developers who want to ensure that their alert-handling code is working efficiently and effectively. It offers them a platform to test and enhance their systems' capabilities. By participating in these weekly tests, developers can contribute to the overall security and reliability of the system.In addition to the information about the alerts, the email also includes a link to download a free book called &quot;Graph Databases.&quot; This book is written by three renowned leaders in the field and provides valuable insights into graph databases.Overall, this email serves as an announcement to the Bitcoin-development mailing list, informing developers of the upcoming opportunity to test their alert-handling code using automated weekly alerts. It emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and improvement to ensure the system's integrity and reliability.</summary>
