    <summary>Melvin Carvalho has expressed interest in adding Bitcoin's Koblitz curve to the proposed native crypto browser support, which is set to be implemented next year. The current Web Crypto API includes three NIST recommended curves: P-256, P-384, and P-521. In order to gather more information on this matter, Melvin reached out to the chair of the crypto group, who advised him to email public-webcrypto-comments at w3.org and specify his use-cases.The main objective of the proposed native crypto browser support is to expose existing crypto code rather than requiring browser vendors to develop new code. However, there is an unresolved issue regarding the maintenance of an &quot;experimental&quot; registry for identifiers of new curves not included in the core specification. The chair of the crypto group suggested that if browsers do not currently support the Koblitz curve, they may consider supporting it in the future due to Bitcoin's growing popularity.To further explore this topic, Melvin requested individuals with a use case for ecdsa (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) in the browser to contact him or contribute to the public discussion list. The proposed native crypto browser support currently includes the three aforementioned NIST curves, but there are arguments for including the Koblitz curve used by Bitcoin. More details about the Koblitz curve can be found on the Bitcointalk forum.Overall, the discussion revolves around the inclusion of Bitcoin's Koblitz curve in the upcoming native crypto browser support, with Melvin Carvalho actively seeking input from relevant parties.</summary>
