    <summary>In an email exchange between Gregory Maxwell and Will Bickford, Bickford expressed concern about having to go through 280,000 lines of code. However, Maxwell clarified that only about 36kloc of that code was relevant, with the remaining 170kloc consisting of machine-generated code with translation strings. Maxwell recommended skimming through the smaller portion of the code, emphasizing that it was much more manageable than initially thought. The email thread was titled &quot;In Google We Trust&quot;.Bickford, who is new to Bitcoin development, plans to share regular status updates on his blog at http://hewo.xedoloh.com/bitcoin-dev/ for others who are also starting out in Bitcoin development. Based on a sampling of code from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/key.cpp, Bickford estimated that reading the entire code base would require approximately 110 hours of his time. He asked if there was a map of the most important areas to study for new developers and automated test writers, as he believed that investing that much time into reading the code would enable him to conduct extensive testing. Bickford expressed his commitment to learning as much as he can about Bitcoin development and sharing his progress with others.</summary>
