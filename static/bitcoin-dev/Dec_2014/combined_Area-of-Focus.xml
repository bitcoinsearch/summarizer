    <summary>Jeff Garzik recommended that Will take a look at how the current tests are built in src/test, including RPC, REST, P2P, internal unit tests, and more. He suggested operating automated tests at the Qt level and joining #bitcoin-dev IRC to ask questions and read the Bitcoin wiki. The current tests only scratch the surface of what needs to be tested, so there is plenty of room for improvement in this area.There have been discussions regarding DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs because some of the hosts they pick up run Bitcoin Core nodes alongside malware-serving web servers. It is unclear how ISPs are reading the DNS seed's node list and scanning those IPs for malware before ending up blocking the DNS seed. A potential solution may be supporting a subdomain with results XORed with some constant mask to tweak the real IP. It may also be useful to add a TXT/AAAA/whatever record with a signature of the results provided by the DNSseed operator.Will Bickford expressed an interest in contributing to Bitcoin development testing and requested feedback on where he can make the most significant impact. Christian Decker added a safety check to his crawler, hoping to prevent it from being blacklisted. The Bitcoin community is currently discussing ways to address the issue of DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs due to the hosts they pick up, which often run malware or other web servers alongside. Despite the desire to maintain DNS because of its built-in anonymity network, there is a need for a potential solution that will prevent ISP's from blocking these seeds.In summary, Will Bickford is interested in contributing to Bitcoin core development, particularly in the area of testing. There are discussions about DNS seeds being blocked by ISPs due to the presence of malware-serving web servers alongside Bitcoin Core nodes. Potential solutions include supporting subdomains and adding signatures to DNS records. The Bitcoin community is actively working on addressing this issue to ensure the smooth functioning of the network.</summary>
