    <summary>A new initiative has been launched to gather the opinions of Bitcoin developers on various covenant proposals by creating a draft for a Bitcoin wiki page. This initiative mirrors the approach taken with the SegWit support page, aiming to facilitate consensus building for upcoming soft forks. The wiki page, which can be accessed at [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support), currently lists a selection of opcodes deemed relevant but is open for further contributions. Developers are encouraged to add more opcodes and share their insights by adding their GitHub usernames alongside their opinions.

The importance of developer input is highlighted by the inclusion of a link to a presentation that outlines the rationale behind supporting OP_CTV (OP_CheckTemplateVerify). This proposal, detailed at [Rationale for OP_CTV](https://notes.dunst.be/slide//2/slide/view/Ekky-cAegV9dSOaNOjH9TStNOmAnrhDDc9hxHlmRs5M/embed/present/), is particularly noted for its potential to enhance pools with covenants, thereby improving implementations of joinstr, such as coinjoin. The sender of this message, identifying themselves humorously as "floppy disk guy," emphasizes the significance of these discussions in simplifying the process towards the next soft fork and underscores the collective effort required to refine and agree upon the most beneficial proposals.</summary>
