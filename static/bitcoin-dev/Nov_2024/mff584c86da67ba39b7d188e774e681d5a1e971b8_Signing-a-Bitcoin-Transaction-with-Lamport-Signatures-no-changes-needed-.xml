    <summary>The discussion raises concerns regarding the practicality of transforming a concept into a covenant within the realm of blockchain technology, particularly emphasizing the limitations and potential of specific opcodes like OP_SIZE. The skepticism lies in the direct relationship between the extracted bits using OP_SIZE and their connection to the sighash through what is described as a random function. This observation underlines the complexities involved in leveraging existing opcodes for creating more sophisticated and enforceable contracts or covenants on the blockchain.

Further exploration into the topic suggests a theoretical possibility of circumventing these limitations by utilizing an unlimited set of opcodes. The argument proposes that with such a comprehensive toolkit, it might be feasible to construct small scripts capable of introspecting the entire blockchain. These scripts, potentially incorporating Simplified Payment Verification (SPV), could enforce certain rules or conditions without relying on the previously mentioned OP_SIZE or OP_CAT opcodes. This approach hints at a significant shift towards more advanced and flexible scripting capabilities within blockchain systems.

Moreover, the conversation introduces the idea of integrating snarks (succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge) into these small scripts. By doing so, the size of the script remains large yet constant, irrespective of the blockchain's size. This proposition not only addresses the initial concern regarding the scalability and efficiency of using opcodes for covenant creation but also opens up new avenues for enhancing privacy and security through advanced cryptographic techniques.</summary>
