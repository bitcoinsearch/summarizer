    <summary>The discussion revolves around the availability of ARM binaries for major operating systems, with a specific focus on the lack thereof for Windows. It is noted that while Linux and presumably Apple Silicon (which uses ARM architecture) have support for ARM binaries, Windows does not appear to have this support readily available. The inquiry delves into how one might go about compiling Windows applications using the ARM toolchain, questioning whether existing methods offer Arm64 support.

Further exploration within the message points to the Windows build guide as a source of information, hinting that Visual Studio could potentially support ARM compilation. However, a challenge is identified in the form of possible x86-specific assembly functions within the codebase, which may complicate the process of building for ARM architecture. This highlights a technical barrier that needs addressing for developers looking to support ARM on Windows platforms.

The message encapsulates a broader conversation about cross-platform compatibility and development efficiency, underscoring the need for comprehensive toolchain support across all architectures and operating systems. It suggests a growing interest and demand for ARM support within the Windows development community, reflecting the ongoing shift towards more versatile and power-efficient computing solutions provided by ARM technology.</summary>
