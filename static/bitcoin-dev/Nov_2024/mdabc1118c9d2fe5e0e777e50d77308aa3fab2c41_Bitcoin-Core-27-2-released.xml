    <summary>The release of Bitcoin Core version 27.2 has been announced, available for download from [Bitcoin Core's official website](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-27.2/) or through BitTorrent with the provided magnet link. This update encompasses several bug fixes, performance enhancements, and updated translations. Users are encouraged to report any bugs via the project's GitHub issue tracker.

For those looking to upgrade from an older version of Bitcoin Core, it is advised to first shut down the existing application completely before initiating the upgrade process. Detailed instructions are provided for users across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Notably, upgrading from a version that has reached its end of life (EOL) may require additional time if a data directory migration is necessary. Furthermore, older wallet versions remain supported under this new release.

Compatibility for Bitcoin Core extends across several operating systems, having been extensively tested on Linux Kernel versions 3.17 and above, macOS 11.0 and above, as well as Windows 7 and onwards. While it should operate on other Unix-like systems, these environments receive less frequent testing, and using Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems is not recommended.

Significant changes in version 27.2 include improvements and fixes across various components such as P2P connections, initialization processes, RPC calls, PSBT functionality, testing frameworks, documentation, and build systems. Noteworthy adjustments include fixing a race condition in self-connect detection within the P2P environment, changing the shutdown order of load block thread and scheduler during initialization, and resolving issues related to FillPSBT calls erroneously returning complete=true status.

This release also addresses compatibility issues with GCC 15 and updates for building with miniupnpc 2.2.8. Contributions to this release come from a range of developers, highlighting the collaborative effort involved in its development. The announcement concludes by expressing gratitude towards all contributors and translators who played a role in this release, emphasizing the community-driven nature of Bitcoin Core's development.</summary>
