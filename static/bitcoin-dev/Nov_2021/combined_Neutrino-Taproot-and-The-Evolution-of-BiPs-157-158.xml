    <summary>Last week, there was a problem with the Neutrino nodes on the testnet. This issue was caused by a faulty heuristic in the client code that tried to verify the contents of a filter more thoroughly. However, it is important to note that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with BIP 157/158 in relation to taproot.The good news is that the problematic heuristic has been removed, and it will be included in lnd 0.14. This update has also been tagged with neutrino 0.13. To ensure a smooth transition for neutrino clients during the Taproot upgrade on the mainnet, users have the option to upgrade to version 0.14 or apply a small patch.In addition to addressing the recent issue, progress is being made towards adding more taproot-specific functionality. Some of the items being considered include reviving old projects to incorporate a micropayment-for-data layer, creating new segwit-only filters with re-parameterized fp rates, and developing filters that include witness data for matching on internal/external keys, the control block, merkle root, annex, etc.Furthermore, efforts are being made to introduce a new protocol extension to btcd, along with a corresponding BIP, which would allow nodes to fetch block undo data in order to fully verify fetched filters or reconcile conflicting filters. There is also ongoing work on new filters that span across multiple blocks, as well as progress towards a proposal that allows filters to be committed either as a soft-fork or a "velvet fork," where miners can optionally commit to the past filter header chain.Overall, steps are being taken to address the issues encountered with the Neutrino client code and to enhance taproot-specific functionality. Users can upgrade to the latest version or apply a patch to ensure a smooth transition during the Taproot upgrade on the mainnet.</summary>
