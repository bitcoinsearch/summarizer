    <summary>The concept of Post-Quantum cross-input signature aggregation (CISA) in Bitcoin, although not traditional signature aggregation, offers similar benefits without being tied to a specific signature scheme. Cross-input signature aggregation has been discussed within the Bitcoin community, with related research such as MuSig2, FROST, and ROAST implemented in wallets, yet without a consensus change in Bitcoin to enable CISA. The space savings from full aggregation are shown to be around 7.1% vByte savings, according to research hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/cross-input-aggregation/blob/master/savings.org). This is particularly relevant for post-quantum signatures where sizes significantly exceed those of current schemes, potentially occupying over 90% of transaction bytes even after segwit discounts.
The proposed method involves a transaction input proving linkage to another input within the same transaction through an innovative use of an opcode, dubbed OP_CIV or OP_CHECKINPUTVERIFY, which allows one input to use the signature of another by referencing it, thereby reducing the number of signatures required in a transaction. This could have widespread implications for wallet design, especially in terms of address generation and backup recovery. By adding branches in the taproot tree for each UTXO in the wallet and incorporating blinding data to prevent attackers from guessing UTXO linkages, the need for multiple signatures per transaction could be reduced. However, this system introduces complications for deterministic wallets, as recovering which pubkeys point to which UTXOs becomes challenging without generating additional entropy. Solutions include limiting the number of OP_CIV scripts or including scripts for spent TXOs to aid in recovery efforts.
The concern about replay attacks appears manageable since OP_CIV points to outpoints rather than addresses or keys, mitigated by using SIGHASH_ALL for the signing input. Despite potential applications in contracts and transaction size reduction for post-quantum scenarios, the practical implementation of committing script pubkeys to previous outputs could be limited, especially for deterministic wallets commonly used today. An alternative suggestion involves aggregating inputs controlled by the same owner without creating statefulness by committing a taptree to a deterministic set of pubkeys, allowing a single signature to authorize transactions from commonly-owned inputs. This approach could simplify address generation and backup processes but may have adverse effects on UTXO privacy due to stronger, provable common-owner heuristics on-chain.
In summary, while the idea presents innovative solutions to the challenges of implementing cross-input signature aggregation in a post-quantum scenario, it also raises questions regarding its practicality, especially concerning wallet infrastructure and privacy implications. The ongoing dialogue among developers highlights the dynamic nature of blockchain technology's evolution and the complexities involved in balancing scalability, security, and user experience in the face of advancing cryptographic challenges.</summary>
