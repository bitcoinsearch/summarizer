    <summary>In March 2025, BIP 3 was advanced to a "Proposed" status following the completion of planned work in February. Since its advancement, it has undergone several minor adjustments for improvement. An active pull request on GitHub ([pull request #1820](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1820)) has been maintained since April, aimed at activating BIP 3. This proposal has garnered significant attention, evidenced by over 600 comments on the pull request and extensive discussions across various threads on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. The support for activating BIP 3 is evident, with a substantial number of individuals endorsing the proposal by leaving an ACK on the pull request.

The proponent of BIP 3 has formally suggested adopting BIP 3 to supersede BIP 2 in the BIPs Process, noting that BIP 2 lacks a specified procedure for activating Process BIPs. Stakeholders are encouraged to express their support or raise any concerns regarding this proposal within a set timeframe, extending an additional four weeks until December 2, 2025. This period aims to provide ample opportunity for review and discussion among community members, including those who have not previously engaged with the proposal.

Significant modifications to BIP 3 since its progression to a proposed state include the adoption of SPDX License Expressions for the License header, the elimination of the License-Code header in favor of directory-specific licensing terms, and a renaming of the "Created" header to "Assigned." Additionally, refinements to the BIP text have been made to better articulate the purpose of the BIPs repository, encourage authors to validate the viability of their proposals via the mailing list, and clarify the process surrounding the publication, acceptance, and adoption of proposals. It also addresses the closure of Draft BIPs due to lack of progress and stipulates that BIP submissions cannot be generated by AI/LLM technologies. These updates aim to enhance the clarity and functionality of the BIP process.</summary>
