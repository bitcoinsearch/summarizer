    <summary>The Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 3 (BIP 3) has seen significant progress since its initiation, moving from a planned phase to being proposed in March 2025. The proposal has been subject to extensive discussion and refinement over several months, evidenced by the over 600 comments on its GitHub page and multiple discussions within the Bitcoin Development Mailing List. Despite these discussions, there have been no unaddressed objections, indicating a broad consensus on the proposal's current form. A considerable number of individuals have shown their support for BIP 3 by leaving an "ACK" on the pull request, signaling their approval of the changes it introduces.
Murch, the individual responsible for maintaining the pull request for activating BIP 3, has proposed formally adopting it to replace BIP 2 in the BIPs Process. This comes after noticing that BIP 2 lacks a specified procedure for activating Process BIPs, leading to the suggestion that supporters should express their approval directly on the pull request or through the mailing list. Additionally, Murch has extended an invitation for any further concerns or objections to be raised within a set timeframe, offering an additional four weeks for review before considering whether there is rough consensus for merging the activation pull request.
Several minor but noteworthy adjustments to BIP 3 were made during its proposal stage. These include the adoption of SPDX License Expressions for the License header, the removal of the License-Code header in favor of specifying license terms directly in the directory or folder of auxiliary files, and renaming the “Created” header to “Assigned”. Furthermore, clarifications were added to the BIP text to better define the purpose of the BIPs repository, outline the process for establishing the viability of proposals through the mailing list, distinguish between the publication, acceptance, and adoption phases of proposals, address when Draft BIPs can be closed for lack of progress, and state that submissions may not be generated by artificial intelligence or large language models.
The feedback from the community, including explicit endorsements and constructive suggestions, highlights the collaborative effort involved in refining BIP 3. This collective input has been instrumental in addressing potential issues and ensuring the proposal's alignment with the needs and expectations of the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
