    <title>Motion to Activate BIP 3</title>

    <summary>In a recent communication on the Bitcoin Development Mailing List, a correction was made regarding the activation process for Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), specifically Process BIPs. The clarification addressed a previous misconception about the novelty of the activation process introduced by BIP 3. It was acknowledged that BIP 2 already outlined the procedure for activating Process BIPs, contrary to the initial claim that BIP 2 did not specify such a procedure. 

BIP 2 delineates that a Process BIP can transition from Draft to Active status upon achieving rough consensus within the mailing list community. This is contingent upon the proposal being open for discussion for at least one month and not facing any sustained, unaddressed objections. It allows for the dismissal or overriding of objections deemed addressed or obstructive, provided there is a general agreement supported by clear reasoning. 

The correction underscores that the approach previously proposed for activating complies with the established guidelines in BIP 2, eliminating the need for any revision to the activation process. This clarification serves to correct the record and reaffirm the process for moving forward with Process BIPs within the Bitcoin development community.</summary>
