    <summary>The feature request under discussion highlights the necessity for Bitcoin to improve its resilience against major solar events, such as significant solar storms, which could disrupt Earth's electrical and communication infrastructures. These disruptions pose a real threat to the integrity of the Bitcoin network, potentially causing fragmentation into isolated regions that continue mining independently. This scenario could lead to divergent blockchain versions, resulting in deep chain splits and extensive reorganizations once global connectivity is restored. Such outcomes could severely impact users, operators, and service providers associated with Bitcoin.
The proposed enhancements aim at bolstering Bitcoin's robustness without altering its consensus rules. The focus is on two main areas: support for degraded communication and operator guidance. For communication, the proposal suggests enhancing documentation or developing optional tools that would enable Bitcoin operations over compromised communication channels like HF/VHF radio links, mesh networks, or intermittent satellite connections. Although these methods are currently experimental, their formalization and integration could offer valuable support in extreme conditions. Operator guidance involves outlining best practices for managing wallets, mining operations, and node activities when facing high latency or network partitioning, aiming to minimize disruptions during and after reconnection phases.
There's a discussion on whether these initiatives should be pursued within the scope of Bitcoin Core development or handled by external projects. This reflects an understanding of the need for alternative critical communication mechanisms, acknowledging that such infrastructure often falls outside economically viable options and typically relies on governmental support and maintenance. The conversation also touches on the fact that the challenges posed by severe solar phenomena are not unique to Bitcoin, suggesting a broader relevance of the proposed solutions. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of preparing Bitcoin to withstand and recover swiftly from the adverse effects of such phenomena, underscoring a commitment to ensuring the network's long-term resilience and reliability.</summary>
