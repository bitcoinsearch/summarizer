    <summary>The proposal introduces a soft-fork package for Bitcoin, named LNHANCE, consisting of four new opcodes: OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV), OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS), OP_INTERNALKEY (IKEY), and OP_PAIRCOMMIT (PC). These opcodes are designed to enhance the efficiency of LN-Symmetry, a key implementation in the Lightning Network, with detailed documentation available on their respective GitHub pages. The possibility of replacing CTV with TEMPLATEHASH (TH) and PC with CAT is mentioned, acknowledging that these substitutions could potentially offer similar benefits while addressing some concerns related to unintended consequences.

The primary goal of LNHANCE is to provide improvements without enabling fine-grained introspection, state-carrying covenants, bigint operations, or new arithmetic capabilities through lookup tables. The choice of opcodes, particularly avoiding CAT due to its enabling of introspection and other complexities, underscores a cautious approach to evolution, aiming to avoid introducing features that could lead to significant contention within the Bitcoin community.

Questions regarding the adoption and technical aspects of LNHANCE are addressed, highlighting the project's current status and future plans. For instance, the lack of a signet, the decision not to open a PR to core due to past challenges, and the maintenance of an activation client awaiting further review are discussed. The proposed activation mechanism follows a modified BIP-9 protocol with specific parameters outlined in a provided GitHub link.

Criticism of the Lightning Network as fraudulent is briefly touched upon, with the response suggesting a belief in the potential of LNHANCE to improve and scale LN and adjacent Layer 2 solutions. The call for code reviews indicates an ongoing development process, inviting contributions from the community. The mention of anonymous donations for sponsorship suggests a community-driven effort with an openness to support without strings attached.
