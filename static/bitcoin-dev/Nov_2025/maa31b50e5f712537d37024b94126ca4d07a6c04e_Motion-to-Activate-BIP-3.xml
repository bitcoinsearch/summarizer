    <summary>In the realm of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), there has been a notable discussion regarding the handling of contributions perceived as low effort, particularly those generated by large language models (LLMs). A suggestion was put forth to institute a policy whereby such submissions could be dismissed without comprehensive review. This approach would empower BIP editors to employ detection tools for the automatic dismissal of content deemed to fall under this category. The rationale behind this proposal underscores the importance of effort and originality in contributions, paralleling existing standards that assess the quality of submissions.

The implementation of detection tools for automatically closing submissions suspected of being low-effort is not without its challenges, notably the subjective nature of determining what constitutes sufficient effort or quality. However, it was argued that this mechanism would not significantly hinder genuine contributors. In instances where a submission is auto-closed, authors would have the opportunity to demonstrate the earnestness of their efforts through various means, such as providing evidence of public discussions or endorsements from reputable figures within the community.

Furthermore, the concern over copyright infringement with respect to BIPs was addressed. It was posited that in cases where copyright claims are made against a BIP, the most straightforward resolution would be to comply with the takedown notice, thereby avoiding potential legal entanglements. The option to either contest the claim legally or rephrase the content was presented as viable solutions to such issues.

Additionally, the conversation touched upon the broader implications of these policies on both high-effort and low-effort contributions. It was noted that while the emphasis on reducing verbose and potentially superfluous content is pertinent across all types of submissions, the impact is particularly pronounced in the context of high-effort contributions. Strategies such as inquiring into the necessity of lengthy paragraphs and encouraging the practical implementation of BIPs in coding projects were suggested as means to enhance the clarity and utility of proposals. Ultimately, the expectation is that significant and actively used BIPs will undergo refinement and improvement over time, whereas lesser-used BIPs may remain of lower quality, albeit with minimal concern from the community given their limited application.</summary>
