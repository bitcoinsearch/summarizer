    <title>Motion to Activate BIP 3</title>

    <summary>In an effort to streamline the review process and enhance the quality of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), specific guidelines have been introduced regarding the use of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in the creation of BIP drafts. These guidelines emphasize the necessity for authors to declare any employment of AI/LLMs at the outset, specifically in the PR description, without prompting. This proactive disclosure aims to facilitate a more efficient review process by preemptively addressing potential issues related to the generated content's quality and originality. The rules mandate that no content within BIP drafts should be generated by AI/LLMs, underscoring concerns regarding the ease of generating content that may not meet the standards required for such technical documents.

The introduction of these guidelines has sparked a debate within the community, particularly concerning their stringency and practical implications. Questions arise about the extent of disclosure required, especially in scenarios where AI might play a minor or indirect role in the drafting process. For instance, the ambiguity surrounding whether the use of AI for unrelated tasks, such as summarizing communications or making decisions not directly included in the BIP, needs to be disclosed. Furthermore, there's confusion over when and how this disclosure should be made, illustrating a need for clearer guidelines.

Additionally, the requirement that a BIP must be an "original work of its authors" has introduced further complexity. This stipulation leads to inquiries about the permissibility of proposing ideas inspired by external sources, such as blog posts or academic research. Such concerns reflect broader uncertainties about the interpretation and enforcement of the new guidelines.

Despite these controversies, the update to include AI-specific rules was integrated into the BIP3 framework relatively late in the revision process, with minimal discussion—a move that has led to calls for reassessment. Some community members suggest reverting the AI-related additions until a consensus can be reached or possibly introducing these provisions in a separate BIP. This approach aims to prevent the ongoing debates from stalling the activation of BIP3, allowing for future revisions to address the nuanced challenges posed by AI and LLMs in the development of BIPs more comprehensively. The links shared in the communication provide additional context and viewpoints on the matter, highlighting the diversity of opinions within the community regarding the integration of AI technologies in the BIP drafting process.</summary>
