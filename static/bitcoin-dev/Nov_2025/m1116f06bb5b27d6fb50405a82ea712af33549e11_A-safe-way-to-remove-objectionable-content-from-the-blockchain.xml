    <summary>In a detailed discussion on the utilization of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for improving blockchain technologies, particularly with an emphasis on Inter-Blockchain Data (IBD) issues, an interesting perspective was shared regarding the prioritization of succinctness over the zero-knowledge aspect in cryptographic protocols. The discourse suggests considering SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) rather than Zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), highlighting that the absence of a zero-knowledge requirement could facilitate protocols where witness data does not need to be kept secret. This approach potentially simplifies the protocol design without compromising on its core functionalities.

Furthermore, the conversation evolves to address concerns regarding data and bandwidth efficiency in these cryptographic protocols. It’s underscored that any protocol demanding excessive data or bandwidth is likely less competitive than those which manage to minimize these requirements. This leads into an acknowledgment of the necessity for "data carrying" within the state of a blockchain, contrasting with the handling of data in the blockchain's history. This insight aligns with ongoing discussions in the field, including debates on embedding data within transactions, as evidenced by various internet forums and technical discussions.

Additionally, there's a critical examination of Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) and their operational necessities within blockchain frameworks. Contrary to some opinions that HTLCs should require proof of publication, the argument is made that what is actually needed is the publication itself. This point of view distinguishes between the need for proof of the capability to publish at contract setup—deemed as "proof of future publication"—and the act of publication, which is essential for ensuring that a party wronged by a channel can access the preimage. This distinction underscores a broader discussion on the nature of data publication and verification within blockchain operations, paralleling the functionality of models like OpenTimestamps, which prioritize proof of publication.

This exchange encapsulates a nuanced understanding of advanced cryptographic techniques and their application in blockchain technology, advocating for a balance between efficiency and functionality in the development of blockchain protocols. The focus shifts from theoretical preferences towards practical implications, emphasizing the importance of designing systems that are both efficient and capable of supporting the desired security and privacy features.</summary>
