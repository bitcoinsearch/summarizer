    <summary>The draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal submitted for discussion aims at the standardization of on-chain identity publication. It introduces a specification that includes canonical CBOR payloads and employs Poseidon-based `nullifier_hash` domain separation with identifiers `v0iden` and `v0corp`. Additionally, it proposes the use of an optional Ed25519 signature wrapper to enhance security measures. The proposal's details, including text and implementation notes, are accessible through a provided link to a PR on GitHub ([view the PR here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/2038)). The submission calls for community feedback, particularly focusing on aspects such as interoperability, the process of canonicalization via deterministic CBOR, and overall security considerations. This outreach is part of an effort to engage with the wider Bitcoin development community by sharing the proposal through the Bitcoin Development Mailing List.</summary>
