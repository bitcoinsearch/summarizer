    <summary>The discussion revolves around the apprehension regarding the potential stigma associated with disclosing AI assistance in research, particularly within the context of Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The core concern highlighted is the ambiguity surrounding the necessity and timing for adding an "AI label" to BIPs when AI has been utilized in the research process. This uncertainty reflects a broader dilemma faced by researchers about the implications of openly acknowledging AI's role in their work, amidst fears that such disclosures could be perceived negatively rather than as a mark of transparency or innovation.</summary>
