    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a developer at Bitcoin Core, has recently announced that the special meaning of the `setgenerate` RPC call for -regtest will be deprecated and replaced with a separate RPC call called `generate`. This decision comes as part of an effort by Bitcoin Core developers to make improvements and updates to the software.The change is not expected to affect any production functionality and the developers are known for being conservative when it comes to altering RPC behavior. However, they are open to understanding if there are any software or users who require compatibility with the old behavior before proceeding with the switch.In light of this announcement, the bitcoin.org developer documentation will need to be revised and updated to reflect the upcoming change. This is important to ensure that users and developers have accurate and up-to-date information about the RPC calls and their functionalities.Sean, a Java RPC client and Groovy/Spock functional tests writer, supports the idea of introducing a separate `generate` or `generateblocks` call. However, he points out that in order to maintain compatibility with both the current stable and unstable versions of Bitcoin Core, as well as the Omni Core fork, additional code will need to be written to check the RPC server version.Overall, the deprecation of the `setgenerate` RPC call's special meaning for -regtest and its replacement with a separate RPC call `generate` marks a significant change in the Bitcoin Core software. Developers are seeking feedback from users and software providers to ensure a smooth transition while keeping compatibility in mind. The bitcoin.org developer documentation will be updated accordingly to reflect these changes and provide accurate guidance to the community.</summary>
