    <summary>In a discussion about running full nodes on desktop systems, Patrick Shirkey expressed concerns about the viability of running a full node on a system used for other purposes. He believes that bitcoin-qt consumes a lot of CPU/GPU resources, which can be problematic for users who need to share their system resources between normal desktop workload and running a full node. However, Sean challenged this statement by stating that when running a full node in non-mining mode, the CPU load is fairly light and the GPU is not used at all. Sean also mentioned that Bitcoin is tolerant of nodes entering and leaving the network at will, and even part-time nodes help improve the network's quality.Regarding the move to a 2MB hard fork, every node will need to upgrade. Planning the rollout effect of the hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is difficult, and relying solely on press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes is not viable. Sean emphasized the importance of learning from past experiences and not making hard forks on a whim.Running Bitcoin-qt on a spinning hard disk can cause system responsiveness issues and disrupt the user experience. However, moving the Bitcoin data to an SSD significantly improves the user experience. After initial synchronization, Bitcoin-qt only uses a small amount of CPU to verify new blocks and transactions. Running Bitcoin-qt continuously is less painful than running it occasionally. To run a full node on a small desktop machine, it is recommended to move the Bitcoin data off spinning media onto an SSD, have plenty of RAM, and leave bitcoin-qt running all the time.The number of full nodes worldwide is unknown because not all nodes have open ports that can be probed. While there are around 5,500 full nodes with open ports, there are likely several thousand more nodes with closed ports that cannot be measured. Full nodes play a crucial role in ensuring that all of Bitcoin's rules are being followed, making it trustless and secure. It is recommended to run a full node as a wallet for increased security and privacy. Running a full node as a wallet has become easier with improved user experience and efficiency.The rollout of the 2MB hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is a complex process that cannot rely solely on press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes. The Pulse Audio debacle during the mid-2000s serves as a lesson in this regard. However, enabling users to move their wallets to the new blockchain at their leisure does not cause instant degradation in the ecosystem. Bitcoin &quot;brand&quot; loyalty ensures that users who want to explore the economic potential of the 2MB blocksize can keep their existing funds safe while testing the waters with the new blocksize. Bitcoin remains the only game in town when it comes to scale and a proven history of financial return. As the new blockchain gains momentum, the old one will eventually become obsolete but may also serve as a useful and profitable alternative.A post by Chris Belcher on the bitcoin-dev mailing list debunks some myths about full nodes. The misconception that there are only around 5,500 full nodes worldwide stems from websites that measure open ports for probing. However, not all nodes have open ports, so the actual number is likely much higher. While open-port nodes are useful for measuring bandwidth capacity, closed-port nodes are equally important for trust, security, and privacy. Running a full node as a wallet is in an individual bitcoin user's rational self-interest because it ensures that none of Bitcoin's rules have been broken and increases security against possible attacks. Full node wallets are also the most private way to use Bitcoin, as no other parties learn which Bitcoin addresses belong to the user. To enjoy the benefits of running a full node, users should use it as their wallet on hardware they control. Using cloud servers is not recommended due to concerns about trust, security, and privacy. The user experience of full node software has significantly improved since 2012, and there are several ways to run a full node as a wallet, such as using bitcoin-qt, wallet software backed by a full node, or a lightweight wallet that only connects to the user's full node.</summary>
