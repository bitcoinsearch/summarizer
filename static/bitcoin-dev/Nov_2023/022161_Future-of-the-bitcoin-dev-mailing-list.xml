    <summary>Running a personal mail server can be a feasible solution that may not be as daunting as some believe, especially in the context of managing a mailing list. Concerns about spam are primarily relevant when imap/pop3 access is permitted, which typically would not be the case for a mailing list server. One viable option presented is using the infrastructure provided by https://lists.freebsd.org, a service that could be leveraged to facilitate the mailing list needs. If this approach does not materialize, there is a willingness expressed to establish a similar setup for a community-run project, demonstrating a proactive stance towards ensuring the availability of a robust mailing system for group communication.</summary>
