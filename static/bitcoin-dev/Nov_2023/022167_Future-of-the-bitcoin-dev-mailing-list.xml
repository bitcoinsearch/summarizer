    <summary>Antoine expresses appreciation for the efforts of the bitcoin-dev mailing list moderation team over the years. He highlights the importance of finding a communication platform that minimizes the risk of moderators and infrastructure maintainers being coerced through legal pressures, like subpoenas and gag orders. Currently, he is unaware of any such platform or protocols that meet this criterion. Nostr is mentioned as a promising candidate but is perceived to require significant development, estimated at five years, before it can be considered robust. In the interim, Antoine plans to be more active on the Delving Bitcoin forum, which he views as a temporary measure rather than a permanent solution. He suggests considering hosting platforms utilized by kernels or other longstanding open-source project mailing lists as potentially viable options for future communication needs.</summary>
