    <summary>In the email, Antoine discusses the issues related to lightning and other second time-sensitive layers being hit by safety issues when the blocks are full. He mentions that this issue is described in a paper under the "forced expiration spam" issues arising within an environment with high block space demand. He also mentions that there are variants of these issues with the "flood &amp; loot" style scenarios.

Antoine points out a new problem with the novel replacement issues which lies in the fact that the counterparty channel might always defer the confirmation of honest on-chain spend, in a way that is compatible with miners' incentives. He explains that while this ability has been commonized by the wide deployment of bip-125-style RBF over network mempools, it has always been available to any party reaching out directly to miners out-of-band with consensus-valid transactions.

Antoine believes that in a world where miners are pseudonymous, miners motivated by maximizing their satoshi-denominated income is a reasonable assumption. He also agrees with the recipient (John) that as an ecosystem beyond core to fix sustainably pinning and replacement problems, they are stuck with a serious safety issue.

Antoine suggests several options to address this issue:

1. Revert to a static world with no replacement-by-fee mechanism as a widely deployed network policy. In a competitive mining world, one can always reach out to miners with out-of-band higher fee packages than available in their local mempool.

2. Design, implement, and deploy policies to better capture transaction-issuer intent on how future spend candidates are allowed (or not) to replace the current in-mempool transaction. However, Antoine points out that with lightning and other second time-sensitive layers, there is no "single" transaction-issuer intent, as there may be multiple intents depending on the counterparties involved.

3. Remove all policy and let the network of nodes and the economic ecosystem evolve on its own. Antoine notes that many mempool policies in place are actually anti-DoS measures, but they also contribute to the issues of pinning.

4. Do nothing and let a fragmented mempool environment exist, where large lightning and bitcoin businesses have out-of-band relationships with miners and pools to support their packages, along with some service-level safety agreements. Antoine mentions that this option was considered by the lightning community years ago as a way to solve pinning issues at the commitment and second-state level, but it was dismissed due to concerns about centralization.

5. Design and implement some magical consensus-change or alter the processing requirements (bandwidth, CPU perf, I/O disk) of full-nodes on the peer-to-peer network to align incentives between miners and lightning and time-sensitive second-layers. Antoine suggests that this option aligns with the trade-offs discussed in the "reverse locktime" new bitcoin script opcode idea or replacement cache at the mempool-level in core.

Antoine concludes the email by signing off as Best, Antoine.</summary>
