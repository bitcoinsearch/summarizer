    <summary>The recent critique on the nostr protocol highlights several significant issues that question its viability and design. The primary concern is the reliance on single-key cryptography, which has led to numerous instances of key compromises. Such security lapses are particularly troubling in bitcoin-dev circles, as they could lead to the publication of fake messages with potential market-moving consequences.

Another critical flaw in the nostr protocol is its inability to mirror relays effectively. This shortcoming stems from the disregard for lessons learned from blockchain technology. Without reliable mirroring, it becomes impossible to confirm the completeness of message sets from specific individuals or about particular topics.

Furthermore, the nostr protocol's design is pointed out to be highly centralized, contrary to its intended decentralized nature. The current operation depends heavily on a limited number of relays. These central points of failure cannot be easily substituted if they are compromised or shut down, presenting a substantial risk to the network's integrity and reliability.
