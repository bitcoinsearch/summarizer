    <summary>Joe has introduced an innovative mnemonic generation scheme designed to enhance user experience by providing a simple and memorable method for creating mnemonics. This personalized system allows users to customize their own sentence in any language, eliminating the constraints of linguistic barriers. The new scheme builds upon the BIP-39 proposals, offering a more accessible and efficient way for users to retrieve their mnemonics without the fear of forgetting them or the need to write them down.

The core functionality of this approach lies in the utilization of the SHA-256 algorithm. When a user defines a sentence, the algorithm processes it to generate a unique entropy. Subsequently, this entropy is used to derive the corresponding mnemonic phrase. One of the critical features of Joe's system is its full compatibility with the existing BIP-39 standards, ensuring that users can integrate this new method with current security protocols seamlessly.

For those interested in exploring this mnemonic generation system further, Joe provides a reference implementation available at https://github.com/zhouxiaofeng-zxf/nico. This resource serves as a practical example of how the scheme operates and can be used as a starting point for users and developers alike. Joe's contact information is provided for additional inquiries or support related to his mnemonic generation approach.</summary>
