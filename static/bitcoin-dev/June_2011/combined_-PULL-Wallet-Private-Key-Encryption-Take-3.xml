    <summary>Matt Corallo has announced that Wallet Encryption is now available in a pull-able state after previous discussions and progress made. Interested parties can review the changes on the GitHub repository and provide final comments or acknowledgments. The pull request, numbered 352, shows that the Bitcoin codebase has been rebased onto a wallet class. Matt is eager to receive feedback on this development, even though he jokingly predicts some criticism with the phrase &quot;wtf is this crap.&quot; Unfortunately, the context does not provide any additional information about the reasons behind the rebasing or the potential implications for the Bitcoin network.</summary>
