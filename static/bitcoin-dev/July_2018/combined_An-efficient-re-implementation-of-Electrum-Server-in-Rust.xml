    <summary>A new project developed by Roman Zeyde allows users to run their own Electrum server with minimal hardware resources, enabling them to keep track of their balances and transaction history in real-time. By running the server on the user's machine, there is no need for the wallet to communicate with external Electrum servers, ensuring the privacy of the user's addresses and balances. The project supports the latest Electrum protocol and indexes the entire Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for fast queries for any given user wallet. The project boasts several features that make it efficient and user-friendly. It maintains an index of transaction inputs and outputs, enabling fast balance queries. It also offers a fast synchronization of the Bitcoin blockchain on modest hardware, low CPU and memory usage, as well as an efficient mempool tracker for better fee estimation. It does not require the `-txindex` option for the Bitcoin node and uses a single RocksDB database for improved consistency and crash recovery.The code and usage instructions for the project can be found on GitHub, where users can also find links to similar projects such as ElectrumX, Electrum Personal Server, and bitcoincore-indexd. The project encourages pull requests, suggestions, and questions from the community, indicating a commitment to ongoing development and improvement.Overall, this project provides a valuable solution for individuals seeking to maintain their privacy while monitoring their Bitcoin transactions.</summary>
