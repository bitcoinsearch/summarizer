    <summary>Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core developer, has introduced a new construction called &quot;g'root&quot; to address the issue of recursive-taproot-without-revealing-intermediary-scripts. This structure combines the concepts of Pedersen Commitments and taproot, resulting in an equation that combines private keys, hashes of additional conditions, and alternative spending methods.The g'root construction eliminates the distinction between pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-script constructions, providing an easy way to create a softfork-safe cross-input aggregation system. It also ensures that any future cross-input signature aggregation system only applies to companion keys that are not susceptible to potential changes in the scripting language.Wuille suggests deploying schnorr/taproot/mast initially, followed by the addition of graftroot/aggregation. Finally, the deployment of generalised taproot alongside graftroot/aggregation is recommended.In addition to this proposal, there is another suggestion for recursive taproot that utilizes Pedersen Commitments. By combining the taproot structure with a second generator in the curve, it becomes possible to create a pubkey point that can be spent either through direct signing or by revealing additional conditions.To maintain secrecy, the proposal allows users to hide whether there are any lower layers until the merkle-tree of scripts is reached. Furthermore, it enables the non-disclosure of conditions corresponding to any keys other than the one being spent with.This proposal is as space-efficient as basic taproot and potentially more efficient than using a merkle tree with taproot when there are three spending paths.To summarize, Pieter Wuille's &quot;g'root&quot; construction and the proposal for recursive taproot with Pedersen Commitments aim to enhance the functionality and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions. These proposals suggest deploying different components such as schnorr/taproot/mast and graftroot/aggregation in a phased manner to ensure a smooth transition.</summary>
