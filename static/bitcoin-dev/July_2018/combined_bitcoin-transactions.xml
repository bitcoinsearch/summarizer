    <summary>The email thread between Aymeric Vitte and Marcel Jamin discusses the issue of online services that ask for private keys and seeds in exchange for &quot;free&quot; coins. Jamin strongly advises against publishing a service that requires users to provide their private keys, as it poses a significant security risk if the server gets compromised. He also argues that moving coins by oneself is not the correct approach if the server is involved. In response, Vitte warns that people cannot resist the temptation of obtaining &quot;free&quot; coins by giving away their private keys. He mentions his web interface tool for bitcoin-transactions, which allows users to move their coins without any fees. However, he acknowledges that it is currently not advisable to use private keys on this tool. He suggests that an offline tool would be ideal if there is some incentive to do so. Vitte claims that his web interface tool, located at https://peersm.com/wallet, is the only online tool that can convert bech32 addresses, decode redeem scripts, and create transactions on its own. He emphasizes that using private keys on this platform is not recommended until it becomes an offline tool. The discussion also touches upon the issue of invalid bech32 addresses from Electrum wallets after segwit, which has caused confusion among users. Overall, Vitte believes that a safe and secure tool like his web interface would be a positive step forward for mainstream bitcoin users who value efficiency and simplicity. In addition, he provides links to various projects he is involved in on GitHub, including Bitcoin wallets made simple, Zcash wallets made simple, Peersm, torrent-live, node-Tor, and GitHub.</summary>
