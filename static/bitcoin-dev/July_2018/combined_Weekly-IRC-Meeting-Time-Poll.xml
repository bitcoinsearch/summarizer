    <summary>On July 10, 2018, Cory Fields initiated a poll for Bitcoin Core contributors to determine their availability for online meetings. The purpose of the poll is to schedule the weekly IRC meetings at a time that would accommodate more participants. While the meetings themselves are unrelated to Bitcoin research and discussion, they are open to all. Initially, the list of voters was based on previous meeting participation. However, if someone regularly attends the meetings or cannot attend at the current time, they were encouraged to contact Cory on IRC to be added to the list.Cory sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, requesting input on the best times for developers to meet online. He created a poll to gather votes for the most suitable time for the weekly IRC meetings, which are currently fixed on Thursdays. The initial list of voters was compiled based on previous meeting attendance. If any regular attendees did not receive a link to vote, they were requested to reply to the email or ping Cory on IRC to be included. The polling will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th. The email provided links to the mailing list and the poll.In July 2018, Cory Fields sent an email to the bitcoin-dev mailing list, discussing a poll he had created to determine the availability of developers for online meetings.

The purpose of the poll was to collect data on the best times for weekly IRC meetings in order to minimize exclusions. The polling process began with an initial list of voters based on previous meeting participation and will end with the conclusion of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th. Attendees who regularly participate in the meetings or those who could attend at a different time but did not receive a voting link were requested to reply or contact Cory on IRC to be included.A recent email from Cory Fields was shared on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, where he requested participants to take part in a poll determining their availability for online meetings. The objective of the poll is to potentially reschedule the weekly IRC meetings to a time that would accommodate more people, as discussed during the previous week's meeting. The voting link will be sent via civs at cs.cornell.edu, and currently, the meetings are fixed for Thursdays. Initially, the list of voters was based on previous meeting attendance. However, if regular attendees did not receive a link within an hour, they were advised to reply to the post or contact Cory on IRC. The polling process will conclude at the end of the scheduled IRC meeting on July 19th.</summary>
