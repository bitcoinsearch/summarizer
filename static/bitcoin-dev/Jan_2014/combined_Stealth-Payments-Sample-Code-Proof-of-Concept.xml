    <summary>On January 13, 2014, a transaction was made on the Bitcoin TestNet, where Jeremy Spilman spent 1BTC to a stealth address. Mike Hearn questioned whether this transaction could be redeemed. Spilman shared the code he used to generate the transaction on GitHub, which was based on a private C# bitcoin implementation. The libraries used were standard Bitcoin/EC/BIP32 stuff using OpenSSL instead of BouncyCastle.During their discussion, Hearn and Spilman considered whether the 0BTC OP_RETURN transactions should be hidden from the Transaction List. They agreed that displaying "Payment received from Jeremy, 0.1 BTC" would be more appropriate than showing the transaction details. They also suggested changing the name of the address column from "Merchant" to "Recipient."Hearn proposed extending the wallet format to keep 'd2'/'Q2' unencrypted for testing purposes but not as a stand-alone private key. He expressed concern about the possibility of people detecting such payments by testing if decrypted values are points on the curve, although he was unsure about the specific risks involved.Eventually, Spilman's stealth redemption transaction was successfully sent using sendrawtransaction. He signed off for the night, concluding their discussion.In summary, the conversation on January 13, 2014, revolved around a Bitcoin transaction on the TestNet. Spilman spent 1BTC to a stealth address, prompting discussions about redeeming the transaction, hiding 0BTC OP_RETURN transactions from the Transaction List, and potential changes to the wallet format. There were also concerns about the security risks associated with detecting such payments and verifying the transactions.</summary>
