    <summary>In January 2014, a user named DÃ¢niel Fraga shared his experience of receiving a small donation without any fees attached. He expressed concern that such transactions are typically rejected by miners and wondered if there was a way for the receiver to pay the fee when the sender didn't. Fraga suggested that Bitcoin-qt could warn the receiver about receiving a transaction without a fee and offer the option to attach a fee for faster confirmation.In response to Fraga's suggestion, Ben Davenport explained that there is no need for protocol changes to allow the receiver to pay a fee. He suggested creating a transaction that spends the output to oneself and attaching a fee to it. In order for miners to grab the transaction fee, they would also have to mine the original transaction. While this process may currently require manual intervention, software could be developed to simplify it.Christophe Biocca also emphasized the importance of miners recognizing and accounting for the situation of &quot;child pays for parent patch.&quot; Currently, only eligius is running it, but proposals have been made to merge it into mainline. Biocca believed that if a transaction is relayed directly to Eligius, it would likely get mined. However, he noted that creating the transaction is considered the difficult part. Biocca further suggested that mining nodes should not be running mainline and instead set up their own customized transaction policies.Overall, the discussion highlighted the challenges associated with transactions without fees and proposed solutions to allow the receiver to pay a fee. While some ideas are already being implemented by certain miners, there is potential for further improvements in the future.</summary>
