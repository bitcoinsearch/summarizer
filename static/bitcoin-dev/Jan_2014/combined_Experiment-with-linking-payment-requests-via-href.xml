    <summary>In certain situations, using a file approach to download and open a Bitcoin URI may be the most suitable option. However, this method requires an extra click using a download manager, which can be inconvenient for some users. To address this issue, a Bitcoin URI with r= parameter can eliminate the need for the additional click. However, it may not always be applicable, especially when sending payment requests through messaging apps or email attachments.During a conversation between Andreas Schildbach and an unidentified individual, it was proposed that using .bitcoinpaymentrequest files with the appropriate MIME type would be preferable over packing a file into a URL. Andreas agreed to implement this suggestion. However, he encountered difficulties when attempting to use this method. Both Chrome and the AOSP browser insisted on handling the link with their respective download managers, necessitating an extra click. Furthermore, Firefox ignored the click altogether. It is worth noting that the download manager was a separate component that could not be updated with the browser. Despite registering the correct MIME type and setting the MIME type of the href, Andreas faced this challenge. He provided a link to the href on http://wallet.schildbach.de, which redirects to Gavin's generator. Although Andreas did not attempt using suffixes, he assumed they would behave similarly. Seeking assistance, he asked for suggestions regarding alternative approaches to try.</summary>
