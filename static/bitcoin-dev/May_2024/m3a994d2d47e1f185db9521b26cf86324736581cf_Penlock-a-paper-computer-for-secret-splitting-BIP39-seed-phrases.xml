    <summary>In exploring the concept of using a slide wheel for recovery windows, it's noted that a different ordering is necessary compared to what is used for addition. This might necessitate introducing a second wheel and altering the labeling of recovery windows. The rationale behind this consideration stems from an observation that recovery windows, which are essentially differences of characters, should theoretically follow a similar pattern to that of addition, albeit possibly in reverse. This area is highlighted as worthy of further investigation.

However, the practicality of implementing such a system is questioned. It's suggested that if adapting the slide wheel for recovery windows proves complex and requires additional components, the benefits may not justify the efforts. Given that recovery windows need to be referenced only once per share, the ease of use (or ergonomics) of the volvelle is less critical. Furthermore, the setup or construction time is deemed manageable since the number of windows needed correlates directly with the number of shares, suggesting a scalable and not overly burdensome process.

The message concludes by underscoring that, despite theoretical considerations, practical implications might limit the utility of adding complexity to the system.
