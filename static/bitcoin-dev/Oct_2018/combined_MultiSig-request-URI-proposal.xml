    <summary>In a discussion on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, user おのかちお has proposed an idea for a new URI scheme that would enable multisig requests from websites to users' local wallets. Currently, there is no Multisig request URI in Bitcoin's BIP 21, and the writer suggests the implementation of a bitcoin-sigreq URI scheme to address this gap.The proposed bitcoin-sigreq URI scheme would include the raw transaction encoded in base64, as well as parameters such as the public key for the sign key pair and the path for HD wallet position. This would allow websites to send multisig requests directly to users' local wallets, enabling them to participate in on-chain multisig transactions.However, the writer acknowledges potential issues with using a URI scheme for two-way communication in the context of on-chain multisig transactions. These transactions require multiple parties to provide signatures and one party to aggregate and publish the transaction. While BIP72 allows for callbacks to be included in the URI, it was designed for one-way communication and may not be suitable for two-way communication.Given these concerns, the author suggests exploring alternative methods that are better suited for two-way communication instead of solely relying on the URI system. The writer seeks feedback and input from the community on the proposed bitcoin-sigreq URI scheme and its feasibility in facilitating multisig requests between websites and users' local wallets.Overall, the proposed idea aims to enhance the functionality of Bitcoin's BIP 21 by introducing a new URI scheme specifically designed for multisig requests. By allowing websites to communicate directly with users' local wallets, this scheme could streamline the process of participating in on-chain multisig transactions. However, further consideration is needed to address the challenges associated with two-way communication using a URI scheme.</summary>
