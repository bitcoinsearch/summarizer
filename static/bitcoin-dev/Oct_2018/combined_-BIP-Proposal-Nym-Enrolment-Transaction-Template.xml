    <summary>Велеслав has submitted a proposal for a new transaction template that can be used as a cryptographic pseudonym. This proposal is specific to the application layer of Bitcoin and does not involve any consensus changes. Kalle has raised a few comments and questions regarding the proposal. He inquired about why only one input is required and why type p2wpkh on input is demanded. Kalle also questioned the necessity of verifying "SIZE 32 EQUALVERIFY" on output 2 and the requirement for a segwit version 0 change output. Additionally, he sought clarification on the distinction between IsStandard rules and nym protocol rules in the specification section. Kalle couldn't locate information about 1-byte-nym_version and 1-byte-nym_use and their usage.The writer's draft BIP proposes a new transaction template that adopts the next available transaction version number. The objective of this proposal is to establish a unique transaction structure that serves as a cryptographic pseudonym. It should be noted that this proposal is not intended to introduce any consensus changes but rather focuses on the application layer of Bitcoin. The writer expresses hope that the community will find this proposal valuable and encourages a thorough review.For detailed information on the proposal, it can be found on Github at https://github.com/veleslavs/bips/blob/bip_nym_tx/bip-nym_tx.mediawiki. Велеслав extends gratitude to the entire team who provided support during the creation of this proposal.</summary>
