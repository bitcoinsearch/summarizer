In response, Wladimir stated that his girlfriend hates Valentine's Day, so it was acceptable for him. Gavin jokingly suggested that after discussing technical matters, they could exchange bitcoins with addresses containing cute Valentine's Day messages.In addition to the meeting invitation, Gavin also included an advertisement for LearnDevNow, an online learning library for Microsoft developers priced at $99.99.Overall, Gavin Andresen invited members of the Bitcoin development mailing list to a meeting to discuss various topics, including the status of BIP 16 support and a protocol change scheduled for February 20.
