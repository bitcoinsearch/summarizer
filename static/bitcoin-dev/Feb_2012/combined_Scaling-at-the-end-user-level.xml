    <summary>In a discussion about distributing a precomputed bootstrap chain for Bitcoin, various options are proposed including using rsync or db_dump &gt; git &gt; db_load methods. However, some people express concerns that this approach goes against the distributed nature of Bitcoin. One suggestion is to use Git repos backed by strong hashes, with each commit representing a single block dump, and trusted entities signing at checkpoints/heights. The development of blockchain tools is seen as crucial for this approach.One user reports that their client on an old P4 computer has been idly working on building and verifying the initial chain for about a week. They question whether this is feasible for new users and inquire if any proposals have been published for distributing a precomputed bootstrap chain. The user also highlights that there is significant compression available in the index and chain.Wladimir, believed to be Bitcoin's lead developer, responds to the proposal acknowledging that he had previously suggested packaging part of the block chain. However, he notes that this could pose challenges as users would have to rely on the packager for accurate information if the imported chain is not validated. On the other hand, validating the chain would still require a significant amount of time for the user's computer.The issue of artificial slowdown linked to database file locking and flushing is discussed. It is found that the problem is not related to the age of the computer but rather how truthfully the database file is written to disk. Different operating systems seem to handle this differently, resulting in varying processing speeds. The default settings of the db lib used by Bitcoin may also play a role in this issue.Overall, the need for a more efficient method of building and verifying the initial chain is recognized. While proposals for distributing a precomputed bootstrap chain are put forward, further investigation and development of blockchain tools are needed. Additionally, the issue of database file locking and flushing is highlighted as a potential obstacle that needs to be addressed.</summary>
