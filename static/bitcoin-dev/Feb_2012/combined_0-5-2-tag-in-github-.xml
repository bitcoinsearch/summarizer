    <summary>In a 2012 email conversation, Aidan Thornton expressed uncertainty about the location of a specific tag for the stable version of Bitcoin's codebase. He speculated that "developer politics" may have been involved and suggested that v0.5.2 may not have been pushed to the official Github repository. However, it was clarified in response that no such politics were at play, and cuts to stable versions were always made from Luke's repository since he maintained it.Meanwhile, Michael Gronager, a director at Ceptacle, was attempting to redo a performance test of the libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client, which had seen improvements in speed compared to version 0.4.0. However, he encountered difficulty in finding the v0.5.2 tag on Github. Aidan Thornton suggested that the tag might be located in a different repository and hinted at potential developer politics. Additionally, Michael inquired about the addition of new checkpoints and questioned if there was any policy or logic behind it, noting that the number could potentially be raised to 160000 by now.To further clarify the situation, Michael Grønager, a developer, sought to redo the performance test of the libcoin client against the 0.5.2 Satoshi client, which had experienced significant speed improvements since version 0.4.0 by not verifying signatures on early blocks. However, he was unable to locate any tag with v0.5.2 in Github's repository. Michael wondered if he was missing something or if the release had not been properly tagged. Specifically, he was searching for the number "140700," which represented the last block not verified and could be found in checkpoints.cpp. Nevertheless, he desired confirmation that this was indeed the number used in version 0.5.2.</summary>
