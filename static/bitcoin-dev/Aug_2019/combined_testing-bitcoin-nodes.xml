    <summary>Niels Thijssen, a software test specialist running a private full Bitcoin node on Raspberry Pi 4, has reached out for guidance regarding the tests performed during installation, upgrade, and compilation of software for the node. He is specifically interested in obtaining an overview of the common approach to testing and refining test cases. Niels has attempted to utilize the tests available on GitHub but has found them lacking in helpfulness. He is now seeking assistance from individuals who can either join him in his pursuit of knowledge or provide relevant information that can guide him in the testing process.It is important to note that the email thread containing this inquiry ends with a standard disclaimer from Improve Quality Services B.V., stating that the email and any files transmitted may contain proprietary and confidential information.
